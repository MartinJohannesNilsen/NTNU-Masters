2015-07-06,"The material world is a lie The material world is a lie. For so long we have been taught that what’s important in life is to buy this and have that. To always have the latest fashion, biggest tv, fanciest car, nicest house, and blah,blah, blah. Well, the truth is we’ve become so attached to these things, our spiritual development has been halted. Just like they say in fight club “We become owned by the things we own”. Most people will spend hours standing in front of stores just to buy a new iphone. Those same people will complain about how they don’t have enough money but will always have money to spend on apple products. This attachment produces so much of the stress and worrying in the world today. I used to be like that, always concerned about what clothes I had, rather than whether or not I was happy. But not anymore. Since then I have learned the truth that such attachments are falsehoods and will only bring misery.This is my first blog post, there will be more to come.",Chris Harper Mercer,1,1,184,18.75,28.14,67.7,6.28,16.73,11.96,92.39,73.37,61.96,13.59,6.52,2.72,2.72,0,0,1.09,7.07,15.22,5.98,0.54,11.96,14.67,8.7,7.61,1.63,20.65,8.15,4.35,4.35,3.26,0,1.09,11.41,1.63,9.78,1.09,2.17,0,0.54,0,4.35,0,7.61,2.72,4.35,4.89,0.54,3.8,1.09,0,0,0,8.15,3.8,0,0,1.09,0,1.09,3.8,0,0,0,0,2.17,0,0,2.17,5.43,1.09,0.54,1.63,1.63,0.54,1.09,0.54,0,0.54,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.09,0.54,1.63,0,0,0,9.78,7.07,0,1.09,6.52,0,0,0,4.89,4.89,5.43,2.72,0,0,0,0,0,15.22,6.52,5.98,0,0,1.63,1.09,0
2015-08-31,"As I’m sure you all know, a few days ago there was a shooting in Virginia. A man named Vester Flanagan opened fire on two former colleagues on live tv. He also recorded his own footage of the event. While reading about the event, I read some excerpts of his manifesto the media was releasing. And I have to say, anyone who knew him could have seen this coming. People like him have nothing left to live for, and the only thing left to do is lash out at a society that has abandoned them. His family described him as alone, no partner/lover. A victim not only of his own perception but also of our social media soaked enviroment. He posted the footage on facebook and twitter as well tweeting while he was running from the cops because he wanted the world to see his actions, much like many others post menial and trivial details of their life online and expect us to see it. Only his was at least a bit more interesting. On an interesting note, I have noticed that so many people like him are all alone and unknown, yet when they spill a little blood, the whole world knows who they are. A man who was known by no one, is now known by everyone. His face splashed across every screen, his name across the lips of every person on the planet, all in the course of one day.

2015-09-01,"Houston Cop Shooting I just read about the houston cop shooting. Figured I’d post this since the response to my previous blog post on vester flanagan was so interesting. On the houston shooting it was reported that the suspect was influenced by black lives matter protests/movement. Although I don’t know if thats true, with all the issues about police and blacks/protestors in the news the past couple of years, it certainly seems like someone would be inspired to take action. With the constant chants of anti police rhetoric this was bound to happen. I don’t disagree that police brutality and excessive use of force is a problem, but killing an officer that never did anything to you is not the answer. This whole event seems similar to the one in new york earlier this year where that guy killed those two cops sitting in a parked car. The inflammatory rhetoric on both sides, whether warranted or not will only continue to agitate the situation and events such as these will happen more and more. These are just my thoughts on the matter. Will continue to post more blogs on related subjects, as well any interesting thoughts I may have. P.S. In case anyone’s wondering, I’m not on the side of the suspect, I’m on the side of the officer, and generally don’t agree with the black lives matter protests",Chris Harper Mercer,1,1,232,65.77,11.03,73.33,25.82,19.33,22.41,87.93,68.53,56.47,11.64,4.31,3.88,0,0.43,0,0,7.33,18.97,9.05,0.43,14.66,9.48,4.74,6.03,3.02,15.09,6.47,4.31,5.17,0,0,5.17,19.4,1.72,17.67,5.17,2.16,0.86,4.74,0.43,3.88,0,3.88,2.16,1.72,0.43,0.43,0,0,0,0,0,9.05,5.17,0,0,3.02,0,2.59,3.88,0,0,0,0.43,1.29,0,0,1.29,0.43,0,0,0.43,0,0,2.16,0.43,0.43,0,0,0,0,0,0.86,0,0,0.43,0,0.43,0,0,0,1.72,2.16,6.03,0,0.86,4.31,0.86,0,0,4.31,4.31,5.6,1.72,0.43,0,0.43,0,0,12.5,5.17,3.45,0,0,3.02,0.86,0
