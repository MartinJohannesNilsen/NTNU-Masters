NaN,"Max showed up. I was really happy to see him. I couldn‚Äôt believe I was actually in France again. Max and I stayed at his grandmother‚Äôs house in Montpellier. Montpellier was an exquisite city, with a romantic and cultured vibe to it. It was such a pity that I was too caught up in my own world to truly appreciate it at the time. Max introduced me to his life in France. I met with some of his friends and we went to bars together. In France, the legal drinking age is 16, so I was able to drink alcohol at a bar. It was astounding! For those three weeks, I had the faintest taste of what life was like for normal young people. The experience of hanging out with a group of young people, boys and girls, and enjoying life was something I never did before. It really turned my whole world around, for that short amount of time. So this is what everyone else gets to experience, I thought to myself with jealousy. I felt a sense of happiness and bliss that I hadn‚Äôt felt since childhood, when life was good. During the trip, we visited the town of Arles where we stayed in the hotel that Max‚Äôs family owns. Max told me about all of the sexual experiences he had. I never knew he had such an active sex life. The more he talked to me about it, the more envious I became. I questioned to myself why he got to experience such an amazing life, while I had to suffer so much loneliness and humiliation. I was introduced to some of the girls he had sex with in the past, and they were all pretty. On top of that, his family was extremely wealthy and they owned a sprawling mansion in the countryside. Where‚Äôs the justice? I thought. Why couldn‚Äôt I have been born into that life? I envied Max so much. His life must have been heaven on earth. Despite my envy of Max, I couldn‚Äôt hate him, at least at that time. He was the only popular young person who ever reached out to me. He invited me to visit his home, and he treated me like a friend. For that, I will always have a grudging respect for Max Bonon. After three weeks in France doing exciting social things, I returned to my lonely life in the U.S., where I became even more depressed than I was in the beginning of summer, especially after getting a taste of what life was truly like for normal people. I knew I could never live such a pleasurable life, and the knowledge haunted me. I was back to my routine of World of Warcraft. At least the new expansion was coming out soon, and I tried to look forward to that. When Twelfth Grade began, I made a vow to finish high school before the month of March.

NaN,"of one of his ex-girlfriends, a pretty brunette white girl. My hatred towards him only intensified after that. I refused to speak to him whenever he came over, and I constantly pestered my mother to ban him from the house, but she refused to heed my demands. Even worse, she constantly talked about him admiringly. He reminded me of Leo Bubenheim, a typical obnoxious boy who has been able to experience a great sex life from a young age. An enemy had now infiltrated the household of my mother, the one place in the whole world where I‚Äôve always sought refuge from injustice. Things were getting too out of hand. Grandma Jinx came to visit father‚Äôs house in late October. When she last visited, she resolved an intense conflict between me, my father, and Soumaya. In a way, this recent visit paralleled the last one, since I was having conflicts with Soumaya this time as well, just not to the same extreme. I went over to father‚Äôs house to see my grandmother. She suggested that I take her out for a coffee, and I knew just the place. I took her to Barnes & Noble at the Calabasas Commons, a place of great significance in my past. While there, I showed her all of the spots I had spent time at years ago. Afterward, before I said my goodbye, a feeling of sadness swept over me, as I knew that was most likely the final farewell. On Halloween, I found it hard to believe how fast time had gone by. I remember how on the last Halloween I had considered exacting my Retribution on this very day. Time indeed will inevitably pass, and soon enough my fate will have to be decided. I went home to my mother‚Äôs on Halloween, of course. I wouldn‚Äôt be able to stand being alone in my Isla Vista room while all of that partying happened around me. It was the exact same scenario as last year. In the afternoon, I saw a new psychologist, Dr. Randy Gold. In truth, he was my old psychologist whom I visited briefly when I was only thirteen. That was back when my life was just starting to fall into this dark path, and now I was still in the same position, except that the dark path was soon going to reach its climactic end. After my therapy session, I got drunk in my mother‚Äôs hot tub, trying not to think about all of the fun and sex that other young people were having that night. Nothing came out of my desperate outings in Santa Barbara during the last months of 2013. Girls still didn‚Äôt show any interest in me. I drove to SBCC a lot, even though I was only signed up for online classes. While there, I saw other boys who had inferior cars driving around with hot girls in their passenger seats. I have a BMW and never had any hot girl in my passenger seat. Not once. It only made me fume with rage.

NaN,"my enemies. They showed me no mercy, and in turn I will show them no mercy. The prospect will be so sweet, and justice will ultimately be served. And of course, I would have to die in the act to avoid going to prison. That is when I realized that this threshold existed, and if I crossed it, I will have to carry out this Day of Retribution. It has remained stagnant in the back of my mind ever since, until this point. After dropping my Spring classes at Santa Barbara City College, I knew that the Day of Retribution was now very possible. I even wrote about it in my diary, but I later tore out the pages because I feared someone might find them. A shiver ran through me, realizing how twisted my world had become, that I would have to resort to doing something that I would consider unthinkable a few years ago. I didn‚Äôt want to do it. I wanted to live. Thinking about the Day of Retribution made me feel trapped. I wanted a way out. After some deep contemplation, I had the revelation that the Day of Retribution wasn‚Äôt the only way I could make up for all of the suffering I‚Äôve had to experience. If I could somehow become a multi- millionaire at a young age, then my lifestyle would instantly become better than most people my age. I would be able to get revenge on my enemies just by living above them and lording over them. That was a form of happy, peaceful revenge, and it became my only hope. Once again, I started to desperately ponder over ways that I could become extremely wealthy at a young age. It was my only way out. This is when I realized that wealth was the only way I could lose my virginity, the only way I could have the beautiful girlfriend I know I deserve. Due to all of my past experiences with girls, it is evident that girls are not attracted to me as a person. They are repulsed by me. The only way I could possible become worthy of their love and attraction is if I become wealthy. In the beginning of March, I went home in a sullen and disturbed mood. I did my best to hide it from my parents. I also had to hide the fact that I dropped all of my college classes, and I kept up the pretense that I was still attending college, talking to my father about my lectures and so forth. The weekend that I visited home was quite an eventful one, and I had been looking forward to it for some time. On Sunday, March 11th 2012, I went with my mother and sister to a private, exclusive Katy Perry concert; and on March 12th 2012 I went with my father and Soumaya to the red carpet premiere of the Hunger Games.

Niggs and spics bring it on to themselves, and another thing, I am very racist towards white trash P.O.S.‚Äôs like and they deserve the hatred, otherwise I probably wouldn‚Äôt hate them. It‚Äôs a tragedy, the human nature of people will lead to their downfall. People‚Äôs human nature will get them killed. Whether by me or Vodka, it‚Äôs happened before, and not just school shootings like those pussy dumbasses over in Minnesota who squealed. Throughout history, its our fucking nature! I know how people are and why and I can‚Äôt stand it! I love the Nazis too . . . by the way, I fucking can‚Äôt get enough of the swastika, the SS, and the iron cross. Hitler and his head boys fucked up a few times and it cost them the war, but I love their beliefs and who they were, what they did, and what they wanted.

Whatever I do people make fun of me, and sometimes directly to my face. I‚Äôll get revenge soon enough. Fuckers shouldn‚Äôt have ripped on me so much huh! Ha! Then again it‚Äôs human nature to do what you did . . . so I guess I am also attacking the human race. I can‚Äôt take it, it‚Äôs not right . . . true . . . correct . . . perfect. I fucking hate the human equation. Nazism would be fucking great if it weren‚Äôt for individualism and our natural instinct to ask questions. You know what maybe I just need to get laid. Maybe that‚Äôll just change some shit around. That‚Äôs another thing, I am a fucking dog. I have fantasies of just taking someone and fucking them hard and strong. Someone like where I just pick her up, take her to my room, tear off her shirt and pants and just eat her out and fuck her hard. I love flesh . . . weisses fleisch!

By doing this, I will set right all of the wrongs I‚Äôve had to face in my sorry excuse of a life. Every single time I‚Äôve seen a guy walk around with his beautiful girlfriend, I‚Äôve always wanted to kill them both in the most painful way possible. They deserve it. They must be punished. The males deserve to be punished for living a better and more pleasurable life than me, and the females deserve to be punished for giving that pleasurable life to those males instead of me. On the Day of Retribution, I will finally be able to punish them ALL. When I think about the amazing and blissful life I could have lived if only females were sexually attracted to me, my entire being burns with hatred. They denied me a happy life, and in return I will take away all of their lives. It is only fair. I am not part of the human race. Humanity has rejected me. The females of the human species have never wanted to mate with me, so how could I possibly consider myself part of humanity? Humanity has never accepted me among them, and now I know why. I am more than human. I am superior to them all. I am Elliot Rodger... Magnificent, glorious, supreme, eminent... Divine! I am the closest thing there is to a living god. Humanity is a disgusting, depraved, and evil species. It is my purpose to punish them all. I will purify the world of everything that is wrong with it. On the Day of Retribution, I will truly be a powerful god, punishing everyone I deem to be impure and depraved. Epilogue And that is how my tragic life ends. Who would have thought my life will turn out this way? I didn‚Äôt. There was a time when I thought this world was a good and happy place. As a child, my whole world was innocent. It wasn‚Äôt until I went through puberty and started desiring girls that my whole life turned into a living hell. I desired girls, but girls never desired me back. There is something very wrong with that. It is an injustice that cannot go unpunished. There is no way I could live a happy life with such a scenario. Not only did I have to waste my entire youth suffering in loneliness and unfulfilled desire, but I had to live with the knowledge that other boys my age were able to have all of the experiences I craved for. It is absolutely unfair and unjust. In addition, I had to suffer the shame of other boys respecting me less because I didn‚Äôt get any girls. Everyone knew I was a virgin. Everyone knew how undesirable I was to girls, and I hated everyone just for knowing it.

I kept hoping and hoping and hoping. Hope is what kept me alive. I continued seeing Philip and Addison, my only other social interaction besides James. I talked to Addison about my old political views, debating with him about what an ideal world would look like. I found out that he had some fascist views of his own, and it was nice to have a discussion with someone about things that would make most normal people run a mile. I frequently messaged Addison on Facebook, hoping to start up conversations when I felt lonely. He told me he was just starting his Twelfth Grade year at Malibu High School, and his goal was to fit in with the popular kids. Fitting in with popular kids at Malibu High School? I didn‚Äôt expect Addison to be successful in such a venture. Addison invited me to his birthday party. It was a small get-together on the beach in Point Dume, Malibu. I had a very hard time socializing with people, so I ended up drinking too much alcohol. Before Philip drove me home, I vomited outside Addison‚Äôs apartment, in front of his mother and everyone else. It was highly embarrassing and I put a lot of effort to block it from my mind afterwards. James came to my mother‚Äôs new apartment for a sleepover. We walked to the Calabasas Commons together. It was nice to show him all of my favorite spots there, like the window at Barnes & Noble that overlooks the whole area, and turtle ponds next to King‚Äôs restaurant. It was a great place to talk and contemplate. We had some deep conversations about our fantasies and our hopes for the future. When I was a child, Halloween used to be a fun and exciting experience, but ever since the last time I went trick-or-treating Halloween has been a time when I spent the whole night in my room while other teenagers were out having fun partying. On this Halloween, I was desperate to do something social. I just couldn‚Äôt sit in my room on such a night. I found out from stalking random people on Facebook that there was going to be a huge house party in West Hills. I decided to take a big leap forward and attend this house party, even though I wouldn‚Äôt know anybody there. I had nothing to lose, and it would give me more of a chance of meeting girls than if I stayed in my room all night. Because I couldn‚Äôt drive, I had to walk all the way there, and it took 45 minutes. When I got there, I was overcome by anxiety, but I couldn‚Äôt back out at that point.

NaN,"couple of months after my birth, I went on my first vacation. My parents took me on a boat to France. I was already a traveler! Of course, I have no memories of this trip. My mother said that I cried a lot. At the time that I was born, my mother and father were living in a house in London, but shortly after my birth they decided to move to the countryside. We moved to a large house made of red brick in the county of Sussex, with vast grass fields surrounding it. The house even had a name: The Old Rectory. This was where I spent my early childhood, the first five years of my life, and it was beautiful. The memories I have of this period are only memories of happiness and bliss. My father was a professional photographer at the time, just in the stage of becoming a director. My mother gave up her nursing career to stay at home and look after me. My grandma on my mother‚Äôs side, who I would call Ah Mah, moved in with us to help out my mother. I would spend a lot of time with Ah Mah during these years. This was a time of discovery, excitement, and fun. I had just entered this new world, and I knew nothing of the pain it would bring me later on. I enjoyed life with innocent bliss. I can remember playing in the fields and going on long walks with Ah Mah to pick berries. She would always warn me not to touch the stinging nettles that sometimes grew in our fields, but my curiosity got the better of me, and I got stung a few times. There was a swing in the back of our yard, which I had many good times on. The first birthday I remember was my 3rd birthday. My parents threw a party for me in our field. I had a helicopter birthday cake. I can remember one of my friend‚Äôs parents cutting off the first piece and giving it to my friend. I threw a tantrum because I was expecting to get the first piece... It was my birthday after all. My father bought me a toy tractor that I could ride around in, and I would play with it all the time after that. Sometime after my 3rd birthday, we all went on a vacation to Malaysia, my mother‚Äôs home country. I have only flashes of memory of that vacation. I enjoyed it very much. We visited a few of my mother‚Äôs relatives. For preschool, I was enrolled at Dorsett House, an upscale all-boys private school in the countryside, near where we lived. I was forced to wear a uniform, which I hated because I had to wear uncomfortable socks up to my knees. I was very nervous and I cried on my first day there. I can remember two friends I made by name, George and David. I would always play in the sandpit with them. I didn‚Äôt like school at Dorsett House",Elliot Rodger,1,1,511,13.81,15.07,80.23,16.83,12.92,1.57,14.48,0,0.78,0.78,0,7.83,15.46,2.15,3.72,2.54,0.59,0,1.17,0.39,0.2,0.39,3.91,0.39,0.59,1.96,0,0.98,1.37,0.98,0.2,0.39,0.39,7.05,0.78,2.35,0.39,2.94,0,5.48,8.02,3.91,0,4.31,1.96,0.2,7.05,2.35,2.35,2.15,0.39,0.39,1.37,2.54,1.96,0.59,0,0,0.59,0,0,0,0.39,0.39,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.2,13.5,7.24,4.7,0.2,0,0,0.2,0.2,0,0.98,0,0,0

NaN,"we were finished with Gelsons‚Äôs, she drove me to my father‚Äôs house and told him about what happened. They agreed to take me out of Taft. I didn‚Äôt go to school for a month while my parents decided what to do with me. I took advantage of the time to rest and recover at home, playing my online games. The pain and suffering I had to endure at Taft was all over, but the scars would remain. I tried to forget about it as much as I could. I took a deep breath and relaxed. After a month of recovery, my parents took me to look at two continuation high schools, which operate like home-schooling because you only spend three hours a day there and do the rest of the work at home. One of them was right next to El Camino High School, the other one was in Van Nuys. My parents preferred the one in Van Nuys because they felt it was more structured and organized. It was called Independence High School, and they decided to send me there. Independence was a very small school with only three buildings and 100 students. The teachers were all very nice and understanding, and it had a relaxed and calm environment. I figured this was the best option for me. A week later, I started going to Independence High School. I didn‚Äôt like any of the students there, as they were all slobs with the exception of two or three boys. This wasn‚Äôt a major concern, because I didn‚Äôt care about having a social life at the point. All I wanted to do was hide away from the cruel world by playing my online games, and Independence High School gave me the perfect opportunity to do just that. I only had to be at school for three or four hours per day, and all of the work was very easy with teachers available to help me with anything. After those short school hours, I had all the time in the world to do whatever I wanted, and I spent it playing World of Warcraft. One drawback was that I had to take the bus to school because my parents couldn‚Äôt pick me up at such an early time of the day. Though it was embarrassing, I didn‚Äôt care about appearances anymore, so I didn‚Äôt make a big deal out of it. This was the perfect set up for a World of Warcraft addict. After school, every day, I fully indulged myself in my addiction to WoW. My only social interaction was with my online friends and with James, who would occasionally come over to my house to play WoW with me.

NaN,"bypass surgery: I consulted 2 cardiac surgeons and both did not recommend it, while the cardiologists, who did recommend bypass surgery, were not surgeons themselves. Next, I reminded Mayrand that it was her colleague Ayas, who recommended the angioplasty and he did it because he felt my life to be in danger. Mayrand still insisted that I had to undergo bypass surgery, she could not though tell bypass surgery of WHICH artery. Finally, she understood the stupidity of her position and hastily exited. While she was getting out, I told her that as soon as she figured out which artery should be bypassed, I agree in advance. Several minutes later, she returned back and admitted that it were indeed Quebec surgeons, who did NOT recommend bypass surgery. Her next idea was to call B.C. doctor and ask him whether he would be ready to perform a new angioplasty, and if yes, she would send me there. Imagine the stupidity: to go from one end of the country to another for an elementary procedure, which can be easily done here. By the evening of July 16, 2002, I was finally told that the angiography will be done at the Sacre-Coeur hospital on July 19. I guess, Quebec doctors understood that their actions were clear and shameless murder, so they backed off. Angioplasty was performed on July 19, 2002, and it showed that I was right yet gain: jail doctor Coche brought me to the brink of death indeed. Almost all arteries were re-stenosed, and the main Right Coronary artery was blocked 80%; a small clot there would kill me for sure. It also showed that Quebec doctors were perfectly qualified to do the job, and were refusing out of maliciousness, helping Canadian Government to kill me. On my return from the hospital I spoke with jail doctor Coche. I asked him whether the results of the last angioplasty convinced him that he made serious mistakes by ignoring my symptoms for over 3 weeks, by refusing to call an ambulance, and by effectively bringing me to the brink of death yet again. He admitted that I could have died, but insisted that he did nothing wrong. In 1994, a guard has broken my ribs and a doctor did her best to cover up this crime. I complained to police, they not only refused to press charges, they did not even bother to interview the criminal guard, though they had in their possession a video-tape of the crime. I went to court against the doctor also, and judge Goodwin decided that I had not a shred of evidence (look for another posting for details). CONCLUSION I was abused for 12 years, and when my life was threatened, the abusers succeeded in provoking me. I lived so far 62 years, during which I never displayed any violent behavior, I never had even a speeding ticket; there were 3 minutes in my life when I killed 4 people. Should I be judged by these 3 minutes or by remaining 62 years?

NaN,"be the next Halloween of 2013. That would give me a year to prepare, but I soon dismissed it. If the Day of Retribution were to happen, it would have to be on a normal weekend. There would be too many cops walking around during an event like Halloween, and cops are the only ones who could hinder my plans. I spent the time at mother‚Äôs house relaxing and trying to forget about Halloween. I drank some of my mother‚Äôs delicious wine until I was too buzzed to think about how much fun everyone else my age was having on that night. I didn‚Äôt even bother to register for college classes that semester. There was no point. I believed that I would either fulfill my dream of becoming wealthy at a young age in order to be worthy enough to attract beautiful women, or exact my revenge upon the world and die in the process to escape punishment. There was no other path for me. Of course, I ‚Äúregistered‚Äù for some classes, but only to keep up the pretense to my parents that I was still attending college. If they somehow found out that I had dropped my classes right after registering for them, they would have stopped all of their support for me, and my life would have to end right then and there. Thankfully, I was a good liar. During the Autumn of 2012, I had all the time in the world to figure out how I was going to triumph against the society that was torturing me. I spent a lot of time at the library in Goleta, just a few miles away from Isla Vista. At the library, I read countless books on history, business, and philosophy, learning as much as I could. It was better than staying at home in my room. Besides, I didn‚Äôt want my housemates to find out that I wasn‚Äôt going to college. That would be embarrassing, and I always cared about what others thought about me, even my nerdy housemates. I continued to visit the website of the Megamillions lottery. I still clung to the hope that it may rise above $100 million again and I would be the winner. So far, I saw that as my only way out of my horrible situation. My situation was indeed horrible. I couldn‚Äôt leave the house without seeing a young couple walking around somewhere. Everywhere I went, I was all by myself, while other young people had friends and girlfriends. I was ashamed to show myself to the world. Even though I wore expensive designer clothes, what was the point if girl‚Äôs still weren‚Äôt attracted to me? No one respects a man who is unable to get a woman. A man wearing shorts and a T-shirt would be seen as superior to me if he walks into a store with a beautiful girl on his arm and I walk in all alone. A man having a beautiful girl by his side shows the world that he is worth something, because obviously that beautiful",Elliot Rodger,1,1,511,17.03,17.03,83.37,12.92,10.18,0,10.18,0,1.57,1.76,0.2,7.24,16.44,0.98,5.28,3.72,0.39,0.78,1.57,0,0.59,0.2,7.63,0.78,1.76,3.91,0.2,1.96,1.37,1.37,1.17,0,0,5.09,0.2,1.76,0.39,0.59,1.76,5.48,6.46,4.11,1.57,4.11,1.37,0,4.11,5.28,1.57,3.52,2.74,0.2,0.59,1.37,1.17,0,0.2,0,0.98,0.2,0,0.2,0.59,0.2,0,0.2,0.2,0,0,0,0.2,12.52,5.48,4.5,0,0,0.2,0,0.2,0.39,1.57,0,0.2,0

NaN,"I was missing something. I wanted to cry whenever group projects would be issued. I was always one of, if not the last person to partner up. I felt like a nobody. Here were all of these kids that conversed with ease and wanted to interact, whereas I would rather sit in the front of the class near the teacher. I desperately wanted people to like me, but at the same time leave me alone completely. It was something beyond being just an introvert. I just felt lost. I started to learn that things couldn‚Äôt be handed to you in life. You had to make decisions and you had to make friends on your own. I did make some friends in elementary school. Although I made friends in school I never hung out with them out of school. I was afraid to even call them on the phone. Hell, I was afraid to call my own grandmother on the phone fearing my grandfather would answer; I would always hang up on him. The first sad memory that I can truly say that changed my life was when my friend Michael moved away in first grade. It was emotional for me and I really don‚Äôt understand why because I barely knew the kid. I just remember hugging him and fighting back tears on his last day at school. To be fair he wasn‚Äôt the coolest kid either. That memory stuck with me for a while for some reason but it had no control over me on trying to make and keep friends. In first grade I met someone who would help make me the person I am today; Matthew Gilbert. We were both big football fans and enjoyed recording with video cameras; it was the perfect combination. He was the first friend that I felt like I could tell anything to. We made a bunch of videos together on mini DV tapes. They started from just simple plots of two boys that wanted to try and find a friend, to parodies of Wes Craven‚Äôs, ‚ÄúScream‚Äù. Matt helped me realize my love for the video camera. Whenever we would hang out I can remember begging him to make some videos with me. I didn‚Äôt even care what they were about; I just loved to record things with the camera and be able to watch them back on my television later on. I think a big reason why is because I loved to remember the moments we had together as friends and be able to relive them whenever I wanted. It got to a point where he grew tired of repeating the same formula for a video, and we just stopped doing them. I however kept making them with just myself in them. From the first time I ever picked up a video camera and looked into the viewfinder, to the videos I made with Matt, my love for film never faded. I remember watching movies like ‚ÄúTitanic‚Äù, ‚ÄúScream‚Äù, ‚ÄúPirates of the Caribbean‚Äù, and ‚ÄúHarry Potter‚Äù, and just being in awe of them.

NaN,"up. The new Song of Ice and Fire book, A Dance with Dragons, was released. I emailed my mother to order me the book from Amazon. The countdown was ultimately over, and I had nothing to show for it. I was still a virgin, even after a month of living in a town full of college kids who had sex all the time. I realized that I had only twelve more days as a teenager! I was going to turn twenty very soon. One of my hopes was to at least lose my virginity before my time as a teenager was over. Being a virgin at the age of twenty would make me feel very defeated. I made a bid to do everything I could to lose my virginity in those few remaining days I had. With a tremendous amount of panic, I wondered what I could possible do. The only thing I could think of was to go out to the common areas of Isla Vista as much as possible. I had to put myself out there, even if it only increased my chances of having sex by one percent. One percent was still better than zero. For those crucial twelve days I had left as a teenager, I walked over to the center of Isla Vista every day and sat at one of the tables outside Domino‚Äôs Pizza, hoping against hope that a girl would come up and talk to me. Why wouldn‚Äôt they? I looked good enough, didn‚Äôt I? Or did I not look good enough? Such thoughts flew through my head in frantic waves. For dinner, I always walked over to the healthy restaurant called Silvergreen‚Äôs. There were always hot girls there, but none of them deigned to even look at me. On every one of those nights, I walked home alone, with my head down in defeat. I made no progress in school either. My geography class had no pretty girls in it, so I had no hope there. I spent a lot of time sitting in the cafeteria area, but all of the beautiful girls I saw intimidated me too much. One time, as I was walking across the huge bridge that connected the two campuses, I passed by a girl I thought was pretty and said ‚ÄúHi‚Äù as we neared each other. She kept on walking and didn‚Äôt even have the grace to respond to me. How dare she! That foul bitch. I felt so humiliated that I went to one of the school bathrooms, locked myself in a toilet stall, and cried for an hour. On one of my very last days as a teenager, as I was sitting at my usual place at the food court outside Domino‚Äôs, I saw a sight that shattered my heart to pieces. A tall, blonde, jock-type guy walked into one of the restaurants, and at his side was one of the sexiest girls I had ever seen. She too was tall and blonde. They were both taller than me, and they kissed each other passionately.

NaN,"would be much more convenient. On the first day at the new place, I took a long stroll around the nearby areas. Of course, those areas weren‚Äôt unfamiliar to me, as I had walked around there many times during father‚Äôs week. But this was the first time I went on a long walk since my breakdown, and it made me feel more confident. I met up with Philip Bloeser after not seeing him for two years. The last time I saw him was during the summer I turned 16. My mother dropped me off at this house, and I wasn‚Äôt surprised to find that he was still the exact same person; mature, reserved, a little awkward, and prone to random bouts of hyper energy. Jeffrey was also there, and he was still as wild and boisterous as ever, though he had changed a lot in appearance, no longer being the little kid I was so used to seeing him as. Philip already had his driver‚Äôs license, so the two of us went out in his car to meet Addison Altendorf, who had just moved back to the U.S. and was living with his mother in an apartment in Malibu. Philip and Addison have always been very close friends with each other, and the two of them go everywhere together. I hadn‚Äôt seen Addison since Topanga Elementary. At first glance, I didn‚Äôt know what to make of him. It was like meeting a whole new person. He had changed tremendously. With his mustache and hairstyle, he looked older than he was, cultivating a refined and sophisticated personality and wearing an elegant blazer coat. As I spent time with Addison that day, I started to enjoy talking to him about politics and the world. He was very intelligent and more informed than other people our age. I bought my first Lottery ticket when I went out shopping with my mother one day. We stopped at Ralph‚Äôs where I noticed the Lottery machine. I didn‚Äôt know anything about the Lottery, so I asked my mother about it. She told me how it works and taught me how to buy a ticket. Each ticket provides a very small chance of winning millions of dollars, and the jackpot could rise to the hundreds of millions. I couldn‚Äôt believe it. I didn‚Äôt know such a thing existed! After buying my ticket, I felt thrilled with the prospect of having a chance to become a multi-millionaire. That ticket, of course, didn‚Äôt win. And neither would any of the tickets I buy after it, but they would give me hope. I never thought nor cared about money before I turned 18, because I was still living like a child, with my parents handling the money and giving me the things I needed. However, the more older I grew, the more I realized how important money was, and the more obsessed I would become about getting rich. This obsession, which was barely taking root at the time, sparked a long relationship the Lottery that would only end in disappointment and",Elliot Rodger,1,1,511,17.03,15.85,76.91,13.89,8.22,0.59,8.81,0,3.72,2.54,0,7.83,12.92,2.54,2.74,2.15,0.39,0.59,0.59,0.39,0,0.2,7.05,1.37,2.35,2.15,0.2,0.98,1.17,2.15,0.98,0.59,0.59,8.41,1.57,4.31,0.2,1.17,0.98,5.48,10.37,3.91,0.2,2.74,0.59,0.2,7.24,2.94,1.76,1.76,0.2,0.39,1.37,0.78,0.78,0,0,0,2.15,0,0,0,0.2,0.2,0,0,0,0.2,0,0,0.39,14.68,5.87,6.07,0,0.2,0,0.2,0.2,0,2.15,0,0,0

NaN,"insisted on bringing me and Georgia, and my mother was probably looking forward to having two months without children to look after. The decision was made, the plans were set. They already had a plane ticket ready for me. I was going to Morocco. I bet they all knew I would protest against going, which is why they told me last minute. The last day of mother‚Äôs week was the day before we would depart. Mother took me and my sister to a barbeque at the house of her friends Alan and Rebecca. I was very sad for the whole day. I didn‚Äôt do anything at the barbeque except swing on their swing in misery. When we got home I played WoW for the very last time. I took advantage of the few hours I had left on it. My mother allowed me to stay up until midnight playing. I acquired a very nice piece of armor for my character. I didn‚Äôt want to leave it. When we arrived at father‚Äôs house the next day, I heard even more upsetting news. Father had to work for the first few weeks of summer, so he would joining us in the middle of the trip. It was only Soumaya taking us to Morocco! I always hated traveling with Soumaya. She made everything so difficult. Baby Jazz will be coming along with us, of course, and the stress of looking after a whelping baby while traveling will put Soumaya in a bad mood. I was not happy at all. As I expected, the journey there was a disaster. Baby Jazz cried a lot during the trip, and Soumaya wasn‚Äôt at her best of moods. We didn‚Äôt take First Class, and we had to make three stops; once in Michigan, again in Paris, and yet again in Casablanca, before taking a small plane to Tangier. It was a miserable journey, the complete opposite of the great time I had a year ago on the trip to Malaysia. We took a taxi to Khadija‚Äôs house right after we arrived. Khadija went home to Morocco on a different plane a few days before us, and she was already settled in. After unpacking at Khadija‚Äôs house, we walked to Soumaya‚Äôs father‚Äôs huge house where I met Ayman again. I remembered playing with Ayman on my last trip to Morocco... He grew up a lot since then. To my dismay, he was taller and stronger than me, despite being two years younger. I was always short and physically weak... that‚Äôs how it‚Äôs been all my life. We instantly became friends again after catching up a little, and I played hide-and- seek tag with him and his two younger brothers. I disliked having to be in Morocco for the whole summer, but I tried to make the best of it. Ayman made the time I spent there more fun. We often went out by ourselves to explore the city of Tangier. Ayman knew where everything was, and Soumaya trusted him to show me around. Georgia sometimes came with us.

NaN,"While we were eating, some high school kids walked in. James saw them first, and right when he saw them he said the words ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre fucked‚Äù. James knew I would have trouble with them. They were popular boys who had a flock of pretty girls with them. One of them sat down with two of the girls, putting his leg up on another chair with a cocky smirk on his face. I was livid with rage, and I wanted to pour my drink all over his head. James knew exactly what I was planning to do; we had been through similar incidents before. He made a lot of effort to try to dissuade me from acting on my anger, pointing out that there was a security guard nearby. I did the only other thing I could do; I packed up my dinner and left the restaurant, fleeing in defeat and shame. James soon followed, and we decided to finish our meal at his house. A dark and ominous aura clouded over our friendship that day. When the two of us got back to James‚Äôs house, I was still seething with rage. I didn‚Äôt understand why James wasn‚Äôt angry like me. The sight that we just witnessed was horrible to watch. To see another male be successful with females is torture for males like us who have no success with females. I was so angry that I told James of all of the acts of revenge I wanted to exact on those popular boys. I told him my desire to flay them alive, to strip the skins off their flesh and make them scream in agony as punishment for living a better life than me. James became deeply disturbed by my anger. I wished that he wasn‚Äôt disturbed. I wished he could be a friend that felt the same way about the world that I did. But he wasn‚Äôt that kind of person. He was a weakling. Once I had calmed down, the two of us had a long conversation in his room, and I ended up crying in front of him as I explained how hopeless I felt about life. Soon after that, I left his house, never to return there again. He will never invite me over after that incident, and our friendship will slowly fade to dust. During the last few days that I had to endure living with those barbaric housemates, I often walked out to Isla Vista hoping that I could meet a girl and take her home with me. I wanted to prove to them all that girls liked me, to see the look on their faces when they see a girl by my side. But of course, I had nothing to prove because girls didn‚Äôt like me.

NaN,"since all those recommending by-pass surgery were not surgeons themselves, I requested an appointment with a cardiac surgeon to discuss possible by-pass. I had such an appointment in November of 1998 with surgeon C. Pelletier at the Montreal Heart Institute. He told me that two arteries - Circumflex and Marginal were non-operable, while two others LAD and Diagonal were operable. He did not explain why, and he refused to discuss the option of angioplasty. A funny thing happened in 2000: I got an opinion of yet another cardiac surgeon Teijiera (Sherbrooke). He also did not recommend bypass surgery though for reasons totally opposite to those of Pelletier. According to Teijiera, Circumflex and Marginal were operable, while the other 2 were not. There was one specialist from BC, who also agreed to do angioplasty. Jailers wanted me dead, so they refused to bring me to British Columbia for angioplasty, though some of my colleagues and relatives were prepared to pay all the related expenses. Based on false statements of Quebec medical Mafiosi, jailers declared that I was getting the best treatment available and that all I needed was available in Quebec. I decided to check once again our judiciary. I filed several motions in Federal Court explaining that my life was in danger, that my heart was deteriorating and that I needed to be transported to British Columbia for angioplasty. Judge of Federal Court McGillis has declared me vexatious pleader and has forbidden me to file any action in Federal Court. I moved to Quebec Superior Court. I filed an action for damages against jail doctor Corbin and a motion asking court to order jailers to bring me to BC for an angioplasty. My action was dismissed even without hearing and judge of Superior Court Rolland has declared me also a vexatious pleader and now I was forbidden to file any action in Superior Court. Jailers knew that shooting in Concordia took place because I felt my life to be in danger and that the courts were corrupt and would not protect my life. Now they created exactly the same situation: my life was again in danger and both Federal and Superior Court judges demonstrated themselves as totally corrupt. Jailers hoped that they once again would be able to provoke me into a violent reaction. They failed: I never even raised my voice at anyone; I never begged for my life, but I demanded treatment and I filed numerous complaints. My next step was to file complaints against jail doctors and nurses with their respective Discipline Committee. I was not going to let them kill me quietly. One such complaint was considered against jail doctor Corbin and the Discipline Committee has decided that my complaint was totally without merit, that I was getting the best treatment possible. Of course, Corbin found 2 other doctors to testify as experts that this indeed was the case. Mafiosi are one family, supporting each other in any crime. In the meantime, my heart continued to deteriorate. Quebec doctors were ready to help government to kill me,",Valery Fabrikant,1,1,510,18.21,29.41,66.86,10.59,7.84,0.2,8.04,0,2.35,1.96,0.39,4.12,13.33,2.16,4.9,2.35,0.2,1.57,2.55,0,1.18,0.2,5.1,1.18,1.96,1.37,0.78,1.96,1.96,1.18,0,0.98,0.2,6.67,2.94,2.75,0.2,0.39,0,2.94,7.45,2.16,0.59,0.59,0.2,0,7.45,3.14,1.96,1.37,0,0.59,0.78,0.39,0.2,0,0,0.2,0.59,0.98,0,0.98,1.18,1.18,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,10.39,5.29,3.14,0.59,0.2,0,0,0.78,0,0,0.39,0,0

Children are savages, and they're gonna grow up to be douchebaggy parasites anyways. They should be exterminated from an early age. Obviously, not all children; not all people are inherintely evil and parasitic in nature. Anyone who is a benevolent or intelligent person deserves a chance at life. However, who should be the judge for who will live or die? All the nerds are too uptight to ever carry this out, so now we got stuck with the bush presidency and they are the enbodiment of stupidity. This obeezy presidency is just bush 2.0, so I doubt the MASTER's plan of UNITY and PURIFICATION will ever come to fruition. As for euthanasia, life is horrible. Just because the majority of people can get laid and have everything handed to them and live in heaven, doesn't mean 100% of people will. Even in the first world, there's so much injustice. Like people living past age 30 still as virgins with little friends. I'm sure a lot of them are friendly, hell that's why its called a Nice guy.

NaN,"me feel so inferior and worthless and small. I glared at them with intense hatred as I sat by myself in my lonely misery. I could never have a girl like that. The sight was burned into my memory, and it caused a scar that will haunt me forever. When they walked away, I followed them in my car for a few minutes, and when they entered a less inhabited area I opened my window and splashed my iced tea all over them. It was all I could do at the time, but at least it was something. At least I made some effort to fight back against the injustice. I felt sick with hatred that night. The hatred boiled inside me with burning vitriol. My summer session ended with no positive effect on my life. After I completed my final exam, on which I received the grade of a B, I drove back to my hometown feeling defeated. Shortly after, my 20th birthday finally came. Soumaya and Jazz were away in Morocco for the summer, so father met up with me, my mother, and my sister at an upscale restaurant in Encino. My parents didn‚Äôt show any concern for how miserable I felt about being a twenty-year-old virgin. They treated it as if it was any normal birthday. They didn‚Äôt seem to understand the gravity of the situation, which annoyed me immensely. The restaurant had an ‚Äúall-you-can eat‚Äù buffet system, and I greatly stuffed myself that night. Delicious food was the only vice I was able to enjoy, since I was deprived of sex. I had a very fast metabolism, so I could eat as much as I wanted without getting fat. I suppose that was one advantage in my rather disadvantageous life. When I got back to my mother‚Äôs apartment, she let me have a bottle of wine, and I truly drank my fill. ‚ÄúEverything‚Äôs better with some wine in the belly.‚Äù I spent the rest of the night pondering over what was in store for me at that point in life. I was no longer a teenager, and I‚Äôll never be able to experience having sex as a teenager. My teenage years were completely denied to me by the cruelness of women. The only way I could make up for it was if I could have an extraordinary sex life in my twenties. I would have to have a profoundly amazing decade in my twenties to compensate for all the misery I experienced in my teens. If I fail to do that, then I have nothing to live for. Sadly, I will only experience the opposite in my early twenties, and it will destroy me. 20 Years Old I stayed in my hometown for a week. One of my birthday presents was a gift card to Nordstrom. I spent it on a couple of new polo shirts that made me feel a little more confident. Buying new clothes would always give me a temporary boost of confidence, and I practiced it as if it was a drug.

NaN,"for great things. If other people could do it, why not me? It was my destiny, my whole purpose on this world. For the next week or so, I spent time meditating in my room, trying to come up with ways to get rich. I could either invent something, start a great business idea, or go back to my original idea I had of writing an epic fantasy story that could be made into a movie. That reminded me of the reason why I gave up on that idea in the first place... the amount of time it would take to achieve success from such a prospect. I was so desperate and I needed to do something right there and then. It was a matter of life and death. If I couldn‚Äôt make it, then I had nothing to live for. After a lot of deep thinking, I couldn‚Äôt come up with anything. Was I doomed to fail at everything? I began to feel hopeless, until I saw the current jackpot for the Megemillions Lottery. It was rising very high in the month of March. I had saved up a lot of money at the time, so I had enough to spare on lottery tickets, so long as I didn‚Äôt go under $5000 dollars, which I wanted to keep as my minimum amount of savings just in case of an emergency, or in case I would have to carry out the Day of Retribution. As it so happened, I had well over $6000 saved up at the time, from all of the allowance, Christmas money, and birthday money that my parents and grandmothers had been sending me. For the first time since moving to Santa Barbara, I began to take a serious interest in playing the Lottery again. I believed that it was destiny for me to win the Megamillions Lottery, particularly this very jackpot. People win the lottery every single month, so why not me? I was meant to live a life of significance and extravagance. I was meant to win this jackpot. It was destiny. For the first few drawings I played, I spent $50 to $100 on tickets, but to my profound frustration I still didn‚Äôt win, and the jackpot kept rising. This only increased my enthusiasm. I started to picture a whole new, perfect life for myself after I won. I imagined buying a beautiful, opulent mansion with an extravagant view, and acquiring a collection of supercars which I would use specifically to attract beautiful girls into my life. I planned to go back to college once I had bolstered myself with all this wealth, and lord myself over all the other students there, finally fulfilling my dream of being the coolest and most popular kid at school. As I sat meditating in my room, I imagined the ecstasy I would feel as scores of beautiful girls look at me with admiration as I drive up to college in a Lamborghini. Such an experience would make up for everything. I had to win this jackpot.

NaN,"in my life. I felt very small, weak, and above all, worthless. I cried by myself at school every day. The very last day of Ninth Grade was the worst. I was having P.E. at the gym, and one of my obnoxious classmates named Jesse was bragging about having sex with his girlfriend. I defiantly told him that I didn‚Äôt believe him, so he played a voice recording of what sounded like him and his girlfriend having sex. I could hear a girl saying his name over and over again while she panted franticly. He grinned at me smugly. I felt so inferior to him, and I hated him. It was at that moment that I was called to the office. When I got there, my mother was waiting for me to take me home. I cried heavily as I told her about what happened earlier. That was the last day I ever set foot in Crespi Carmelite High School. Crespi was finished. I thought I could finally relax. Little did I know that the worst was yet to come. My parents shocked me with very horrible news. They were planning on sending me to Taft High School. Taft had five times as many students as Crespi, it was a public school, it had girls in it, and it had a bad reputation. I had never been so scared in my entire life. How could they do this to me, after knowing what I went through at Crespi? Taft High School would eat me alive and spit me out. I felt so betrayed by my parents. On top of that, they told me I had to go to summer school at Taft very soon. I failed a few classes at Crespi and I had to make up for them. The summer was supposed to be a time of peace and relaxation. This was turning out to be the worst summer of my life. I went with my parents to the Taft Orientation event, and it was a horrific experience. I felt so dismayed at how large the school was, and how intimidating all of the tall students were. I even begged my parents to send me back to Crespi, because I knew Taft would be much worse. I had a foul time at summer school. I remember how I used to hate it when my parents made me go to summer camp. Summer camp was like heaven compared to summer school at Taft. I got lost on the first day. I was so terrified that I hid in the hallways during break time. I spent my time at summer school gruelingly waiting to go home so I could feel safe playing WoW. My 15th Birthday was in the midst of this summer school term. I was so miserable during this period that I didn‚Äôt even give much thought to it. It was so uneventful that I barely remember anything about it.

NaN,"way I could attain any sort of wealth at my age. I had no talents, so it was impossible for me to become a professional actor, musician, or athlete; and those were usually the ways that young people acquired such money. I could invent something, or start a business just like Mark Zuckerberg did with Facebook, but the chances of me achieving such a thing were the same chances I had of winning the lottery anyway. I didn‚Äôt even have the skills of a computer programmer. After reading this book, I wanted to believe that there was some sort of supernatural power that I could harness to change reality as I saw fit. For the months of June and July, I took frequent walks around Girsh Park in Goleta, dreaming and visualizing about winning the lottery. I affirmed that once the jackpot rose to over $100 million, I would buy a ticket and that ticket would be the winner. For all of the months of summer, people kept winning the lottery, and the jackpot kept resetting, but I was so desperate that I still clung to my faith that I would soon win. On one of the days in July, when I was roaming around Girsh Park, a group of popular college kids arrived to play kickball in the fields. They all looked like typical fraternity jocks, tall and muscular. The kind of guys I‚Äôve hated and envied all my life. With them came a flock of beautiful blonde girls, and they looked like they were having so much fun playing together. One of the girls did a handstand in the grass, and her sexy bare stomach showed as her shirt hung down. All of the girls were scantily clad. Rage boiled inside me as I watched those people who thought they were better than me enjoying their pleasurable little lives together. The rage was so intense that I couldn‚Äôt take it. I was insulted too much. I couldn‚Äôt leave them without getting some form of revenge, so I drove to the nearby K-mart, bought a super-soaker, filled it up with orange juice that I bought at the same store, and drove back to the park. They were still there, having the time of their lives, and I wanted to ruin it for them. I wanted to ruin their fun just like they ruined mine, as they would never accept me among them. I screamed at them with rage as I sprayed them with my super soaker. When the boys started to yell and chase after me, I quickly got into my car and drove away. I was giddy with ecstatic, hate-fueled excitement. I wished I could spray boiling oil at the foul beasts. They deserved to die horrible, painful deaths just for the crime of enjoying a better life than me. I drove to a secluded are of the parking lot at the Camino Real Marketplace nearby, my heart beating rapidly. After I had calmed down, I was overcome with the worry and fear that I would get in trouble",Elliot Rodger,1,1,511,18.93,16.05,77.69,14.09,9.39,0,9.39,0,3.72,1.17,0.2,7.83,14.29,0.98,7.63,4.5,0.59,1.57,3.13,0.59,1.17,0,5.68,0,0.78,3.33,0,2.74,1.17,1.37,1.17,0,0.2,6.07,0.2,3.72,0,0,1.76,3.91,8.22,2.94,0.2,2.35,0.59,0.39,6.26,3.72,1.57,3.13,0.59,0.59,1.76,0.78,0,0.39,0.2,0.2,0.98,0.59,0.2,0.39,0.98,0.59,0.2,0,0.2,0,0,0,0.78,12.52,5.09,5.68,0,0.2,0,0,0.59,0,0.78,0,0.2,0
NaN,"describes my first day of Tenth Grade at Taft High School. It was a toxic nightmare. Every single second of it was agony. I continued to beg my parents to not make me go, but it was to no avail. My father drove me there, and I didn‚Äôt want to get out of his car. He almost had to drag me out. I somehow found the will to put one foot in front of the other and walk towards that awful, ugly front building. The first week of Taft was living hell. I was bullied several times, even though I didn‚Äôt know anyone there. After being so used to wearing a polo shirt with khaki pants as a school uniform at private schools, I continued to dress like that even after leaving Crespi. I didn‚Äôt give any thought to how nerdy I looked. I was too withdrawn, like a turtle tucked into his shell. I was still in the process of going through puberty at the time, so I still looked and sounded like a ten-year-old. Such a persona attracted zero attention from girls, of course, but it did attract bullies like moths to a flame. I was completely and utterly alone. No one knew me or extended a hand to help me. I was an innocent, scared little boy trapped in a jungle full of malicious predators, and I was shown no mercy. Some boys randomly pushed me against the lockers as they walked past me in the hall. One boy who was tall and had blonde hair called me a ‚Äúloser‚Äù, right in front of his girlfriends. Yes, he had girls with him. Pretty girls. And they didn‚Äôt seem to mind that he was such an evil bastard. In fact, I bet they liked him for it. This is how girls are, and I was starting to realize it. This was what truly opened my eyes to how brutal the world is. The most meanest and depraved of men come out on top, and women flock to these men. Their evil acts are rewarded by women; while the good, decent men are laughed at. It is sick, twisted, and wrong in every way. I hated the girls even more than the bullies because of this. The sheer cruelty of the world around me was so intense that I will never recover from the mental scars. Any experience I ever had before never traumatized me as much as this. I couldn‚Äôt do it anymore. On the morning before the second week of Taft started, I broke down and cried in front of my mother, begging her not to make me go to that horrible place. I was so scared that I felt physically sick. I continued crying in the car on the way there, and my mother gave in. Instead of taking me to school, we went to the caf√© at Gelson‚Äôs in Calabasas where we had a big talk. I tried to explain how much I was suffering there. She just could not take me to school after that.",Elliot Rodger,1,1,511,13.45,12.92,78.67,13.7,8.81,0.39,9.2,0,2.74,2.74,0.2,6.46,15.07,1.76,4.7,1.17,0.39,0.2,3.52,0.39,1.17,1.17,4.7,1.17,1.37,0.98,0,2.35,0.98,1.37,0.59,0.59,0.2,8.81,1.57,3.33,0.2,0.78,2.54,3.91,8.81,4.89,0.39,3.52,0.98,0.2,6.26,3.52,1.76,2.15,1.37,0,0.78,0.2,0.2,0,0,0,0.2,0.39,0.39,0,0.98,0.78,0,0,0.2,0.2,0.39,0,0.78,14.09,7.44,4.5,0,0.2,0,0,0.39,0.39,1.17,0,0,0

It was after eleven and dark as most stormy night's are, rain hammered down on the town relentlessly accompanied by it's usual acquaintances thunder and lightening. It's dull barren street's were completely void of anything living, all the shop's had closed for the night and everyone was in their warm bed's dreaming simple dreams. The shadowy figure stood on the outskirt's of the town's eastern border looking from side to side making sure it was clear, the black storm poncho kept his black jumpsuit and tactical gear safe from the rain. He tilted the cap of his black battle helmet upwards so that he could see better, seeing the coast was clear he shifted his M-16 to his right hand and brought up his flashlight pointing it down the opposite direction of the road flicking it off and on twice. In the distance through the falling rain a pair of headlight's flicked on after seeing his signal, the man put his flash light away and took the M-16 into both arm's once again as the truck slowly started to drive forward. The truck came to a rustic stopped near the town's morgue, a one story tall concrete monstrosity with a freshly mowed lawn with lush green grass looking almost fake. From the passengers side another man jumped out dressed in the same manner as the signaler had been. The looming military figure removed his talk box from his tactical belt and pressed down the talk button, speaking a single word. """"Mask's.""""

He punched in a four digit code on the keypad attached to the barrel and with a loud pop the top opened releasing a plume of yellow smoke, quickly he moved to the front of the truck jumping into the passenger's side.

NaN,"on the black carpet. As we were lining up for our walk on the black carpet, some dumb bitch of a security guard had the audacity to question ‚Äúwho the hell are these people‚Äù. This made me so enraged that I almost said ‚Äúwe are people who are more important than you, you ugly cunt‚Äù, but Soumaya‚Äôs publicist calmly informed her of our invitation. We then proceeded to walk across the long black carpet as cameras flashed at us from one side, and a crowd of pathetic fans who reminded me of sheep cheered from the other side. I felt extremely gratified at walking on the black carpet with father and Soumaya, and I cockily smiled at all of the stupid fans who had to remain on the side, rubbing it right in their faces. There were some actors and celebrities on the carpet with us, and the paparazzi yelled at me a few times to get out of the way as they were taking pictures of some cunt actress. I discreetly gave those paparazzi pigs my middle finger. Elliot Rodger will not move aside for a stupid, good-for-nothing, over-glorified actress, whoever the fuck she was. I didn‚Äôt see. We walked through all the chaos until we finally reached the theatre where the movie was being screened, called the Nokia Theatre. It was one of the biggest theatres I had ever seen, able to see hundreds of people. At the entrance, father and I greeted Jack Ross, the son of Gary Ross. He was a spoiled brat of a sixteen year old, and to my embarrassment he stood taller than me. I immediately hated him on sight. He was living the life I should be living, if only my father had become as successful a director as Gary Ross. I equally hated his repugnant friends, who ended up sitting in front of me and partially blocking my view for the entire movie. Throughout the whole film, I had to fight the urge not to splash my drink all over the little shitheads in a vehement rage. They spoiled it for me, and it was quite a good movie too. The movie was entertaining, but my favorite part of this premiere was the after party. Yes, we were invited to the after party, where only the most important guests could attend. I felt so special as I handed my VIP tickets to the guards outside, gaining admittance. The party was extravagant, with buffet tables set up in every corner serving exquisite delicacies. I excitedly went from plate to plate, helping myself to all of the food. Father and Soumaya went off to socialize with Gary Ross and his entourage of producers.

NaN,"a lot of fun. We all slept in one room, so it was like having one big sleepover. One day we went on a trip to a museum, where I had an argument with Soumaya. She shouted at me in front of George and threatened to punish me. This was so embarrassing that I fell into a miserable mood for the rest of the day. I always loved traveling, but I learned that traveling with Soumaya just ruins the whole experience. And this wouldn‚Äôt be the last time I would be forced to travel with Soumaya either, to my utmost dismay. The trip lasted three weeks in length, the perfect length of time for a vacation, in my opinion. I quite enjoyed it, if I don‚Äôt count the times Soumaya ruined it. It felt nice to be back home after a long, cultural vacation. At father‚Äôs house, my nanny Tracy got into an argument with father, and she was forced to leave. I was sad to see her go. She was always pleasant and fun to be around. Once Tracy left, Georgia and I would no longer have any nannies. We were getting too old for it. I wasn‚Äôt a little child anymore... having nannies became a thing of the past. From now on, if father and Soumaya had to go out to a dinner party, they would just hire a baby-sitter to look after us, and soon I would be old enough to stay by myself in the house. I got a haircut, and this time I decided not to bleach my hair blonde. The black hair always grew out anyway, so the full-blonde look only lasted for a couple of weeks. Having blonde hair seemed to have lost its spark, so I just didn‚Äôt bother with it anymore. The summer was pleasant and relaxing, but it quickly came to an end. The time for Middle School had come. My fear of this day haunted the back of my mind all summer. I was enrolled at Pinecrest Middle School for Sixth Grade. I had mixed feelings about going to this school because I didn‚Äôt like my experience there during kindergarten. Father said it‚Äôs the best option for me, because it was a small private school. I didn‚Äôt want to go to a large school like Hale Middle School... that would have been too overwhelming for me. On the first day, I was shaking with anxiety and fear. I didn‚Äôt know what to expect. Transitioning to Middle School was a big deal for me, even more so than starting elementary school. I was much older and I cared more about what people thought of me. I was no longer an innocent little child who didn‚Äôt have to worry. I had to worry about a lot of things, and oh, did I worry! It was a whole new school full of people I didn‚Äôt know. They all previously went to elementary school together, so most of them already knew each other. That made me even more nervous.

NaN,"give me a respite from all the pain society has dealt to me, just like our old visits to Jack‚Äôs beach house in Malibu. Before we left for England, we attended the annual Christmas party at the Lemelson‚Äôs. I had recently bought a flashy new shirt from Armani Exchange that made me feel particularly fabulous, so I decided to wear it for the party. I loved admiring how awesome I looked in the mirror as I wore it. Wearing flashy new clothes made me feel like a new person. I found it to be a very efficient way to boost my confidence. When I entered the party, I felt gratified when Sue Lemelson, Rob‚Äôs ex-wife, complimented me on how good I looked. My mother pointed out that it was unusual for Sue to compliment anyone, so I must have made a good impression. James was at the party, of course. He didn‚Äôt act outwardly cold toward me this time, but there was still a distance between us. During the course of the event, I had my fill of multiple glasses of wine as I casually chatted with James about my insights and life problems. We interacted as if we were still friends, but I could tell that things were very different between us. The friendship that we have had for so long was dying. When I said goodbye to him that night, it was the last time I ever saw him. After having a quick Christmas celebration at father‚Äôs house, I took off for England with my mother and sister. We flew Business Class on Virgin Atlantic, and since they followed the laws of the U.K., I was allowed to drink alcohol on the flight. I took delight in sipping the wine that was served while I enjoyed the relaxing journey. The last time I had been on an airplane since then was the disastrous trip to Morocco when I was seventeen, and this made for a pleasant contrast. When we landed in England I felt the sense of wonder that came with being in another country. I hadn‚Äôt been to my home country of England for almost a decade, and I couldn‚Äôt believe I was there once again. The decision to go on the trip came so quickly. We stayed at a very nice hotel in the town of Colchester, near where my relatives on my mother‚Äôs side live, including my grandma Ah Mah. After we unpacked all of our belongings, we went to their house for dinner. I hadn‚Äôt seen those relatives since our trip to Malaysia. It felt peculiar to see them all again. They were exactly the same as I remembered. It was very heartwarming to see that grandma Ah Mah had baked her delicious peanut cookies that I loved so much as a child; she had them ready and waiting for me. We visited them again on Christmas Day. They prepared an exquisite lunch, and afterward we exchanged our gifts. I got a bit drunk on that day, as it was the only thing I could",Elliot Rodger,1,1,512,17.07,17.97,77.54,16.6,8.98,3.52,12.5,0,2.34,0.78,0,7.42,14.65,0.39,4.69,4.3,0.78,0.78,0.39,0,0,0,4.88,1.17,2.15,1.37,0.2,0.59,1.76,3.32,1.17,0.59,1.37,10.55,0.98,6.05,0.39,1.76,0.39,5.66,10.74,3.13,0.2,3.52,1.56,0.2,3.71,3.13,1.76,0.59,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.98,0.98,0,0,0,0.2,0.2,0,0.2,1.95,0.2,0.59,1.17,0,0,0,0,0.39,12.5,6.05,4.3,0,0.2,0,0,0.2,0,1.76,0,0,0

During one week at father‚Äôs after the New Year, father had to leave for his work. For that week it was just me, my sister, and Max in the house. The three of us had a lot of fun together. Max took us to Universal Studios. Father allowed him to drive the big Lexus, for which I was a bit jealous. The last time I was at the Universal Studios amusement park was when I just moved to America. Mother took us to the Universal city walk a couple of times, but never the amusement park. I went on all of the rides, including the infamous Jurassic Park ride that I was rejected from going on when I was a child. When father came back, we talked to him about our time at Universal Studios. He suggested that we all go to Six Flags. The four of us set out for it the next day. Six Flags was the biggest amusement park I‚Äôve ever been to. I was awed by all the gigantic roller coaster rides. Max, my father, and even my little sister were all eager to tackle the largest roller coasters. I was the only one who was scared out of my mind. Max talked me into it, so I nervously gave all of the rides a try, and ended up having some fun. To my chagrin, my father decided to take up motorcycle riding. He pulled up to the house one day in a roaring Harley Davidson, and I was completely baffled. I suppose it was due to some mid-life crisis he was going through. A motorcycle... Really? Alex Bubenheim got him into it. He and Alex would then ride their motorcycles all the time. He kept insisting that he take me on the motorcycle whenever we went out, instead of going in the car. This would be too embarrassing for me, and I adamantly refused to ever go on the motorcycle. I went with mother to the red carpet premiere of Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull. This was my fourth premiere. Going to premieres were always an uplifting experience for me. The movie was quite a disappointment, however, and I much preferred the classic Indiana Jones films. The next day, I told some of my teachers that I went to this premiere, and they were very shocked. I bet I was the first kid at that school who has done such prestigious things. Soumaya and Jazz returned from Morocco. I was happy to see my baby brother again, but not so happy to see Soumaya. Things were a lot better at father‚Äôs house when she was gone. Soon after she came back, we started getting into various arguments again, which embarrassed me in front of Max. In the Spring, something horrible happened that will haunt me forever.

Nearby Holigin Hospital, last occupied rescue station Riggs bit into Private Bates's fried arm. It had only been a month and the rescue station's occupants had already resorted to cannibalism. The food ration's were devoured within the first four week's of the crisis. Many people had died of starvation, dehidration, and malnutrition in the hospital, they were burned in the furnace before someone got the great idea of feasting on human flesh.Private Bates was the only sane soldier in the rescue station before his former comrades turned on him and stabbed him to death,they fried bit's of him with what little wine they had and feasted on his cooked flesh. The hospital was the largest in the state, the size of four football fields across and seven in length. It stood seven storys and even had it's own sleeping quarters for nurses and doctors who had to work long shifts. It sat at the edge of the large city wich had become a necropolis. The walking dead had turned it into a mass graveyard wich you were lucky to survive an hour in. The hospital itself was occupied by more than three thousand survivors.Most had broken off into groups and moved on to different part's of the hospital living like wild tribes.Crime was rampant in the seven storys of death.Murder,rape and other types of crimes occured almost daily. At times it seemed the city was more safe than the innards of the hospital. The group of twelve soldiers sat in a circle hunched around a flaming metal pan wich held more chunks of the human flesh their aching stomaches cried for. The men faught over every speck of greas and microscopic chunk of meat that came from the pan like wild savages,cavemen even. They were sick, they didnt have conciousnesses anymore. They were souless. Their eye's seemed black as they staired off into nothingness. They were carbon copies of the living dead wich threw themselves at the hospitals chainlink fences trying to get in,they were two and the same except these guy's had pulses and blood pumping through their veins. They had once been honorable marines who protected the hospital and encouraged morality.Now they were bottomfeeders, wild and dirty.A female cadett had once been with them, but the men had no will power and she had been continuously raped.She was alive only a weak after the men started using her. They found her dead,still tied to the pipeing on the wall.Naked and brused. Bleeding from her brutal 'sessions. 'She died from starvation and loss of blood. She became somthing of a dish after the men decided that this was the only option for survival.But survival for them soon became habbit,and they found themselves eating human flesh not just for survival,but for pleasure.

NaN,"he originally said he would, so if I had indeed went forth with my plans, I would have had to kill my father, which I wouldn‚Äôt be mentally prepared for. I hastily decided to postpone it to Saturday, May 24th, 2014. I would definitely be fully recovered from my cold by then. This will also give me a few more weeks of life, and more time to prepare. A few days earlier, I felt so ready to finally strike back at women and humanity, with all my rage and hatred. I was profoundly eager to do it! But for some strange reason, having a few more weeks of life made me feel relieved. I took in a deep breath and relaxed. Coupled with my hate-fueled eagerness to carry out my act of revenge, there was also an extreme sense of fear inside me. Part of me still didn‚Äôt want to do it. It will mean my death, and I have always been afraid of death. I didn‚Äôt want to be in Isla Vista on April 26th, the day I previously planned on carrying out my plans. Hearing all of my enemies partying and having a good time on the day I was supposed to kill them all would be too much to bear. I immediately called my mother and asked her if I can stay at her house for the whole weekend, exaggerating my illness so that she would let me. While there, I visited the doctor to ask about the condition of my cold, and spent the weekend in deep, peaceful contemplation. Upon my return to Santa Barbara, I assured to myself that this was it. May 24th, 2014 was the final date. There is no postponing it anymore, no backing out. If I don‚Äôt do this, then I only have a future filled with more loneliness and rejection ahead of me, devoid of sex, love, and enjoyment. I have to do it. It‚Äôs the only thing I can do. May 24th, is the absolute last weekend in the Spring semester in which I can carry out this plan efficiently. After May 24th, the Spring semester at SBCC will end, and all of the SBCC students will go back to their hometowns, which means less enemies to kill in Isla Vista. Sure, UCSB would still be in session, but I want to kill both UCSB and SBCC students. The Day of Retribution is my sole purpose on this world, and I am ready. After only a week passed since I uploaded those videos on Youtube, I heard a knock on my apartment door. I opened it to see about seven police officers asking for me. As soon as I saw those cops, the biggest fear I had ever felt in my life overcame me. I had the striking and devastating fear that someone had somehow discovered what I was planning to do, and reported me for it.

2016-05-20,"It's been about a month since the last entry, save 3 days. I'm currently cooking up some dinner while I type this but noone gives a damn. A lot has happened in this month, so far... One of my good friends, whom I've barely known for less than a year, yet has risen to be one of my bros, challenged me to a debate. He is of a religion I won't specify (it's not islam, dont worry) but was challenging my lack of faith in any paranormal / spiritual shit. So he told me to do a mental ritual. I did, and I asked for what I want (Success with my endeavors, and meeting girls). I had a 10/10 luck streak that lasted a week. In that time... 5 of the ladies I knew, sent me nudes (each one of them) and got comfortable sexting with me. One young woman I know IRL, will be visiting me after this semester's out, and will be making my life the best it's been since 2008. I became an admin of a very notable site. After thinking about a specific reservation and the tragedy that befell them (early in may, a similar tragedy effected the rez Im from), I found some random Native American dude on omegle. I went on there to troll but instead had a good conversation with this dude. He talked to me about how 6 of his friends chose to end it. He is from the poorest rez in america yet made it to college. Kudos to him. I talked to a very famous dude (hint: 2011, retaliation against some faggy little bully) for 40 minutes. I went on to skype some chick but she went to bed; instead, the famous dude was on for once. He allowed people to add him on skype, so I did; I thought it was an impostor but it was actually him. I brought up the dude I met yesterday, and the famous dude told me how he talked 13 people out of becoming an hero. Good job man. I made one of the girls I know into a sort of girlfriend, the first time I had one since 2009.

NaN,"unpopular, widely disliked, and viewed as the weirdest kid in the school. I had to act weird in order to gain attention. I was tired of being the invisible shy kid. Infamy is better than total obscurity. The teasing I received was bittersweet. It felt horrible to be teased and bullied... it caused me a lot of pain and anger... but at the same time I got a kick out of getting so much attention. It felt good to be confident enough to pick fights with the popular skateboarder kids. It was either that, or continue to be ignored by everyone like I was in Sixth and Seventh Grade. I never knew how to gain positive attention, only negative. My experience during Middle School really darkened my view of the world, and it would only get darker from then on, as I suffered more and more. The way I was treated by girls at this time, especially by that evil bitch Monette Moio, sparked an intense fear of girls. The funny part of this is that I had a secret crush on Monette. She was the first girl I ever had a crush on, and I never admitted it to anyone. To be teased and ridiculed by the girl I had a crush on wounded me deeply. The world that I grew up thinking was bright and blissful was all over. I was living in a depraved world, and I didn‚Äôt want to accept it. I didn‚Äôt want to give any thought to it. That is why I immersed myself entirely into my online games like World of Warcraft. I felt safe there. I was so obsessed with playing WoW that I never gave much serious thought to the fact that I would have to go to High School soon. As the end of middle school neared, the prospect started to loom over me more and more. At one moment I pictured what my life in high school would be like, based on how things have been for me in middle school. It was not a bright picture. I didn‚Äôt want to have to deal with the cruelty of girls in high school, and I imagined that it would be much worse than anything I‚Äôve ever experienced. I begged my parents to send me to Crespi Carmelite High School, a catholic all-boys school. Father took me there for a tour, and it didn‚Äôt look so bad. It was a very prestigious private school. At least I wouldn‚Äôt have to deal with any fear of girls there. We submitted an application. A few weeks later I received the news that I had been accepted to Crespi. Eighth Grade Graduation was a nightmare. Everyone was required to go up on stage and speak to the whole audience. We had to say our name, and tell everyone what school we were planning on going to.

NaN,"couldn‚Äôt fathom how I had to endure such a painful life. On that same night, I looked at the Powerball again, and saw that the jackpot had risen to over $100 million. This prompted me to drive to Arizona again, in another desperate attempt to become instantly wealthy so that I could attract beautiful girls and live the life I want. After all of the rejection and mistreatment I‚Äôve experienced at the hands of women, I knew that becoming wealthy was the only way I could become worthy of them, and so my obsession with becoming wealthy at a young age came back in full force for the first few months of 2013. By the month of April, I had driven to Arizona three more times, making a total of four trips to Arizona in my lifetime, just to buy lottery tickets out of intense desperation, believing it to be my only hope of attaining the life I desire, the life I know I‚Äôm worthy of. I kept dreaming of the life I would have once I won; the beautiful blonde girlfriend, the luxurious mansion with a magnificent view, all of the exotic cars I would drive to impress girls. It gave me hope. It gave me something to live for. That hope was shattered after each attempt. None of the tickets I bought on those trips fulfilled my dreams. The reason I kept going, even after I didn‚Äôt win, was because I truly believed I was supposed to win. I wanted to believe it because I wanted something to live for. I needed to have hope. I knew that if I lost all of my hope, I would have nothing to live for but revenge. Any chance of having a happy life would be doomed. At the end of March, when I checked my last set of tickets that I had bought from my last trip to Arizona, and saw that I didn‚Äôt win, any hope I had of becoming wealthy at a young age was finally and indefinitely shattered. It fully dawned on me that the life I had envisioned for myself would never come to pass. The children I would have in the future with a beautiful blonde girlfriend ceased to exist, as if they were murdered. There won‚Äôt be any beautiful blonde girlfriend for me now. No girl would be my girlfriend unless I had great wealth... I learned that from my life of being rejected. I was doomed to a life of lonely virginity. In April, the Powerball lottery was introduced in the state of California, so if I ever wanted to play it again I would no longer have to drive to Arizona. However, I was so shaken by not winning in the last few months that I gave up on it for a while, but eventually I would have episodes of little surges of hope in which I‚Äôd buy a few tickets, just to have something to hope for as I endure the last few months of my torturous life.

I spent a few more days at mother‚Äôs with my walking cast and cane before she made me go back to Santa Barbara, telling me I can return to visit in two weeks. I made my ominous drive back to Santa Barbara, and as I drove I thought about all of the injustices I had to face in the last two years I had spent there. Injustices that had never been set right. Now was the time to set them right. Now was the time for Retribution. When I got back to my apartment, I saw that my housemates Chris and Jon had moved out. A pity, as they were the most pleasant housemates I could have hoped for. I feared what my new ones would be like, and I was told they would be coming in a few weeks. I had the place to myself for that period, which suited me well. I refused to leave my room at all until I was able to at least lose my walking cast. I spent the time doing the same thing I did at mother‚Äôs house. I watched a lot of movies, and sat around contemplating my future. Upon my visit home, I went to see my orthopedist for one last time, and he told me I can finally walk without any cast around my leg, though I would need the cane for a few more weeks. I was content with this, as I didn‚Äôt mind the cane that much. It had a peculiar elegance about it. On that same weekend, I met up with Philip and Addison. We had been planning to meet during the summer, but I had to postpone it because of my terrible injury. I took them out in my father‚Äôs Mercedes SUV, and we went on another one of our adventures around Los Angeles. First, we went to an exquisite Japanese restaurant on Sunset Boulevard in West Hollywood. I was thankful I didn‚Äôt see any young couples my age there, most of them were older than us. Afterwards, we went to Griffith Park Observatory, under Philip‚Äôs suggestion. Going there brought back memories, both good and bad. It was ever a tradition for the three of us to go there, as we had been so many times. The place provided an expansive view of the city of L.A. At night it was absolutely exquisite. The Griffith Park Observatory was truly a wondrous place to admire the beauty of the world... but the whole experience was ruined, of course, by the sight of so many young couples kissing there, right under the stars. Those boys must have been in heaven, to experience such a place with their beautiful girlfriends. Seeing all of those young couples at Griffith Park filled me with rage for the rest of the night.

NaN,"skateboarding, playing World of Warcraft together as teenagers, all of our walks through the Palisades town center... He was a big part of my life. And now he was gone, faded away into memory. I didn‚Äôt have any friends left anymore. No friends in the entire world. I didn‚Äôt want to see Philip and Addison after I cried in front of them at the Getty museum. I was completely and utterly alone, in the darkest pit of despair. And in that pit I withered in agony. My deep depression lasted well into the summer. My life stayed stagnant and miserable, and my hatred towards everyone, especially women, for depriving me of a happy life only grew stronger. I questioned myself over and over about what was going to happen to me now. I didn‚Äôt want it to resort to having to exact ultimate vengeance. I didn‚Äôt want to die. I wanted something to live for. There had to be a way for me to become wealthy. I continued to see it was the only way I would ever have a beautiful girlfriend and lose my virginity. My ultimate dream was to experience the pleasures of love and sex with girls once I become rich enough to be worthy of them, and then I would settle down with a beautiful girlfriend and have beautiful children with her, whom I would raise up to live a much better life than the one I‚Äôve had to suffer through. That would be the most satisfying vengeance against all those young people who thought they were better than me. If I could show them that I lived such a life, my purpose on this world would be complete. To see the look on all of their faces once I‚Äôve risen above them... I couldn‚Äôt imagine anything sweeter. I so happened to come across a book called the Power of Your Subconscious Mind, by Joseph Murphy. This book would fill me with hope for the next few months. It was very similar to The Secret, the book I read over a year ago, and it had the same effect on me. It gave an even more in-depth view on the law of attraction. A year previously, I had given up on believing in such a concept, but when I read through this book thoroughly, I desperately convinced myself to give it a try. I wanted to believe the theory could work. I needed something to live for. I began to visualize myself winning the lottery. I did this all throughout the month of June. After continuous analyzing and contemplation, I concluded that winning the lottery was the only way I could become wealthy at a young age, and thus it was the only way to enjoy the rest of my youth. If I didn‚Äôt have a satisfying youth, I would be bitter and miserable for the rest of my life, but of course that would never happen. If it came to that, then I would have to carry out the Day of Retribution.

NaN,"joking about how lame Pokemon players were, and I decided it was time to quit. I talked to James about this. He was still interested in Pokemon, so I gave him my Charizard card as a gift, and as an act of my resignation from the game. Pokemon gave me some really happy and memorable experiences, but it was time to move on. I then started to notice that all of the cool kids were interested in skateboarding. I had never even ridden on a skateboard before, but if I wanted to be cool, I had to become a skateboarder. I expressed this to my parents, and my father was glad that I was showing an interest in an active sport. He took me to the store Val Surf on Ventura Boulevard to buy me a new skateboard, and I was fascinated by all of the different choices. I settled for a red Val Surf branded Skateboard, and they took it down from the wall and built it for me. I was thrilled to have this new skateboard and the possible chance it gave me to be a cool kid. It was time to start practicing. I found it very hard to even ride on it in the beginning, and I spent many hours outside trying to get the hang of it. And that was that, I was now a skateboarder, though not yet good enough to reveal myself as one to the kids at school. This was the start of an obsession to copy everything the supposed ‚Äúcool kids‚Äù were doing. Part 3 The Last Period of Contentment Age 9-13 Fourth grade ended, and once the summer started, I took a vow to mold myself into the coolest kid I could possibly be by the time Fifth grade began.

NaN,"left for Santa Barbara, I reunited with Philip and Addison after a very long period of not seeing them. The three of us met up at the Calabasas Commons, and then we went in Philip‚Äôs car to Malibu for a few adventures. We ended up settling down at Starbucks and had a few insightful conversations. Addison had changed and matured tremendously, and he was no longer associating with the popular Malibu high school kids. This didn‚Äôt change my resentment towards him, and I kept confronting him the whole time about the insulting way he treated me over a year ago. After a lot of debating, we agreed to resolve our conflict with each other. This didn‚Äôt mean I forgot all of the slights he dealt to me in the past, however. I never forget. I never forgive. One day I‚Äôll show him how superior I am. On the day after I saw Philip and Addison, I went over to James‚Äôs house. I hadn‚Äôt been there for ages, and the two of us relived our traditional walks around the Palisades town center, just like old times. It felt strange and nostalgic to experience it after so long, especially after going through so many changes in Santa Barbara. I told James about my turmoil of being a twenty-year-old virgin, and my desperate hope that things will get better once I start my Autumn semester at my new college. I talked about all the beautiful blonde girls I saw walking around my college, and my deep wish that I will have one day have one as a girlfriend. James sympathized with me greatly, for he was also going through similar troubles in life. He seemed glad that I was finally taking some steps to bring changes to my life. I drove back to Santa Barbara in a slightly better mood than I was in when I left it. I had a month until the new semester started, and I could use that time to prepare and recuperate. My new housemates were meant to move into the second bedroom of my apartment on August 5th. I had an anxious feeling of anticipation for what they will be like. August 5th came quickly, and I prepared myself to be in a pleasant mood to meet them. Their names were Ryan and Angel, and to my dismay they were of Hispanic race. In addition, the two of them were already friends with each other, which meant that they could possibly gang up against me if any conflicts were to arise. They also seemed like rowdy, low-class types. My first impression of them soured me, but I tried to be pleasant and not show it. The two of them acted cordial to me on the first day, but after observing them for a bit, I had a bad feeling that they would be trouble to live with... And they were to be my housemates for a whole year! When I was alone in my room, I panicked to myself at how dire a situation this was.

I've never wrote this much so fast ever. its kind of cool, but weird at the same time. because none of it makes any sense and none of it flows, thats ok though, I guess thats the point of the assignment. now I'm wondering about what experiments I will be able to do. seems like fun. I can't wait. I'm excited because my check card came in the mail today. now tomorrow I have to go to the co-op and buy the solutions manual for calculus, because the TA doesn't know how to teach, and she's a aloser. I hope I'm typing everything fine. I'm trying to type with my eyes closed. lets open my eyes now and see how things went. hey, pretty good!!!  anyways, I hope fauzia brings me that paper in class tomorrow about selling your notes and all, it'll help out, I mean, every little bit counts!!! well I'm almost done know. its been 12 mins. so not too much to go. this kind of sucks, meghan and angela are coming on friday, in the evening, and I'm leaving for back to dallas in the afternoon. hopefully I can stop by baylor on the way back from dallas and check out the dorm room. we'll see what happens. man, now that I'm thinking about angela, gloria did the same stuff to me that she did, but gloria went farther. oh well, she looks a lot better than angela anyways, so I guess its better that way. ok, enough of that. I'm just really hoping we can do that kind of stuff later on also. ok, enough, for reals this time. man, my contacts are sticking, and they're causing my eyes to shut. oh well, hopefully when I'm done with this, the clothes will be done. that way I can get em out, and go to sleep, I havent had good sleep since I moved here. I got to wake up all early. and besides that I'm always awake, never sleeping. but I guess missing sleep last night was worth it, after what happened. hehehehehe. oh well, ill miss sleep for that any night of the week. I don't care about sleep when that is concerned. I was all sore last night from working out too, but I'm not going to let that stop me. hellz nooooo!!!!!  I'm still a bit sore, because we started working out on saturday. its starting to wear off, so I'm getting used to working out, I just hope we stick to working out everyday, because I need it. but I kind of like that sore feeling, because atleast then you know you're doing something, and that something is improving. man, this is loooonnnnnggg, but its ok, I doubt anybody will even read it. I guess its just like a completion grade. man its hard to have your words and all agree with me. don't just play with me like that. well actually, you can play with me anyway you",stream of consciousness,0,1,509,11.31,11,80.55,15.32,9.04,0.98,10.02,1.18,0.79,2.16,1.18,3.54,11.2,0.39,5.11,3.93,0.39,1.18,1.18,0,0.39,0.39,11.2,1.96,1.77,2.55,0.59,6.48,1.38,2.16,1.57,0,0.59,4.52,0.2,3.34,0,0,0.79,6.09,3.54,13.95,1.96,3.14,0.98,0.2,6.29,5.89,1.57,2.95,0.98,1.18,1.57,0.79,0.39,0.39,0,0,0.98,0,0,0,2.95,1.38,0,0,1.57,0,0.39,0,0.79,23.18,8.06,8.25,0,0,0,2.16,0.2,0,4.52,0,0,0

Ok I have about six minutes left,  this is actually pretty cool, getting to know how my mind works and all. I already realize how many different topics my mind changes to in just 20 short minutes. I wish my mind did not wander off so many times, because that's really not good for my grades. Like sometimes in class, I will sit there thinking of my boyfriend instead of listening. But, then I go back to paying attention until I start wondering how my dog is doing all alone at home. Well, actually, I haven't thought about my dog during a class yet, but it could happen. Besides, I wanted to bring her up in some way in this little writing experiment, and that was the best way that I could think of. Anyway, as I was saying, I really hope that my dog does not die early since it is do lonely right now. My mom says she just sits on the staircase waiting for somebody to come home- that would be me or my brother. Ok, now I am thinking about me brother, who is the sweetest guy on earth. I hope that he is doing Ok right now. I thought that now that we live in the same city and all, we would actually get to see each other more, but we are so busy, I really don't get to see him until the weekends. Anyway, I don't know what I would do if he wasn't here to help me out. For example, I wouldn't have even known about this big computer lab. well, I am sure that I would have found out somehow, but I didn't have to find out myself. I mean, I don't want to be all dependent on him or anything, but I learn a lot from him, and I learn a lot on my own, too. Well, I think that my twenty minutes are up now.

You can't always rely on others in life so if I get a good education I can get a good job to support myself. This has made me realize that when you do something do it for yourself and not for anyone else and don't stop what you are doing just for someone else. Because that someone else might not always be there. This has led me to conclude that you shouldn't care what others think because if it makes you happy than go for it as long as it doesn't harm anyone else.

NaN,"""""""well I guess I am just supposed to start writing. Well I will start by telling this computer about my day. Today I went to class, well first I was supposed to wake up at 5:45 am but instead I pushed my snooze button one too many times and ended up sleeping until 6:45,my bus leaves at 7:00. So I missed my bus, the third time this school year, I just can't seem to get it together. But anyways I arrived to my class 25 minutes late, and since it was my third time late to this class it was slightly embarrassing, especially since the only two doors into the classroom are right where the teacher is teaching. So I slowly made my entrance and went and sat in the back of the class, and for once I didn't fall asleep! AMAZING! I then decided to do my chemistry homework that I thought was due today but its really not due till Thursday. So I wasted my time off doing homework that wasn't even due, not like I understood much of it anyways. Well so then I was out of school for the day! My boyfriend, John, doesn't get out of class until 1:15 and it was only 12:30 so I decided to go to Barnes and Nobles and finish reading an interesting book I had started a week ago. Its called """"""""A Boy Called It"""""""" its actually a very upsetting book because its about this boy who endured horrible child abuse for the better part of his childhood. His mother was basically insane. She played horrible games with him, like making him burn his own arm over the stove, making him eat his brother's dirty diaper, and starving him to death, not to mention beating him to a pulp everyday. And his family just stood by and watched him take it. What kind of father could watch his son be abused like that and not do anything? That just makes me sick. Well so anyways I almost finished the book when John called and picked me up so we could hang out. So we watched Hannibal. Oh what a creepy movie! The grossest part was when he took the scalp off one cop and scooped out some of his brain while he was still alive. AND THEN, fed it to him! It was pretty disgusting. So after that we just kind of hung around his house doing nothing, but I love the fact that I can just do nothing with him and not be bored. But oh the drama that our relationship has caused with our friends! I don't even want to get into it. HMMM I'm thinking about going downstairs and getting myself another cookie, I'm addicted! I'm a chocoholic! But seriously I need to start working out, or eating less or something because I'm feeling a little on the chunky side. Maybe tomorrow I will do that. Yea right, like I have the time. I'll just starve myself, naw those cookies are just too darn good!

It just bites that he showed his love and affection for me after he hears about me being with another guy. But oh well, that's life I guess. I am really glad I continued to see this other guy, regardless of what my ex had to say. I spent every day with him until the day I left. I have never met anyone that has made me laugh so much. He is amazing. The only thing I'm worried about is that I'll fall too hard and too quickly for him. I mean I did just get out of a serious relationship and I don't think I'm quite ready for another one. That's the only problem I'm having right now. The fact that he's a high school student does not bug me as it used to. But the distance might become an issue. It was an issue in a way for me and my ex, so I do feel a tad bit guilty that I'm willing to work things out with this new guy rather than my ex. But my ex did not treat me as well as this new one is treating me. But yeah, that is basically what has been on my mind like everyday while at UT. But I am definitely loving it here in Austin. I enjoy all of my professors and classes. Having two biology classes and a chemistry class, however, can be tough. In addition I am taking this psychology class, which I dropped economics for because it seems way more fun and interesting. Other than that I have my freshman seminar class, which has the topic of promoting health in multicultural populations. I just finished the reading for that class right before I started this assignment. Ah, my hands are still so cold. What do I do?!  My ears are feeling very cold too. Must I wear gloves in the summer in my DORM ROOM?!  Or my bad, it is the fall now. Same thing. Today is the day for my mile run. Ever since I moved to Austin, I have been running a mile every other day at the Gregory Gym. I absolutely love that place!  And it is so convenient because it is right next to Jester. Freshman 15 can kiss my booty because I am staying in shape!  I find that I've been working out more here than I was doing at home in the summer. I really love this lifestyle I have at UT.

I have only vomitted twice in my life and so my dream had to do with me throwing up all over the place and in my dream I was trying to wake up from the dream because I don't like throwing up. I was also thinking about all of my school work. I am very frustrated with the pre-testing website because I can never get on it. There always seems to be some sort of technical difficulty, and I don't know what to do about it and so I came up with one solution and that is to get Netscape Navigator but that also didnt work out like I had hoped. So I tried to see if there was a problem with my Internet provider so that whole thing is causing a lot of frustration for me. Well I don't like thinking about it too much because I am hoping sometime between now and September 11th my problem willl be solved. I am also overwhelmed in my spanisk 312L class which my last semester of a language and it is very difficult and I dread going to class every MWF from 12-1. As I am writing this I keep thinking about how the instructions of this assignment says not to worry about grammar but I still have to make sure that I haved spelled every word correctly not so much the punctuation but the spelling. This assignment is very fun for me. Also I am thinking about the conversation my roommates and I had last night about God right after we were discussing God in class on Monday. We had a two or so hour conversation about death and God after I had stated that the ONE subject that I do not like talking about is death. So ofcourse we talk about death and then we go on to have a deep conversation which is something I enjoy doing from time to time just to see what other people feel about certain topics. I am also constantly thinking about guys that I used to know in high school and the one or two that are a year younger than me that I still talk to and that have at one point or another had an attraction to but don't know what will come of it meaning whether or not I will stay friends with the two boys as time goes on. I am also thinking about what is going on on the television show that is on in my room. It has to do with sexual harassment and it is the guy accusing the woman of sexual harassment at a Dominos Pizza Company. And he won the landmark case. It is funny because the comedy show that was on prior to the present show had to do with the same issue.

She is so much fun, she reminds me of Jill Clower but I seriously think that she is so much nicer than Jill Clower could have ever been. I really don't want to do this stupid assignment. I don't want to do this anymore. I could totally stop and come back and no one would ever know, but I am sure that there is some kind of point or something and I wonder if anyone is really going to ever read this I wonder how George Magel is doing. That boy never really changed since 6th grade. There are two ways to write 6th on this computer. I had so much fun walking on sixth street the other night with Tim. It would be really cool if he would call me. I really was looking forward to coming to college and making a best friend that would be in my wedding and move to New York with me for no reason, and do fun things like shop for fruit and flowers and watch old movies. I don't think that I have found my real best friend yet. I wonder if people really think that you only have one mate out there waiting for you. I wonder if that is true. No one could ever prove that. The only person who knows things like that is God. My Dad is really close to God. I really do think that the closer you are to God the better your life is. You may not be famous, or always have the cutest clothes, but you will know what and who you love and what is important to you, and those few, simple things that are important will work out perfectly, they way God wants. Trust in the Lord with all your heart and things will never go wrong. I wish that I could sing. That would be so cool. I love to dance also, and I can't wait to try out for pom squad. I love being in front of everyone. I wonder how Lizzie learned to work computers.

NaN,"The first thought that comes to my mind right now is about two of my little sisters. They are ages 4 and 7. I can't help but worry about them atleast five times a day. They live with my mother who is not exactly the world's best role model. I feel bad saying this, but it is true. She is not very strict, and it is easy to get away with the things that she says not to do. When I used to live with her I took advantage of this. I made terrible grades, lied all the time, sometimes for no apparant reason, and I did not take care of myself. Thank God I got out of that situation. I moved in with my father and my former stepmother. They got me out of my bad habits for the most part and without them I would never be sitting at this computer doing an assignment for a college course. Even after my dad and stepmom got divorced I still lived with her, I am so thankful that she has been here for me all these years. Getting back to my sisters, I am afraid that they will fall into the same habits I did and they are not as lucky as I was to have my stepmom. I can see them in the future missing out on so many opportunities because my mom won't keep them in line. I hope that I can be a positive influence on them, but it will be hard because I only get to see them about once a month. They are beautiful children with great personalities. Unfortunately Regina the 7 year old has already had troubles in school. I know this is not my mother's fault, because it seems as though she has some type of learning disability, but at the same time my mother doesn't spend any extra time working with her. Andrea the 4 year old is absolutely brilliant, I don't think she will have any problems in school unless she falls into the same pattern I did of lying and not doing her school work. I would never want to see my sisters move in with there dad though, because I am afraid that would make my mother feel as though she were a failure. I cannot imagine having three children and then having all of them raised elsewhere. I know she loves all three of us, and we are her life, and I love my mother very much also, but I just wish she would make more of an effort to make better lives for them. It would be a big help if she would just grow up a little bit, her mother still runs her life, and she cannot make decisions by herself.

Even if there isn't a constant stream of people through the room here, like at UT, I'm entertained and happy.

I don't know how I'm going to get through a semester, much less a year, or even 4 years. I don't have depression (at least I don't think so), I think it's just the pressures of school. Everyone says it gets better after the first semester. I hope that happens. On another topic. Ty has downloaded some great guitar music. I love it. I'm going to burn a copy before I go back to Austin. He's working on his homework right now. I never realized how much I would miss him, even though we're only an hour and a half away. He's the only person who I trust enough to be myself around. And he loves me anyways, which is really the part I can't believe. I can't wait until next year when he's at UT with me. I should call my mom sometime. I've been home once, for a few hours, but really I haven't talked to my parents all that much. I guess that's okay, and honestly, I don't miss them much. They got me to a point of being pretty self-sufficient awhile back I think. Sometimes though, it sucks, because i want help, but they won't give it to me. I guess it has made me a stronger person. Ty wants me to help him with his physics homework. I had to remind him that I'm a business major, and that I nearly failed physics in high school. He makes me laugh. He'll make a wonderful engineer someday. So gifted in math and science. I wish I had his math logic. Unfortunately for me, I don't. Calculus is going to KILL me this semester. There are pretty posters on Ty's walls. There's a gorgeous one of saturn and 6 of it's moons. I don't remember, does saturn have more than 6 moons? I really want a Dr. Pepper. I haven't had any caffiene today because there isn't any in this apartment. I guess I'm kind of getting a headache from the lack of caffiene, but I'll live.

The combination of the fan and air conditioner noise is driving me crazy. It is like the drone of a prop-plane. My computer is constantly checking for viruses and is always making little """"""""engine"""""""" noises while I am typing. My room mate has a very odd way of typing. As I am doing this assignment, I am hearing myself talk the words as I type. I am sure that I have always done this, however, until now I have not noticed it. I believe that I just heard thunder. we could use the rain. I can't believe that we had a pop test in spanish today. I have a knot in my stomach. I know that I did poorly on it. I have a great spanish resource. my 501 verbs book. My monitor also makes a noise that sounds like I would imagine electical energy to sound. I want to go home this weekend. I miss my brother. I am going to bring him to Austin sometime to hang out with me and see the sights of UT. What time is it?  I wonder if my package has arrived in the mail room, yet?  I wonder what my dad thinks of all of my difficulties with the percussion ensemble here?  I would like to retreat to Lake Tahoe and bask in the glory of the crystal clear water and the Sierra Nevadas. That was a very random thought. All of the intricacies of the human brain are very amazing. If my cardiothoracic surgery bid does not work out, maybe neurosurgery could be an option. I have never had a class quite like psychology 301. I like the fact that it is web based. If I happen to miss a class, it is relatively easy to track down what was discussed. And even if the web doesn't have the information, the study sessions should cover the material again. I wish that I would have attended the first study session. I wish that I hadn't signed up for the molecular biology honor society. my plate is full already. That is such a strange idiom. I wonder how it came about. I wonder if idiom is the correct term for that expression. I have a very nice printer. It's fast, silent, and very clean looking. I am definitely a strange guy to be admiring his Deskjet!  I had to buy a lot of books for my spanish class. It has turned out to be my hardest class. I do not think that I am going to take any more spanish after this semester.

NaN,"I am sitting here in my dorm room trying to organize my time for the rest of the day and night. I have a lot of reading to catch up on. I have trouble sitting down reading for a long period of time. I would rather sit in a lecture and listen to a professor. That is, if he/she is interesting. I want to read and understand my psychology book, but for some reason I haven't been able to concentrate on it. I feel like I am behind in this class for some reason. My mom graduated with a degree in psychology. She loved it. My biology class is my favorite. My professor is interesting and the book is interesting to me too. I wish I knew what I wanted to be. I have so many different ideas and I can't decide right now. I talked to my mom today and she suggested marine biology because she knew I used to be interested in that. She also suggested being a doctor. I don't know if I can go to school for 8 more years though. Four more years seems like a lot to me. But I know I will do it. I just feel weird right now I guess because I am just starting. I am 3 and a half hours away from home. I like it here but I miss it there. I always have a lot on my mind and I think that is why it has been hard to concentrate on reading lately. Eight months ago, 2 days before Christmas, my boyfriend of 3 years, Phillip, was killed in a car accident. I almost didn't come to UT because he was supposed to follow me here and live in Austin too so we could be together. I thought about that a lot the first week I was here. It is just really hard. This is one of the reasons I am being in my reading for philosophy and psychology. I've been doing homework all week making up for last week. When it comes to school work I love being ahead. Which is why I am doing this writing assignment a week in advance. I'm hoping that I will feel better when I finish this and I will be able to read 2 chapters and comprehend it. When I stay ahead in school I always feel so much better. I like to read the sections before lectures rather than after. I am the type of person that takes on big load and I tend to get stressed out easy that way. I decided that when I came here I was strictly going to concentrate on school. In high school I had a full schedule of ap classes, a job, and participated in athletics.

NaN,"Well right now I only have a couple things on my mind that don't seem to leave my head all day long. The two big ones are this guy I saw again and had a great time with and my school work. These two things are really bugging me. First off with school I am worried about what type of grades I am going to get,whether or not I am going to keep myself on top of my works, whether or not I will have the will power to actually tell people no I can't do this because I have to study, how are the first test in all my classes going to go, is there going to be an overwhelming amount of information on my exams that I am going to have to knwo, how much harder are these tests going to be then my test I had in high school, how exactly do I study for a college test when there is so much information to know, how specific are the questions going to be on the test and are they going to be tricky questions. These are a lot of the questions that run through my head and I am not usually a person who freaks out about stuff in my life. I guess another reason I am so worried is because I would really like to get into the business school if possible, but everyone tells me how hard it is and that I am going to have to make a 4. 0 and then even then I possible could not get in if I don't have the right connections or know the right people. So on that note, I am starting to try to figure out exactly what am I going to do with my life or major in if I don't get into the business school. I guess there are other things that I am interested in, but it would just make life a lot easier if I got in. The other major thing on my mind is this guy a saw again and hung out with the whole weekend. He is such an extremely nice guy, smart, gorgeous, and so much fun to be around and totally sweet. I haven't been treated like he treated me in a long time. He seemed totally into me too, but I don't know. I guess the whole self-conscious thing is coming into effect of whether he felt as strongly about me as I did about him. He seemed like it though. He also just happens to go to Texas A&M too. Which makes things even more confusing.

When people were still learning their multiplication tables. Science fiction. Fantasy. Anything that made life a little more exciting and unpredictable. And I wanted to escape. Straight A's, top of all my classes, and only a pat on the back. Still not good enough, because no one would share it. They wanted to play outside, go to the bayou, ride bikes, play in puddles, watch a movie, go to a party, raise hell. I just wanted to be alone. With my books. My imagination.

NaN,"I have decided to get a head start on my writing assignments so here I am writing about my thoughts. I am completely amazed that I can do this assignment on the internet. I mean five years ago who ever would have thought that you would be typing and submitting assignments off of the internet. Sometimes I wonder if the internet is just getting way to big. I hear people say that they think that it is going to get so big it will just collapse in on itself. Personally I do not completely understand what they mean by that. But it is kind of scary that any kid can go on the internet and get as much information about guns and hate groups as they want. I guess, like most things in life, the internet has its good points and its bad points. This writing assignment is my first writing assignment in college! It is so weird that I am now a college student. I still feel like I don't completely belong here. I have met a lot of cool people, but it definately does not feel like home. For some reason I have not come to realization yet that I am here for like seven more months. I still have no idea what I want to study. My major right now is microbiology. I was planning on becoming a doctor, but I'm not completely sure. I think that is what I want to be but I am interested in so many things. I'm taking an architecture class this semester just to see if I'll like that. I am good at math and science so I considered engineering. The only problem with engineering is that I really don't understand what an engineer does! I love science so I guess the medical field is good for me. Lately though I have been thinking of studying to become a veternarian. It involves science and animals and I absolutely love animals. The problem with deciding on a major is that I have no clue what each major entails. I guess I will have to go and research all the different majors I have been thinking of. This past june I went to this program called National Youth Leadership Forum on Medicine in Boston. I did not really want to go but I decided it would help me to make up my mind on becoming a doctor. It did not really do that, but it was an interesting experience. We went to Harvard Medical School and talked to med students there. That was interesting because I was expecting like a bunch of Einsteins sitting there just naming off different formulas and equations. Actually they were just normal people who did not seem any different from myself. Also at the Forum we went on hospital tours and some kids (I wasn't one of the lucky ones) got to shadow a doctor for a day. My friend Harris was able to actually watch open heart surgery.

Maybe that is why I still have not put together a regular schedule. I haven't really been here for a full week. Well, this will be my first full week in college.

I just need to find that close best friends that I haven't quit found yet. And I really can't wait for next summer its going to be a blast. I think God is putting me there for a purpose but what it is I'm not sure. I just can't wait. I just hope by that time I'll know what it is I'm supposed to be doing here and be totally happy. Its like I feel sometimes I'm putting on a show. It's weird. I hate that I'm kind of in a group who went to high school together. It makes it really hard to fit in. I just need to find my group but hopefully I have now with joining Hyde Park. It'll be all good. Its weird I think that with all the moving I've done it changes things here because I'm used to being on my own and finding new people but it seems so far everyone does stuff with people they already knew or stuff. It's weird. I can't wait though to see some of my old friends. It'll be great fun I miss them lots but",stream of consciousness,0,1,511,12.46,10.18,86.69,20.35,13.11,0.2,13.31,0,1.37,3.33,0,2.94,9.78,0.39,5.87,2.15,0.39,0.78,3.72,0.59,0.98,0.39,14.29,0.78,4.5,4.7,0.78,8.41,1.96,0.98,0.59,0.2,0.2,5.09,0.2,1.96,0.59,0,1.57,3.91,2.35,17.42,3.13,4.5,0.98,0,4.89,7.44,0.78,1.76,0.98,0.2,0.59,0.39,0,0,0.2,0.2,0,0.59,0.59,0,0.39,0.2,0.2,0,0,0,0,0,0.98,16.05,7.24,0,0,0,0.59,0,0,0.59,7.63,0,0,0

NaN,"Well here i am writing this assignment don't know exactly what to make of it but i will give it a try. College has definetly been a weird expierience so far frat life is very different than what i was used to back in my home town. My friends are acting very differently even friends i knew close in high school are pretending like the don't know me and its strange. don't get me wrong i have nothing against branching out and meeting new people but i still like to keep in touch with my friends but i can't seem to do that. Huge decisions permeate my life right now, i mean people keep telling me that the decisions i make over the next couple of years are going to affect me but it seems like the decisions i make right now affect me the most. Whether i join a christian fraternity or not its all so strange. People are often so complex and strange. I guess thats why i am a Psychology major. The mind is so complex and even today hasnt been mastered. For example how do i know if what i am typing here right now is my actual real thoughts and not something i think abuot thinking merely for this expieriement.  What is real. . if it is just electrical impluses interpreted by the brain then what is real   - Morpheus. Just thought i would throw that in there. don't get me wrong i know in my heart the foundation of my life but already in the first chapter of this book i have beef with this writer. He explains coincidences in our lives as totally unrelated and people use extra ordinary beliefs in superstition or God to explain them. I don't believe that at all how is mr Myers so sure he knows what a coincidence is anyways? Too me it seems there are too many coincidences in modern day life that they lose their   coincidentibility   and some greater power has to be in control. I willingly get up every day knowing without a doubt that The Creator of the Universe has sacrificed himself for me and i can't tell you how great a feeling taht is. Knowing that no matter what mistakes i make during the day His blood will cover me. Evolution is a big tub of crap. How can something come from nothing. . its impossible defies the system of physics? Even if one buys into the Big Bang Theory which is a load of crap where did that first star come from? SOMETHING CANNOT COME FROM NOTHING. . and the way that things are spiralling downward the farther and farther we push God out of the picture. The more we take Him out of the Pledge of Allegienace and our money the further we dig ourselves until He comes back like a   theif in night   and to be honest i can't wait.

NaN,"""""""I am thinking about the video game I just tried to order over the phone. It angers me that it is sold out. I am now thinking about this assignment. It comes to me that I would very much like to make a superb grade in all my classes. I think that perhaps I shall if I apply myself. I am glad to think that I can do well in school. My thoughts now focus around a girl in my philosophy class who has the cutest face I think I've ever seen. I am trying to figure out a way to talk to her. I think it will have to be classrelated. There are two other girls in that class that I think are attractive. The class itself is very fun as well. I have a lot of work to do this weekend. I suppose I should get straight to it when I get home from class today. Damn, I have to work out. I used to dislike working out because of the physical discomfort, but now it's merely an issue of time. Time is the one commodity I am exceedingly greedy with. I am now thinking about how to best manage my time this weekend. I am more or less caught up in this psychology class; I now have more time to work on the others. I think I will get caught up on reading in English, and then turn in my paper. I paused for a moment there in my writing. I was thinking about what it was I was going to do today in the gym. I realized it was leg day. Leg day is excruciating, but short. Oh well, I will live. My thoughts wander back to women. I would very much like to get better acquainted with all kinds of women on a casual level. I need to expand my pool of female friends. Even as we speak, a plan of action comes to mind. School makes it easy to meet new people. I simply have to turn off my shyness. I paused AGAIN in my writing. I was thinking about the study section in computer science I was about to go to today. The TA in that study section speaks very poor English. I will go because I understand the code he puts on the board enough that I am well ahead of his thinking during that hour. The other students are not so fortunate. I figure that they'll survive. The class is a breeze. It is not very challenging, unfortunately, but I am learning a bit. """"""""Easy Learning I call it.

NaN,"Writing about what I am thinking will be a new experience for me. I just got back from psychology class, so naturally I am thinking about psychology. The way I learn is that I review everything said in class in my mind for at least 30 minutes after class. Now that I am doing the writing assignment I have other things to think about. my roommate is cleaning out the refrigerator. I honestly think that she is one of the most histerical persons in the world. my other two roomates are engrosed in the television which basically means that they are compeletely useless for the next four hours (unresponsive to almost anything excep for maybe a fire in the house) maybe they will talk to my roommate that is cleaning out the frig. during a comercial. Kate, the one cleaning out the frigerator just called the two couch potatoes re and tard, that made me laugh. Trying to keep one line of thought is really hard for me. I listen to everything that goes on around me and have to have a thought about it. It makes it really dificult for me to study most of the time. I cannot study at home because I have to talk to all my roommates or listen to them being crazy or something normal (that does not happen very often around here though)  I also cannot study at libraries because I am a people watcher. I like to just sit and watch people. I learn a lot about people that I don't even know just by watching them interact with their friends, or even how they walk. I also suffer from severe migranes, which makes my life interesting when I get a really bad one. I think I have almost overcome them, but I do have one right now. all I have to say about it is AGHHHHHHHH. My mind almost automatically switches to thinking about Alexander when I have nothing else to think about. he is my best friend and I love hanging around him. he just broke up with his girlfirend and I just broke up with my boyfriend so we have a lot of crying to do around each other. my exboyfriend was really bad for me. it took me two and a half years to be able to say that outloud. I think the only reason that I went out with him, and stayed with him was because he was the first guy to acknowledge my existence. I guess I didn't have very much self esteme when I met him, but now I do, and now I realize how bad he was for me.

NaN,"I was so excited about coming to UT and I still am but alot of things just over whelm me. For example, people in Austin are not a friendly as college students at other schools. Basically im talking about the girls its all about what frat your in and bullshit like that. I am always so nervous about screwing up in class like for example Psychology I am always worried that im gunna forget to do something and I am always worried that im not taking the right notes. What it really comes down to is that im always worried about grades and wether my parents are gunna accept my grades. I always woder wether they would really take me out of school but im not gunna ever see because i won't let my self be that bad of a student. I worry alot way to much i just wish sometimes i could just say F*** it and do my own thing but i know if i do that then i will fall behind and never be able to catch up. I think one of the real reasons that im always worried is because im dislexic and i feel that sometimes that holds me back from being a great student. I nother thing that bothers me are bad room mates like my room mate now he has a 4. 0 in buisness honors and basically i thinks that he is right on everything. That really pisses me off because he has no common since and living with him has not been the best thing because i can already tell that his parents have done everything for him because he never cleans up after himself and he is always trying to blaim me for plates and food that gets left out and it is always him. I know that sounds stupid but i don't forget to put food back in the frig because i love to eat so food is important to me and i would not for get it. One thing that i don't like about living in Austin is that it is so expensive to live here. Every place on campus is between 700 and 900 dollars a month not including the electric bill, gas bill or telephone bill. I really wish the weather would get better it is so hot right now that walking to class has been killing me, i hate to sweat and i swear thati walk into class looking like i just got out of the pool. One more thing that is really bothering me is my ex-girl friend like we were only together for all of july and august and i broke up with her because she goes to tcu and i got to ut and i would not work out. But i always find myself wanting to call her and she always calls me but everytime we end up getting in a fight and and we never ever faught when we were together.

She's still dancing like a complete moron she thinks that she is a hummingbird. I think that I will party hard on Saturday night but not as hard as on last Friday.

NaN,"in college that's for sure. My budget is $500 a month and this month alone I have already spent over 800. I sure am glad that I received financial aid to make the burden of paying for college easier on my parents. They were sure proud of me when I told them about the scholarships I received. It felt good to make them proud. My brother is smart and does extremely well in school, I hope I can live up to my parents standards and continue to do well educationally in college. College sure is much different from high school. A lot more studying and my studying skills aren't nearly up to par considering I almost never did it high school. Now I know I need to study to do well in school so I am, but it just takes me forever to outline a chapter. A lot longer than it seems like it really should. I guess maybe I'm a little bit too stressed out about college. I'm sure that once I get used to it, it will be one of the best experiences of my life. But until then, it's still hell. My friends are in the living room, I told them before I started writing this not to disturb me for 30 minutes, but who knows if they will obey me. My one friend John loves to just barge into my room. I played raquetball with John and Joseph. I suck at raquetball but hey it's only my 3rd or 4th time to play it. None of us are really are that good.

NaN,"Today is Friday and I am feeling sad because my I had been hoping to see my boyfriend Justin this weekend. Actually, originally I had planned to see him next weekend because this weekend he was supposed to be going to La Grange. But then his trip to La Grange got cancelled and I was hoping that he would be able to come up and visit me. But it just wasn't going to happen in this short of notice because we had too many other things going on this weekend. But next weekend I will see him because I am driving down to Houston next Friday. I am so excited because by then it will have been three weeks since we last saw eachother. Next Sunday, September 15 is his brothers' birthday. He has two brothers, they are twins. Their names are Jack and John. They will be turning 11. This weekend I am going to buy them birthday cards. The only problem is that I'm not sure which name to put on one of the cards because now John wants to be called Hunter for no particular reason. So I want to be nice and call him by the name he wants to be called, but I also think that those kind of nicknames are dumb. By that I mean nicknames that are derived from nowhere. A nickname should contain at least some semblance of the person's actual name. But I want to be nice to his brother. I am very tired right now. I didn't get enough sleep last night, I stayed up late talking to my roommate about the most random stuff. I had planned to take a nap after my 10:00 class, but I got sidetracked, and I had that guilty feeling that I should be studying. So I went to the library and studied a little bit. And now it is 3:00 on Friday afternoon and I really have nothing to do. That has been a common theme during my two-week college experience so far: having nothing to do. My roommate is one of my best friends from high school, and all senior year we were so excited about coming to college. And I really like it here a lot, but I guess it takes awhile for things to pick up. But I have been meeting a lot of people in the dorm and some people in my classes. At first I was unbelievably homesick, it came in waves. I'd be ok for awhile, and then all of a sudden something would remind me of Justin or home or my parents or something and I'd feel like I wanted to cry. Now that things have settled into sort of a routine I feel better. And I know it just takes time. I can sort of gauge everything that happens to me during college to what happened to my brother, because when he started college he was in the same situation I am in - he was in a long distance relationship.",stream of consciousness,0,1,507,16.9,15.38,83.23,15.38,9.07,0.59,9.66,0,3.35,1.38,0.2,3.35,12.62,2.17,2.96,1.97,0,0.59,0.99,0,0.2,0.59,8.68,1.78,1.97,3.75,0.2,3.55,0.79,2.37,0.79,0.79,0.79,7.3,0.99,4.14,0.79,0.99,0.39,7.1,5.92,9.47,2.37,2.56,1.38,0.2,6.11,4.14,1.97,3.55,2.76,0.2,0.59,0.99,0.99,0,0,0,0.2,0,0,0,0.59,0.2,0,0,0.59,0,0.2,0,0.39,10.65,5.92,2.37,0.59,0,0,0,0.39,0,1.38,0,0,0

I'm not quite sure what they are doing now, but it involves a lot of bumping around. They had a picture of some female anatomy on their wipe-off board for a couple of days, but it's gone now.

I wasn't about to say anything about it to them, though. who am I to tell them what they can display outside their door?  now I hear multiple guys laughing.

I am just so worried about everything. we are fighting an awful lot lately vecause we need to learn to get adjusted to all the new things around us. why in the world is he at Rolla. He just settled there which makes me so diappointed because I want him to be happy. Not just settling someweher cause he feels like he has no other choices. And then he goes on about there not being anyone there who doesn't drink and so in order to not be alone he hads to go out with these guys  why can't he just gove it some time. He'll meet good people eventually. he just doesn't want to be alone like he was for most of high school. I can kind of understand because  he spent so much time out of hat he considered the loop. I can't really say much because all my other friends are at UT. Heck I'm even living with one of my best friends.

NaN,"At first when I came to UT I was really scared that I was not going to make any friends. Right away I met many people and made many acquaintances. I am not sure I have made any really good friends. I feel lonely many of the times even though I am constantly around different people. For me to feel good is to be loved and that is not happening. First of all, I have no family near me which removes that area of love. My best friend, Milan, is one who I can turn to. or so I thought. He seemed to have become distant from me than usual and I did not appreciate it. Actually it made me jealous because I need attention. So then I began to think that I might like him more than a friend. One of my good friends ended up telling him that I like him. It made things worse than before. But now he likes me and still wants to date other people. I think I really like him so this bugs me. I don't know what I should tell him. I think that he does not like me the way I like him. He told me he was going to come over today but he did not. He did not even bother to call and let me know that he was not going to come. He is probably out, clubbing or something. It was rude of him to not even give me a call. Situations such as these make we wonder if anyone really does care about me. I feel like some how I am always betrayed. Why is that? I wish I could be happy in my life. That is all that I ask for and wish for in my life. I feel like nothing really makes me happy. I am not saying I am always sad and my life sucks because this is not the case. I am just saying that sometimes I am sad and maybe sometimes I am content with my life. Content is not good enough for me. I want true happiness and not by myself but with another person. I am trying to find that happiness but it is way out of my reach. Why is that? Why me? I ask myself these questions all the time and ponder to myself. I think that in life I will never really be successful or anything because I get lonely really easily. I can't even go to the store by myself or to the grocery store. I need someone to go with me. Is that a bad thing? I think that it is because I am not very independent. I want to have someone with me all the time because I like the company. My best friend also tells me that I crave attention. I don't know about all that. Maybe I do though, who knows?

I feel tired right now and I would like to go to sleep, but I know I should get this writing assignment out of the way. I was talking to my brother about computers today. It was fun but hard at the same time since it was over the phone. My mind went blank for a while and I can't think of anything to write. Tomorrow is one of my best friend's birthday. I can't believe she will be one year older. She is a senior in high school right now and I bet she is stressing over college applications like I was during senior year. I hope she gets everything done in time. I remember senior year was really interesting. I had to research a lot with colleges and what I wanted to do with my life especially choosing a major. So far, education is what I want to do. I think it will be fun especially if I decide to work with elementary students. I am feeling really sleepy right now and I can feel my fingers moving more slowly than before. I miss my family. Even though I am used to being away for a month. I know I will begin to miss them so much more in the next couple of months. I hope they are doing well and everything is working out in their lives. I also miss my friends back home especially my church family. I can't believe I am actually going to say this or actually type it but I also miss my pastor. Especially his sermons. As I am here in Austin, I have been church hunting with some friends and the pastor's sermons here are just not the same.

I am absolutely exhausted. I don't like NYPD Blue. Why aren't there any good shows on when I am actually in my room and able to watch TV?  My head is starting to hurt more.

I don't know what I am going to tell her, because I don't want her to be disappointed in me. I am such a horrible person. I don't know why I am the way I am. It really hurts.

I know college is going to be more difficult than high school, but projects like this don't have any meaning to me, honestly. I am wondering what will become of me after my collegiate studies. I want to become a doctor but then again I want to be a musician too. I mean I have been playing the piano, singing, acting, speaking, directing bands, and performing for almost all of my life. I want to continue but a part of me is saying - You need to become a doctor because you love biology, anatomy, and physiology; you can be financially secure if you become a doctor! I want to tell myself don't worry about it and what happens will happen. I don't know what to write about anymore! I'm laughing at myself because whatever I am typing I am literally reading it out loud to myself as I write it. I'm thinking is that normal? Anyway, I'm now listening at the keys of the keyboard and the sound that they make, and I am amazed as just how fast I type without formal or informal training. I then think about how blessed I am to be here in college with the opportunity to follow my dreams, once I figure out which dream is possible or realistic. How do I know that my major is the right one? I mean, I am now a microbiology/pre-med ,major and I don't know if that's my fate. Should I be in the college of fine arts and the school of music attempting to become a vocalist which is my other dream for myself. I am looking at how long I have been typing. Only 13 minutes. The phone just rang and I had to answer it; I hate that happened because I was interested to find out what this paper would end up like if I would write continuously. What am I talking about? Well, anyway, I enjoy music and stage. I like volleyball and am very upset that there aren't any male teams in high school or college that are competitive with other schools. My contacts are bothering me; somehow I have the ability to blink awkwardly and move my contact around so that they feel somewhat more comfortable. well, I was just disturbed for about 15 minutes because one of my friends came over to ask how to install his Ethernet card.

I type slowly anyway so I shouldnÔøΩt have too much trouble typing for twenty minutes and producing much of a paper. I am not thinking about much at the moment except for the fact I am hungry and stressed out. The first week or two of school seemed pretty easy and then all of the sudden, yesterday it hit me. I am in college and at this point I need to get my priorities straight. I am enjoying myself too much and need to have more focus. My mind is just wondering a million miles a minute about nothing in particular. I need a job, but IÔøΩm so busy with school and stuff with my sorority, which is another story. I am not the proudest to be in a sorority. Don't get me wrong, it's a great honor and a fun time, but I don't like the whole association that comes with it. My whole life does not revolve around guys and partying and allowing myself no friends or life outside of the sorority, as many of them do. In fact, I like so many people outside my sorority and would like to get to know them better that it makes me wonder if this is a good, more importantly, healthy fit for me?  I love Austin because of it's diversity and that became one of the main factors in choosing schools between SMU and here.

I used to write daily in my journal at home, but havenÔøΩt had too much spare time to do that here, so maybe that is why I have been able to do this, and express myself so well. I enjoy so much being able to express myself on paper, which may explain why I write so much-journal, letters, poems. It helps me gain a sense of relief and since I don' express my feelings out loud too often, I need to do this daily, if not more so I can release all that I feel. I am excited about doing psychology this year because I hope to decide between the two majors I am struggling with.

He says that I don't trusthim because i don't want him to read it. I don't like loud noises, especially from things like vacuums. Jesse is vacuuming right now. I don't like it when people play music loud either. It just bothers me. I love Jesse, sometimes I just don't get what he expects from me. I am so tired. I haven't slept since I came to Austin. Thats probably because my bed is broken and no one has come to fix it yet. I'm really thirsty. I just walked back to campus from the capitol. Jesse bought me one of those glowing necklace things. September 11th makes me sad. I was is my chemisty class at Maypearl High School and the principal made an announcement for all of us to meet in the cafeteria. I didn't believe it at first. Why does Jesse always bug me. He likes to see how much he can annoy me. I love him, but I don't like to be bothered. I'm starting to get really sleepy. I don't want to go to class tomorrow.

My roommate is out with some weird guy she met on the internet. I swear she's with a new one every day. I'm afraid something bad is going to happen to her. Raquetball is fun to play.

NaN,"Right now I'm sitting in my dorm room. The TV is on and the band called   The Calling   is playing. I really like they're music, they kind of soothe my thoughts and put me at ease. Music plays an integral role in how my attitude is for a certain day or time. Many times I'll listen to something that is very hard and angry and it will put me in a bad mood, however, that rarely happens. I'm really kind of worried about my laundry at this time. I have honestly never washed any clothes, so it presents a particularly daunting task to myself. I have just realized how long 20 minutes is, and it seems a lot longer than what i figured it would be. Although this task isn't particularly challenging, it's interesting to try to think about what i'm thinking about. Many times I think the things I'm thinking of are reflected by hearing as well as sight. I've noticed this because I'm listening to music now and the song is a mellow number that is making me really relaxed. I need to make some Gatorade, because I drank all of it yesterday. Reese Witherspoon is really hot, there's a picture of her in front of me, and she is beautiful. Now there's two songs playing at the same time, and that is sort of bothering me. First of all because i like them both, second of all because it's hard to keep up with both of them. Earlier I mentioned that my laundry was bothering me, well that is really a trivial task. More precendent on my mind is making good grades in my classes. College is easy so far, however I haven't had any tests and just one quiz, in my Spanish class. I think i fared ok on that quiz, so I'm happy about that. However, I'm still very curious as to what I actually made. When i first got to Jester my allergies acted up really bad, due to the inordinate amount of dust in the room. After the first week I got acclimated to it, I guess, and now I'm doing just fine. I had an appointment at the SSB to get my allergy shots this afternoon, so I treked over there after I ate lunch. When i got there the lady informed me that she had double booked the nurse in charge of giving shots. She was paranoid that I would be mad at her, but of course I wasn't mad. It takes a lot to get me mad, and something like that is just a minor inconvenience to me. So I just went about my way. I am also happy that I got my computer problem resolved. Seether put on a great show at Ozzfest on Saturday. Their lead singer sounds a lot like Kurt Cobain, who was awesome. All of Seether's songs were really great, they impressed me. Chevelle put on a good show too, as did Lost Prophets.

Therefore I am thinking about my husband, especially because he just walked in the door of our apartment at Bridge Hollow here in Austin. I miss my father. His birthday was 9-7 and I forgot!!!!!!!  I felt like crying all day. I miss my mother too. Her birthday is coming up in February. (2-5-51)  I truly don't know my father's age. He is older than my mom I know. They divorced when I was 5. After that I guess I lost count. I was adopted  here in Austin at Marywood. I was extremely lucky, because I got the best 2 parents in the whole world!  I truly mean that. I love them. I also miss my brother. He is in the Waco Youth Center right now doing much better. He wants to start working on his career now. He had a hard time with a lot of things, but he sure is strong. He is 3 years younger than me and is learning disabled. He had a hard time in highschool, but let me tell you that when it comes to technical and architectural knowledge, talent and ability, he is awesome. This center will help him get a job at what he is good at and that he will enjoy. Well, as you can probably tell I love my family. More importantly I love God because He sent His son Jesus to die for my sins and because I accept Him, believe in Him, and in return I have given Him my life to use me for His glory. Time is up.

Now I'm already disappointed because I have this great new TV in my living room and no cable hookup to watch anything but Fox thru a lot of colored snow. So I figure I'll rent a movie, that has to get reception. But NOOOOOO, the VCR is goofed or something. It may have something to do with the tracking, but I don't have the tape anymore so I can't experiment. I'm usually very good which technical things. I knew everything about my first VCR before it came out of the box. But last Friday was definately not my day (triple low I've heard it called). But oh well, my friends liked my spaghetti and my (MOM's) sauce so that was good. Not a complete loss. Man I would hate to be the person trying to pick stuff out of this. So anyway, I have 5 minutes or so to type. I have a printer sitting next to me still in its box, and a vacuum cleaner in its box in the closet. Tell you anything about me?  Actually, I'm a pretty neat ship keeper; I do have a bit of a paperwork mess in my bedroom but the livingroom is quite presentable except of  course for a big big (like really large and at one time really heavy) TV box. But until the cable guy comes on Wed. , it'll probably stay there. I have to make sure that I can support my mother beginning this summer because I think she may need it at some point.

I'm listening ti the Lord of the Rings soundtrack right now, and my room is freezing!!  Brackenridge, even if the rooms are spacious and it's in a convient location, had the most frigid, uncomfterabel environment to live in. Half the time I walk around bundled in every layer of clothes I can find-- I feel liek an Eskimo!!  of course I wouldn't be in my room so much if things at UT were going a little better. Sorry, usually I'm not a whiner, but this past week has been extraordinarily rough. I feel like I don't know anyone, which I don't, and sometimes I 'll go through whole days on just a couple of words spoken to my room mate. A feeling of total isolation isn't exactly the easiest to deal with. I'm usually a pretty social person, actually, i just have trouble meeting the people. However, once I get to know them, I 'll open right up. Yep, I'm an oyster or something--once you get 'em open. My parents haven't called me, which is only a little troubling. I thought most parents wre supposed to hang off onto their child's every footstep as they walked out of the nest to college. My sister has called me a couple of times and actually planned a visit, which I am definitely looking foward to. So, instead of going out with friends or talking to people that care about me, I do my homework. I must be the most ahead inmy studies of any student at UT. Spanish is actually the hardest class for me right now, and probably the least interesting (which might contribute to the hardness factor). Philosophy, Poesis and Psychology are definitely tied for most interesting class of the semester award. I knew I loved English, suspected I'd enjoy the biology and problem-solving of Psychology, but I had no idea I'd find Philosophy even slightly interesting. Right now, I'm reading about the Hindu religion. I love the idea that I'm getting education!!  Psychology and Philosophy fit so well together, too. Usually I study one right after the other because of the overlap in some of the topics that the two classes discuss. While Philosophy ponders the idea of mind in a very abstract, ideal form, Psychology makes more of a direct pursuit to it's functions and how it works. It's amazing to see the two find out the same things or how a discovery in Psychology will back up a wispy thought in Philosophy. Now I'm getting really tired of writing those two class names. I read something interesting the other day that reminded me somewhat of this writing assignment.

I have to be back at 5 Sunday to try out for ransom notes, so that is a factor, Also Stephanie wanted me to visit EV free Sunday morning with her, so if I do that I will want to leave Saturday afternoon, so I am not sure, I still need to read chapters in psy, chapters 3,4 in CS, chapter 2 in psy, I need to do that today, maybe after I go run, I think I will go to Baylor tonight and come back tomorrow afternoon. And get stuff done, I need to work on that song, that reminds me I need to go get those Birkenstocks as well, anyway I want to see Blake and Lauren and the game but I don't know if I will have much time, maybe I can leave in the morning tomorrow, and skip the game, come home and do some stuff, that will give me time to go and get the shorts and sandals I have been meaning to get, then I can still go out on sat night, maybe with Jacqueline or Susan, most everyone went back to see Dave, I wish I was seeing Dave, but they sold out the first weekend they were on sale and I was not in town to get them.

NaN,"this is by far one of the most interesting assignments I have ever had to do  not the first stream of consciousness assignment, rather the first time I have ever submitted anything to an instructor via the web. this technology is absolutely amazing and exciting because it is potentially so very dangerous. it is as if no one is safe anymore. I am very hungry right now and I could really use a lunch break, but there never seems to be any time to afford that type of luxury. I am writing this in the student microcomputer facility and there are a whole lot of computers in this place, I guess they need this many to accommodate 40. 000 plus students, this sure is a big school but there are a lot of advantages that come with that. I am beginning to wonder if this class is simply a tool for all of the psychological researchers at this school. it is obvious that one of the reasons UT has one of the best research departments in the country is that they take advantage of a class that at one point or another every student at this place has to take. this provides for an enormous field from which to gather information. in its own way it is rather sneaky. however, it is not necessarily a bad thing. I am actually thinking of being a psy major. I think I may double major with a BA in music and another liberal arts degree . I sure am glad I switched out of my performance major. I just didnÔøΩt want to compromise my love of music for the narrow path I was treading. there was simply no t enough room for my own creativity to get involved. my stomach is becoming impatient with me. 20 minutes is a lot longer than it seems. it would be interesting to read different responses to this assignment because I bet that a lot of people think about a lot of different things. . in a class of five hundred it would be hard to have one general make-up. this keyboard is very stiff and rather annoying to type on . oh well. I wonder how much money is spent on computers at this school every year. I donÔøΩt want to think about it. it is strange being a sophomore in a class with so many freshmen. at least I know what to expect. I am gradually running out of things to write. this type of writing forces you to think about what you are thinking about which is a very strange concept. I think the radio show went well last night  I hope to get all of the technical kinks worked out by nest week so that we donÔøΩt look so incompetent.

Another thing I don't like about my floor here in Jester is the fighting over the washing machines. For awhile we only had one working washing machine for the entire floor. I'd have to do my laundry at like 4 in the morning just to get some of it done. Now we have three but they always seem to be busy, and no one comes to take out their clothes when they are finished washing. As if no one else needed the machines.

Sadly, I've only been here two weeks in Austin and I've already been to the Highland mall three times. Each time I really have no idea why my friends and I went. Only one time did we have something that we had to get immediately. All it was a white shirt for a party. The traffic down here gets on my nerves. I think Austin has the worst highway system in the world. How could someone construct such an awful system?  Don't they see the danger they are putting all the drivers in. I think I've nearly gotten into like ten wrecks. It's crazy. It's so hard to get around. Just simply trying to get to a Walmart is a pain. Thankfully I don't have to go that often.

NaN,"""""""I feel a bit stressed due to the fact that my first three tests are all next week. What will they be like?  Will I do well?  Or, will I enter the large classroom, with a crowd of students all cramming in the information for those last final moments before the test and freeze after spending countless hours preparing. The new environment is wonderful, however many changes come along with it. The first test of the year, the first test at college. Each exam seems to have much more bearing upon your grades than in the past. Some thoughts about how I'm going to go about studying have crossed my mind over the past few days. These hours have most likely been wasted, as I could have been studying or reading material which will be covered on my tests. However, this is not quite the way I always function. I often tend to spend too much time worrying about how I will go about doing something, rather than just doing it. Anyway, I spent a couple of hours studying today and I have figured out what time of each of my days between now and Wednesday, and how each precious moment will be spent. I'm sure it will all work out, but until these first three tests are finished, I know that some time will be spent worrying about how the final result turn out. Those are just some thoughts about school which are probably quite typical of a freshman. It's strange to come from the top, back down to a little freshman. It appears that quite a few people have decreased their level of maturity back down to a freshman in high school.

I am also thinking about how many typing errors I make as I type. I am drinking Pink Lemonade and chewing Orbit gum. I am also thinking about my boyfriend, and waiting for either an email or a phone call from Kuwait. I am very worried about him, but he reassures me everyday that he will be ok. I have to read a lot of Biology tonight. I also have to get my clothes together for tomorrow morning. Tomorrow is the start of my first full week as a college student. I don't like college to much, it is quite boring and time consuming. I would prefer to be going to college closer to home or at home, but here is where I find myself. Oh well, it's okay. I'm testing the waters and seeing how I like this place. So far so good, the football games are fun and my classes are interesting. Except for one of my Biology classes, my professor is evil. I wish that my boyfriend would call, I would really like to talk to him. I miss him so much, and I can't wait till he comes home. I have lots of pictures of my family and boyfriend in my room. They are all over, I miss them all so much. I hate being this far from them, but I have to do what I have to do. I am full from eating a giant burrito at Freebirds about an hour ago. I keep staring at my cell phone hoping someone will call me. I still have to do some Pre Calculus homework and read for Psychology too. I received one Instant Message, I wonder who it was from. Probably my little cousin who bothers me all the time. Everytime someone signs on and off the internet that annoying door sound plays. It gets on my nerves. I wish it was Saturday still, I had fun on Saturday. I am tired of typing and I want to start my reading so I can go to bed. My roommate is going to Jack n the Box, and she asked if I wanted anything, but I do not like burgers or greasy food anymore. Plus I am watching my figure and do not want to get the dreaded Freshman 15!"""""""" I just got an email but I can't read it until this is over I want to read it so bad because it might be from my boyfriend. Dang I so wish that I could check my email, with my luck it probably was my boyfriend. My music stopped and no it is silent in my room but I can hear some music from my RA's room.

Hunger, football, and the giant pre-screening survey thing that I just took. Can you believe that I finished it at 2:54, only 6 minutes left before they stopped accepting them. Man talking about some pressure. Speaking of pressure, I just thought of physics, which is kind of weird since I don't have physics this year. I do have math though. I played cards last time I was in class. We played this crazy Russian game. It was really cool. We tied in the end. ^_^ Wow, ok, so now that I typed ^_^, I thought of anime and forums since I use that on forums all the time, and it's an anime face. And now I'm thinking about how I can type without looking at the keyboard. I just moved the mouse, and that reminded me of a real mouse. Man, I make a lot of typos. Of well, did you know that I learned to type too early that I lifted my hands off the keyboard so I could type faster since, I had small hands. And so in I think 10th grade I had to fix myself, and retaught myself 10 finger typing. Cause you see this """"""""hover hands"""""""" typing caused me to look at the keyboard. The song just changed and it totaly distracted me. Speaking on Song, I met a girl named Helen Song, the first Day of Psycology and she's really cool. I like her a lot as a friend but at the same time I want to ask her out. But you know that my biggest fear (and pretty much the only one) is losing a friend. And so I have trouble asking girls out cause I'm afraid after they say no, that they don't want to be friends anymore. Why am I telling you this. Oh well, for all I know you don't read these, or you read them completely. Hehe, you know why do some people type hehe, and other haha. You told us to think about our reactions and our observations. I bet lots of people start talking about what their observing and rather than thinking, pay more attention to their random observation thoughts. I bet that produces a lot of weird data. Me, well I ask a lot of questions, and think really fast. I often find myself daydreaming. ALL THE TIME! hehe. so yeah, wow, hehe sounds like a girl to me. Not to self, refrain from saying hehe. I glanced at the clock for the first time. I wonder is that means that I'm finally bored after 8:30 minutes. But as I keep typing, huh, I thinking more about the actual act of typing.

NaN,"It amazes me that I have known about this writing assignment for a while now, and yet I wait to do it until the night before the deadline. I don't procrastinate too terribly much but sometimes I guess I do. I'm really tired. I stayed up until about three in the morning reading for my government class. Then I had to wake up at about seven. I don't even know why I woke up that early. We entered the draw for the OU football tickets and everyone I talked to said to get there early. So I wake up and drag my self down there, with only a few hours of sleep. I was pretty irritated when I found out that it was by number order, so it actually didn't matter. I must have misunderstood when they were giving the instructions. I guess it's just one of those dumb freshman things. I'm actually not as nervous as I expected to be. I came from a town of 2000, smaller than most people's high schools. Everyone told me that I was going to be sad and cry a lot. Suprisingly I haven't been upset once. Sure I miss my mom, dad, sisters, etc. but i've been pretty good. I do miss my boyfriend. He's great. That was pretty hard. I cried more when I left him than my parents. Don't really know what that means. I was just use to seeing him everyday and now I hardly get to talk to him. He's still great though. I hope it all works out okay. I know it will. What's meant to be is meant to be though. I've sort of learned the hard way that I can't decide my own fate, I've tried to change things but they still end up the way I worried they would, but they ended up okay. I guess He does know what he's doing. He's pretty good at it. Yesterday was kind of hard. The September 11th memorial service and hearing the story was sort of difficult. I got to go to New York this summer. My mom took me and my sisters for my graduation. Pretty Nice gift. She and my sisters have had it planned for over a year. It was my middle sister Leslie's idea, but then she was paniced after the attacks and almost didn't go. She was worried that she'd never see her little girls again. It was real sad, but we forced her to go. We had a wonderful time, yet a time that actually makes everything real, and put it all into perspective. It was truly amazing.   In my dorm we have a connecting bath. It's pretty nice but has an awkward smell. It took my roomate and I a very long time to figure it out and it's not jusr the regular bathroom smell. We've been watching our suitemates and figured it out. One of them drinks coffee and has been washing her dishes in the bathroom.

Now I'm thinking about how I can possibilly type my thoughts for this amount of time with out taking a break for some snacks and whatnot. Today has felt like the longest day that I can remember and I can't figure out why. When I was in my math class at 11 in the morning I for some reason it felt to me as if it was 5 in the evening. Now I am listening to the tv in the background and amthinking about how much I disagree with the news man. What is going to be typed by me in 5 minutes from now is flooding me with curiosity. I hope that this week goes by much faster then it is right now. I can't wait until Texas plays North Carolina this Saturday. Horns football is one of the top three reasons why I applied to The University of Texas and I am very glad that I got in. Now I am looking at a picture of the roadrunner from wiley cyotte however you spell it and it makes me think of apples and oragnges. That kind of scares me that random things like that just kind of pop up into my head, but oh well. Now I am wishing that I had started some music to play as a was writing this because I am almost always interested in listening to music. Yes my roomate is talking to me and he didnt know that I was home this entire time what a silly bastard. Now I am listening to Whiteny Houston who is a supposed crack head butthat doesn't really bother me because she can sing ok. I wonder how many times she does crack cocaine a day or use too. Sometimes I wonder what it feels like to be high on coke but I have never tried it. The reasons I haven't done coke is probably because most people I know that do coke are lost causes. My roomate thinks I'm an alcoholic because he heard me say I was drinking punch and I am but he thought it was trashcan punch which means his mind was on alcohol so maybe he is the alcoholic. I am not excited about having to go to three classes today because I am so very tired that I could easily take a nap and enjoy it a 100 times more. I have about 4. 25 minutes left, that makes me think about how much faster this writing assignment has gone thean I thought it would. What my life will be like 8 months from now is a random thought that just entered my mind.

She helps out with the orchestra director at my high school, I'm from Austin and am typing from home by the way, not like you really care. hmmmm. . but tonight's back to school night and thats a really big night for elementary, middle, and high schools. I didn't make the symphony last week. I didn't play my best audition so I shouldn't be suprised but I had really wanted to make it, but the University orchestra is playing some really awesome music this semester. We're playing Egmont by Beethoven, a Mendhelson piano concerto, the Mother Goose Suite by Ravel, and Second Essay for Strings by Barber. I played Adagio by Barber in high school, oh, that was an amazing performance. If there were a lever that I could press that would make me feel like I do when I'm playing a truly amazing concert I would press that all the time. I hope that I will have the same feelings in college, its just that High School orchestra was so awesome and amazing with Mr. Edwards, he picked music that we could play and that was really good too. I mean come on, Overtures to Candide, the Merry Wives of Windsor, Tancredi, and Ruslan and Ludmilla just to name a few. And in AYO, Austin Youth Orchestra, we played the full, I mean the FULL COMPLETE the Planets by Holst. People would ask me   oh, what movements?   and I would be like ALL OF THEM BABY!!! Oh!! and Scheherezade! that was a. . ahh!!! I can't even express how utterly amazing that concert was. Wow, I love music so much, but Music Theory is a pain in the ass. Not that it's all bad, alot of it is nice, but tedious. I just can't figure out and easy way for me to identify major and minor intervals. I can easinly identify perfect fifths and octaves but most people can. Well, techinically its easier for me because my instrument is tuned in fifths so each of my strings are a fifth apart and octaves, well, those are just the same note. My high school band friends love what they do so much. Its refreshing in a way to see them having the time of their life playing and having fun, doing what they love, and that is my goal too. I'm in music because I have fun doing it, recieve a joy unsurpassed doing it, and give a joy to others also. Hopefully I'm going to go se Le Mis next week.

NaN,"""""""I figured that I would put this assignment off a little more---or at least until my thoughts were more collected, but I now realize that they're am as collected now as they're ever be. I think about all that I have to do, assignments in school mostly, but I am also busy thinking about a certain person all the time. I suppose I'm going through sensory overload right now. my brain is working at a million miles an hour to keep up with the information that is being put in as fast as possible. Then there's that person I mentioned. I am confused about a certain guy that I really like. Sounds so tyipical, right? I will have to put those thoughts aside until school is over for the day. I am pretty unhappy with a lot of people that I have met at U. t. They are so interested in having a good time, all the time. Drinking and sex outside of marriage, namely. I ate lunch with an old friend that I haven't seen in a long time, and all he talked about was partying, and the like. I don't drink, because of the law (I'm 18), and I don't believe that anyone should get drunk because that's what the Bible says. Life seems so messed up. I'm not depressed about it, but I am bothered by what I see in the world. I feel a sense of hopelessnes about me, and I know where it is coming from. It started with the fall of man in the Garden of Eden. God has given man over to his wicked desires, and this means that unless God sends revival, things will continue to get worse. Also, I have been reading about the Clinton administration in a book entitled Unlimited Acess, and I think, """"""""If this is what our president is getting away with who CAN we trust?!"""""""" Of course, I don't put my faith in things which are seen, but things which are not seen. God is in complete control, and no matter how bad things seem, he will take care of His people. Some day, all of this--including the computer that I'm typing on---will burn up. God will come back to gather His elect and the those who are not will burn in the lake of fire forever. this is such a scary thought, but when you think about it it makes perfect sense. God's gift of salvation was totally voluntary on his part. He doesn't have to save anyone. We all deserve damnation because of our sin. We sinned in Adam. But in God's incredible mercy and love he sent Christ as a propitiaton for our sins that we might not perish but have everlasting life. Oh, that I might be found among those names written in the Lamb's Book of Life! I'm a terrible sinner just like everyone else. I struggle with the same problems that everyone does.

NaN,"""""""September 4, 1997   I am not too sure what to write about. I am hungry right now. I have anorexia nervosa, so I not only am constantly thinking about food, I also won't allow myself to eat it when I want it. I am actually in the recovery stages right now. I have been battling this for two years now, have been in the hospital twice, and have had therapy involving nutritional counseling, psychiatry, and group therapy. The only treatment left for someone in my position is to go to long-term therapy. That treatment would be out of state (in Arizona) and would last at least 60 days. It doesn't sound appealing to me at all, but despite the threats that my psychiatrist has faced me with, it still doesn't make it any easier to eat. The battle is all in my head. It is my mind that will not """"""""allow"""""""" me to eat when I am hungry, and it is my mind that tells me I don't need to gain weight, that I am not critically underweight, and that I am physically in good shape. The whole thing is very confusing to me. My psychiatrist has shed some light on the whole thing, but still no one can completely explain things like this that involve the mind. I think this class is interesting so far. I have enjoyed reading in the book already because I deal with this stuff on a daily basis. I am constantly battling my mind, and trying to figure out its trickery. My psychiatrist says that this is the best class out of all the ones I am taking this semester. (I think she's a little partial to the subject myself. )   I have to go see her on Tuesday, which is only 5 days away and I am scared half to death. She scares me with her threats to send me to treatment, but like I said, apparently it doesn't scare me enough because it doesn't make it any easier for me to eat.

I have had this agreement with her since the end of June. I am really very scared because I really do not think I have gained near that much. It's strange how I can think about it realistically and know that I am still not eating enough and then my irrational side of my mind will come in and tell me I am fine and don't need to gain. But, as the date comes closer to my appointment, I will start to gradually get more afraid, and get mad at myself for not doing enough. And still, that won't make it any easier to eat a thing.

However, the ballet course is only $59,,that is so not equal to $178. I wonder how long I have been writing for. Oh wow, it has already been 10 minutes! How come exercising doesn't seem to go this fast. I feel like when I am running on the treadmill that I have been going for like 15 minutes and it is actually only like 2 minutes or so. That's crazy.

I would get up and change the channel but I obviously cannot do that due to this assignment. I am starting to wonder about this course. The lectures are really interesting and class is fun. I have kept up with the readings and understood it for the most part. But when it comes down to it, will I really be able to make good grades on the tests that are compiled of both the readings and the lectures. That sort of makes me nervous.

NaN,"Well, my first psychology writing assignment, actually my frist real psychology assignment ever, in college. So technically this is my first assignment in the major of my choice. Stream-of-conciousness. Like weird Faulkner stream-of-conciousness. That was weird. Hopefully my thoughts arent as weird as that character, well I can't even think of the book or the characters at the moment. So it didnt make that much of an impression upon me. I really am mad that I can't use my own computer for this assignment. Smoothies on keyboards don't make for easy using of all the keys. So here I am, in this girl across the hall from me's room, using her computer, trying to focus upon my thoughts and whatnot while people are playing loud music, opening boxes of poptarts, slapping me for writing about them in my first psychology assignment, etc. I can't work when its too loud. Of course the main problem with this whole stream-of-conciousness assignment is that now I am think about what I am thinking about. Take a minute on that one. Am I really writing what I am thinking about or what I want you, whoever is reading it, to read. Ok now to focus more. This is one of the weirdest assignments I've ever done. But I will confess, I've thought about writing a book in stream of conciousness style before. Faulkner, Joyce (he wrote that way didnt he?) and Russell. It can't be too hard, but to be honest when your thinking about the things your smelling and feeling and seeing, its not just whatever on the paper. ) Ahhh, the smell of poptarts wafting through the air. Definately chocolate, maybe s'more. It smells so warm, and inviting and delicious. It even makes the delicious stir-fry in Jester. i had stir fry today. The chicken was gross, the vegetables stale, almost a chore to chew it. So I did what all reasonable people would do, threw it away. Despite all the starving children throughout the world, etc. Money is going fast here. Faster than I thought, its going to be a pain to call and ask the parents for some more cash. But its not like it will be the first time, or even the last. Theres just some things in life that are expected, and one of them, is asking the 'rents for money. I hope my stream-of-conciousness writing is psuedo-interesting. I mean of course it won't be Faulkner, but after all who is. Would I want it to be too Faulkner? I don't think so, I would probably become more of a study in psych than a student. I wish I wouldnt have known anything about Faulkner before this assignment, because in the back of my head, I see his dashes, random . . things, and mine isnt looking like that. Oh well. My hand is beginning to hurt a bit from typing non-stop. Oh well, in the name of science! Okay, people here are starting to talk to me while Im trying to concentrate.

HUH!! they should be helping poor homeless people off the streets. its got to be somehting psychological about that because I mean. people could work if there's nothing physical impeding them. Hten it must be mental or emotional or ptsd. my cousin, michelle, said I almost gave her ptsd. post traumatic something disorder. I thought that was funny. I wish I had an awesome sense of humor to make people and myself laugh all the time. all I can do is act like my stupid self and that makes people laugh because I'm so naive or ignorant and oblivious to something. what kind of. ok. what REALLY FREAKIN bothers me about the Church's doctrine is the frenching thing. its been bothering me for a long time. probably longer than it should. man, not EVERYONE goes straight to copulation after they french. yeah, it may arouse the man. or woman, but not really. surely not.

I'm also coughing because of a guy that lives down my hall. He was smoking earlier, and I was in the same room. On top of that, I've had a cold for the past four days. I'm all stuffed up, and I have to blow my nose again. I switched to another classical cd. I especially like some of the pieces on this cd.

This is such an amazing song. I miss taking ballet classes. I really need to get back into it. I'm so out of shape. I have this yucky flab on my thighs. And I really just miss the discipline and the beauty of dancing. I'm sick of all of the superficial drill team dancing that I've been doing for the past three years. It's all for show. I want to go back to taking classes where I can dance for the sake of dancing, where I can appreciate the beauty of it, where I can allow my emotions and my compassion to bring feeling into my movements. I guess I'm weird. I just get these really amazing feelings sometimes, especially when I'm listening to music or when I'm dancing. I just have these moments where I get Goosebumps and I'm so overcome by the feelings of the music. I really miss California a lot. And I'm still coughing because of that guy that was smoking. My throat hurts. I just remembered that someone the other day asked me how to spell """"""""throat. """""""" That kind of thing really scares me. I mean. We're in college, and someone doesn't know how to spell a simple word. I really hate it when people spell things incorrectly or use poor grammar or punctuation. It just really pisses me off.

I'm really getting tired of hitting the backspace key because I keep typing the wrong letters. I wonder if I will get anymore mail, hopefully. Its  kind of fun opening the mail box and actually having stuff in it. I didn't know where the laundry was until last night. It sucks there is nothing cool in the north tower everything is in the south tower and that is too far for me to want to walk. The light in my room is really big and the papers on my bulletin board are waving around from my air-conditioning. Its hella hot outside, I can't wait till october or november when it will cool down. The animation on my beer poster sure is shitty, I definitely got to cover it up with other pictures, I suck at spelling, its only been 6 minutes this really does feel like forever, I really just don't have a lot to say. HA the radio just said hello to me its so polite, I'm trying to decide whether or not to turn it on. For some weird reason my roommate but an empty water bottle inside a drink cup, it kind of reminds me of abstract art, like when homer tried to build a barbeque and ended up with a big pile of bricks with an umbrella sticking out. I wonder if the McLaren really is the fastest road car in the world. I'm pretty fast I think I could beat it. Al pacino looks a little up set its ok though he is about to snort a whole big pile of cocaine, what a crazy guy, all this typing is making me thirsty again. Bottled water is so stupid. Why would u pay for water that somebody else just filled up out of a tap in the backroom when u can get a cup for free. some people are just idiots. People really do look funny when they cross the finish line in races. It really is a lot harder then it seems to put the top on a bottle. I wonder if I will ever use this stapler that I brought. It does make my desk look very professional though. I ate way too much pizza, rolls, fettuccine alfredo and chicken, they all really don't mix. A blue viper is cool. My hair is getting long again if my dad sees me he will be like so son when do u want me to set up an appointment for you to get your hair cut. just because his dad was a barber doesn't mean that he knows when other people need hair cuts.

NaN,"wondering how I feel and what I'm thinking at this very moment. If only I knew, maybe I could meet up with this person and tell him/her my thoughts. I would love to share with someone I don't know. I'm afraid of rejection though. There are so many people on this campus, and hardly anyone has talked to me yet. Somehow I feel inferior to some of them. I don't know why. Everyone is equal, but some people seem so rude. I try to talk to people in my class, because that is how you make friends. So far, I have only made one friend that way. She's really nice. Her name is Christen. I met her in my German class, and we get along really well. We haven't done anything outside of class, but maybe if we keep talking to each other, we'll become closer and maybe she'll even go home with me to visit my parents. I don't understand the need for human contact. We would be so much better off if we didn't get caught up in emotions and feelings. But then again, we wouldn't be human if that didn't happen. I know I could be more efficient if I didn't need anyone else in the world, but as it is, I have faults. That's okay, though. Everyone has faults. It's just part of being human. I hope the world is full of exciting adventures for me. As I come to a close on my writing, I feel purged of all my frustrations. I had a good cry this afternoon. I miss my boyfriend so much, but I know I'll see him again soon, and that makes me very happy. I hope I can become even happier with where I am now.

NaN,"thinking about thinking. YUCK!  Couldn't the writers of the book think of something just a little more creative than that. I mean who wants to sit in lecture first thing in the morning and listen to a speech about what it means to be a critical thinker. Anyways, then I left the notetaking seminar early to go to Women in Medicine. The speaker there talked about how she had a stroke and was no longer allowed to drive and her vision was now impaired. I couldn't imagine having my driving privledges taking away from me and not being able to see. I have 20/20 vision right now but that doesn't mean that I'm a good driver. I have fallen asleep at the wheel twice in two weeks. Two weeks ago I went to Dallas to go see my friends in a band and I ended up staying in Waxahachie until 8 in the morning. When I was coming home the next day I stopped and got coffee before I headed out but sure enough about thirty minutes later I dozed off. I had to stop at a truck stop and sleep in my car for awhile. I can't believe I keep doing that. It is so dangerous and just last week a girl from my home town died in a car wreck when she was coming home and hit a tree. My Dad called this weekend, which is odd considering he just decided to flee last Christmas and not tell anyone where he was going. He said he had a dream about me and he was just making sure I was ok. I'm not sure if that was an excuse to talk to me or if he really had a dream. The reason why I wonder that is this past year all my dreams have been coming true and it is so weird. If he had a dream about me that was bad will it come true too?  Maybe it is a weird genetic thing and we have dreams that foretell the future. . just kidding. Ok well here is the countdown. I only have about 30 more seconds to type so any second now it is going to stop me. Ok my time should be about up now. Yeah ok I'm done. .

NaN,"Right now I am feeling kind of loney because I haven't really talked to anybody for about 6 hours. I'm not the kind of person who usually keeps to myself. I am very social, but with the size and and stress of college life, making friends is kind of the last thing you want to think about. Even if you do make friends sometimes you never really keep in touch with them. I'm guessing that I'm not the only one to feel like this beacause every day as I walk from class to class I see hundreds of other students walking by themselves and I can only guess that they too feel lonley at some point in the day. Also, I;m starting to think that college life isn't what I expected to be. In a way it is kind of easy because there are no eight hour class days for most people like in high school, but because of the size of some of my classes I don't really get the kind of personal attention I would get in high school. all the time I hear music in my head. It can range from something I just heard on MTV a couple of hours ago to some classical music or something we played in my high school band. Music is a big part of my life. In high school I was in the band for four years and other than making me a better player, it also made me more social and open with my feelings. I wanted to get into band over her at UT, but I never auditioned. I didn't think I was ready. I didn't think that I would be on the level of the rest of the members, and that fear was partly why I never tryed out. I want to try out next year but I have no instrument to practice on because it is too expensive to purchase. I don't consider my lonliness to be a bad thing because I'm not really sad. While in college I learned that sometimes you need your own time to just relax and think to yourself. All in all I'm happy with the way my life is going because I know that in the future college will pay off.",stream of consciousness,0,1,382,21.22,10.99,86.91,15.18,10.47,0.26,10.73,1.57,1.05,3.66,0,4.97,15.71,1.31,2.62,1.57,0.26,0.52,1.05,0.52,0,0.26,10.73,1.83,2.62,3.14,0,6.28,1.83,2.36,0.26,0.79,1.31,6.02,0.79,3.14,0.52,0,0.52,5.76,2.88,11.52,1.05,3.66,2.09,0.26,7.59,4.45,0.79,4.19,3.4,0.26,0.52,2.36,0,0.26,0.26,2.09,0.79,0,0,0,0.26,0.26,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.52,9.69,4.71,1.83,0,0.26,0,0,0,0,2.88,0,0,0

Every time I go I always expect to spend some time with my girlfriend, that actually never really happens, I don't really know how I feel about it because sometimes I feel frustrated that I cannot do anything about it but then I analyze the circumstances and then everything gets better in my head. The fist thing I have to do before I leave is get all my homework done, including this assignment that I didn't want to leave for tomorrow because then it would keep me awake all night just like all my homework does. Since the first day that I slept in this dorm, it seems that the bed is not for me or something, I cannot fall asleep, and if I do, I wake up every 20 min and look at my clock to see if it's time to go to class. I remember I used to love school when I was in high school last year, everything was so cool, nothing was going so bad to call it bad, grades, girlfriend, family MONEY, but now some times I feel so ready to just drop out and get all this stuff over with, I cannot handle so much stress, never had so much actually. anyways, the only thing that keeps me up is my own will because I know I'm not a failer. Hard times are only tests that will lead me to a high hill and then the way down will feel really good!. The biggest problem that I have and that I think already gave me a pain in my neck, well that's because I cannot sleep and keep on moving at nights so  I think that my neck pain is indirectly related to my economic problems.

NaN,"I have so many stressors in my life right now, and I've decided that since I have to do this stream of consciousness exercise anyway, this is probably the best place to vent. While being a freshman on a campus of 50,000 people is intimidating and scary, it isn't nearly as threatening as people made it out to be  at least not yet. My current stressful situations lie in areas of my life that have nothing to do with college. To be honest, right now, my biggest problem is with my parents. After being divorced for some time now, they have just gotten to the point where they have started to fight and bicker about everything, and of course, I always end up in the middle. My mother complains about how difficult her life is because of my father, which I'm sure it is. This is not to say that he is a perfect person, because I know he is not, but the way she portrays him, you would think that he is not human. My father is very critical and judgmental of everything my mother does, and the both of them feel the constant need to tell me how they feel about the other. Now, I am adult enough to realize that after a bitter divorce, there will certainly be problems. They have every right in the world to be furious with each other. All I ask is that they do not drag me into the middle of it. I have told them both this on several occasions, and they both apologize and vow to not do it again. However, before long, they are up to the same old game again, and it makes me feel about 2 inches tall. I am forced to choose sides, and since I love both my parents, this provides for a very stressful situation. I am getting to the point that I am ready to tell them both that I will not speak to either of them or have any contact what so ever until they talk to each other and get at least to the point where they can tolerate living in the same city with one another. I don't ask that they try to love each other again, or even like each other, because those days are obviously through. I just want things to be relatively peaceful and not for there to be a war zone. Another result of this fighting is the separation of me and my siblings. This has nothing to do with the fact that I live on campus, my little sister lives with my mom, and my brother lives with my dad. While this isn't the ideal living situation, there is certainly nothing awful about it. What their fighting has caused is rifts between the kids. It has gotten to the point that we choose sides against our parents, and therefore, against each other.

NaN,"I have never had an asignment like this before. It is hot in my dorm room. I always feel sweaty especially at night. It is difficult to sleep. Now that we are a few weeks in to school I can feel my self getting more and more stressed out every day. The workload is quit large, and I never have enough time to do everything i need to do. Actually right now I am between classes but i only have and hour to do this assignment, do some calculus, and eat lunch. I know I won't do one of those three. I probably won't eat lunch. Even though I am starving. i went to today and got a wristband for the OU game. The draw for tickets is tommorrow morning so i guess i am going to miss class to stand in line. If i do that and don't get a ticket i will not be happy. I wander where my girlfiend is right now i havnt seen her at all today. We live in the same building and I still rarely see her. Usually only at night, and even then we study so we don't talk much. I miss all the time we spent together when we still lived at home. We both went greek so between her sorority my fraternity and school there is maybe 30 min a day left for just talking to each other. Hopefully things will get easier later on in the semester. I live at Dobie so i have three roommates, and one of them is trying to teach himself the guitar. I am really sick of hearing his stupid guitar. Plus he sucks at it. i just accidentally pushed the back button on my computer, and when i pushed forward what i had already typed was still here but the timer started over. I wonder if that matters. I don't have time to keep tying for another twenty minutes. I am serously considering not going to my next class. I just want to eat lunch and take a nap. I just realized something funny my next class is pyschology. Oh well just because i am doing the assignment doesn't mean i have the energy to go to class. Who am i kidding i am to worried about missing something important so i will go even though i am really tired. During the last lecture i fell asleep for about 10 minutes and woke up really confused.

It's really cold in here, but it always is. I really shouldn't be getting distracted by the temperature in here. I should be more worried about the EE test that I have to take this semester or the CS class that I have to pass, although neither of them are weighing on my mind with the magnitude that they should. I'm begging to miss surfing again. I thought that the three weeks home this summer would help cure me of my love of the ocean, but it didn't. It never does. I need to be playing guitar more also. I've let it slip quite a bit here lately. I know the reason for that, I've let myself get too distracted with the girls around me. I allow them too much power over my life, and my actions. But that's ok because I'm done with all of that. I'm really going to try to cut my ties to all of what is negative in my life. Well at least as far as my friends go. I've begun to realize more and more how much people use me. The funny part of it is they all think that they're getting away with something, when in fact I'm quite aware of what is going on around me and what is happening to me. I guess I just give people to much damn credit. That's another thing I'm over. Despite how much I say I don't want those people in my life I know that I crave them being there due to my own insecurities and my need to have other gay people around me. But why the hell to I feel the need to have those gay people around me? They end up making me feel more ostracized than accepted. I'll never become what they see as normal. For that matter, I don't want to become that. I don't want to go out and sleep around, and do the drugs and all that other crap. It just occurred to me that who ever reads this will think that I'm writing this solely to seem like some good kid, yeah right. I'm not, but then again, they'll never know that. I find this assignment odd. I'd love to read what other students write, and more importantly I'd love to know how much of it is truly stream of conscious writing and how much of it is just premeditated butt kissing. Once again something I'm sure I'll never know. But sure enough something I'll ponder for at least a little while. I'm sure I'll be able to use that as an intricate procrastination method when I should be studying for one of the many classes that I'm taking this semester which are surely going to kill me.

NaN,"""""""The first thought that enters into my mind is my parents, whom I have been thinking about since I left Houston for college. It's so different here, but not necessarily bad. I have always been under the protection of my parents. But here, I don't have anyone telling me when to get up and when to go to bed, and what to do. I literally make all my choices, which I have to admit, I don't always make the best decisions. I don't study when I know I should. Sometimes having a boyfriend means spending less time doing the things that I know I should, and doing things like going out and having fun. I feel like I should be studying instead of procrastinating until the last minute. But back to my parents, I feel that the college experience is just as tough for them as for me, because I am the last kid to leave home. My mom has been crying constantly and I know that she is lonely because she doesn't have me bumming around the house and eating her food. Sometimes I even feel sad because I now realize all the things my parents have done for me. Even though I thought they were always against me. When I think about the things they have sacrificed for me, I get teary. Especially when I think about the car that my dad just bought me a day before I left for Austin. I got an Acura Integra, nothing I had ever expected. I was so ecstatic and I had never gotten such a great present in my whole life. I know that my Dad had to sacrifice by paying more money for it than I had expected. And now I'm trying not to abuse any things they had given to me and before that I had taken for granted. I really miss my parents and sometimes I have trouble dealing with it. It's tremendously difficult to do things all on my own. My values are seriously getting tested because I don't have them to give me advice anymore. All I keep thinking is how much I love them and how I can possibly show my gratitude for them. College is a tough thing. Even though I went to an enormous high school, it can't compare to college. My classes are huge, and sometimes very monotonous and boring. Surprisingly, the class I had thought was going to be tough and boring, became one of my favorites, economy. Mainly because my professor, Hamermesh, is a great teacher. He is lively and so humorous.

I wish I were staying in blanton I would like to be able to go to the lobby and hang out whenever I felt like it like people do there all the time. the only time people around here hang out is just when they are studying. I guess I could go knock on some random people's doors and watch tv with them or something. meh. I can't believe lela's dorm has a curfew. that's crazy. at first I thought she was talking about visiting hours, because we have visiting hours at eleven thirty sunday through thursday, but she was actually talking about a curfew. they have to be in the building by eleven. I guess they know who is in by who swipes their card. that is like big brother or something. 1984. I don't like it. I mean, these people are all almost 18 years old. and they are Church of Christ - going people. if they stay out past eleven or twelve, they are most likely not going to do something bad. and if they do, I think that is their problem. not the dorms'. I definitely could not live like that. I don't even like visiting hours. my hands are still cold. half the point of going to college is having more freedom. if I only wanted to take classes I would stay at home and live with my parents. but I wanted more freedom (and also to meet new people and have fun) so I guess that is what I have to do. it's a shame I am terrible at meeting new people. and they are bad at meeting me. it doesn't help that my psychology class has 550 + people in it. it's a bit insane when you have a class that is only 30 people short of your graduating class. and they all fit in one room. our class couldn't fit in one room for the longest time, until they built the new auditorium. my brother's class has a thousand in it, but they are really bad so I wonder how many they will have when he graduates.

Anyway since i get tto ventilate myself i will tell you that i like the class, no i am not trying to get some extra points though that would be nice.

I guess that i am not being the perfect daughter either if my mom only knew that her little innocent daughter moved in with her boyfriend when she moved to austin.

This is pretty cool. I wanted to roller blade and some piece of crap girl told me I couldn't because some cop told her she'd get a $50 ticket, and plus it was raining, so that sucks. I am so ready to go out. I'm getting tired of sitting in my room all the time. I wonder what Jason thinks about me. Does he still want to get back together with his exgirlfriend that sucks. If he does then he's stupid because I'm probably way cooler than her, and she's only a junior in high school. That's ridiculous. Boy's are so stupid sometimes. I can't believe the things they do. I want to play hockey. I miss playing hockey with my neighbors. Maybe I'll find somewhere to roller blade, and I'll be able to play hockey. That'd be good. Shannon wanted me to teach her how to play anyway so that would work out well since she's an RA. She'd probably know of a place around here that is good to skate on. Man, I wish my hair would grow out. It looks so dumb since its too short to get into a good pony tail and I don't feel like fixing it most of the time. I want to get purple streaks put in it. That would be pretty interesting. What if I got my eyebrow or my lip pierced? I bet that'd be weird. Just to look at yourself in the mirror with that would be different, plus my mom wouldn't freak out or anything. I hope radio shack gets that 6foot cord in soon, so I can get this TV thing working better and get some of these stupid cords out of my way. I'm glad Jason traded cable connectors with me, so I could move the TV across the room. He wasn't using the length of it anyway. I really wish my mom hadn't sold my Nintendo, Mario 3 sure would be fun right about now. I wish I was funnier. I can't ever say anything funny. I only laugh at other people or at myself when I do something stupid or klutzy. That was so funny when Bobby ran into that pole. I still can't get over that. He's a weird guy, but he sure is cute. At least Chris is finally being half nice to me. That's different. I still can't believe he sat by me in sociology today. That's so weird. Matt is my friend and he never sits by me. Butt hole.

NaN,"I feel as if my life revolves around a world full of unanswerable questions. I cannot seem to find what it is that I want out of life. There are so many options and turns where I can easily decide to follow, but I am so inconsistent of what I truly feel passionate about. I wake up in the morning and step outside of my dormitory daily smelling the fresh air. Everyday it seems as if there is something I have not witnessed before. I need answers to my life. I am a person that does not go through the day easily without understanding why things are the way they are. I am a first year student at the University of Texas and I have been bombarded with hundreds of organizations and choices that will lead me somewhere in the next few years. Not only academically has this burden faced me straight on, but I am confused about a girl I have met as well. As with the hundreds of organizations, there are hundreds of girls I see in and out of my classes. Do I really want a relationship so soon? And further, can I handle a girl that is apart of the Greek system knowing that I will never have a desire in joining one in the future? It is so hard to choose a path when you analyze your choices to death. For instance, if I decide to discontinue dating this wonderful girl just because I will not be able to tolerate her constant consumption of alcohol and nightly partying with other fraternity guys, will this decision have been the most appropriate one? Or is it possible I may be a bit too judgemental of her capabilities of being a loyal girlfriend? In addition to my social life, I have to maintain some arbitrary schedule which will be beneficial for my personal needs. Like many others, I have been set loose from the world I used to know and I am on a path where I control my line of travel. It is realistic yet frightening at the same time. All my life, choices have been easy. And if I was faced with an extenuating circumstance then I always had the parental feedback to support my decision. I am creating a life. It is not just any life; it is mine. I am on my own. I have waited for this moment for a long time. And now, I do not know what to do with it. Is this normal? Have I overlooked something? Is it humanely possible to beg and plead for an entity such as freedom and once it has been acquired to not desire its power as much? I am eager for the future and ecstatic for what is yet to come. I hope I am joining the right organizations that appeal to me. I also hope I will stay academically strong as I was in high school.

There's charcoal stains all over my shorts, and I've run out of spiffy t-  shirts to wear, so it's off to the wash. I don't know whether or not I'll   have time to do it all tomorrow as I had hoped. I also need to pay a   visit to my old high school tomorrow. I've promised my friend Katy I   would visit. There's really only three teachers I want to see: Mr. Meitz   (physics), Mrs. Hebert (English, Creative Writing), and Mr. Dennis   (Newspaper). The trinity of great teachers. And with all great figures   there has to be a   devil  . Mine is Mr. Austin, my art teacher for three   years. I looked up to him as a mentor and he turned his back on me   at the end of my senior year. I was crushed. Still I wonder if my   boyfriend brought his laundry over.  He's really not the most hygenic person in the whole world. I've had   friends tell me that he's lucky to have me because he's too   disgusting to date other women. I don't have a problem with him.  Sure he tends to go three or four days between showering, three or   four weeks between laundry cleanings, and three of four months   between room organizing, but I love him anyways. And besides, I've   been know to go a day or two or three between showers. All this   talking about him makes me want to hug him again. I think I will.  Once again, just a moment. okay, I'm done.

NaN,"As I'm sitting here at my computer I'm thinking about how bad I started off this semester. I know that I should have handled my financial aid situation a lot earlier. Plus not to mention a class of mine got cancelled which threw off my whole my whole schedule. Causing not only a first week of overcrowded bookstores and no parking, but also one of unnecessary involvement in the mass confusion of adding and dropping courses. I'm also thinking how tired I am from staying up all night studying. In the back of my mind I'm hoping to get this work study job so that I can be independent and have money but something keeps telling me it may be too much for me to work and try to stay focused on school, considering how I took 12 hours and worked this summer. I keep smelling my cologne (CK1) that I accidentally poured on my clothes this mourning. A lot more came out then I expected and it has a distinct and very strong smell that overlaps anything else. Had I not been so tired maybe I would have realized that I only needed a couple of drops. Not to mention everywhere I have went today people either say, someone put on to much cologne, or , you smell good. I 'm looking at this clock above the page trying to pace my thoughts and time. I'm also looking at the clock in my room trying to set a schedule for my self that will allow me to do all assignments and class work in a good timely manner. My brain feels cluttered with many thoughts of how much work I need to do. I'm homesick already. I miss my family and I have only been here a couple of weeks. I didn't expect this my sophomore year. I thought it only happened to freshmen. I feel really hungry too. I haven't ate all day unless you call a frappachino from starbucks as a energizer a meal. I feel pain in my knee from over playing yesterday at Gregory. I'm hoping to get a chance to play on the the basketball team. But with my luck they won't have tryouts for the second year in a row. I wonder how all my high school buddies are doing in there schools and colleges. I wonder if they found the transition from high school to college as hard as I did. Probably not because they all play sports. I think if you play sports it makes you work harder because you know if you don't you won't play. I think a lot of people have a misconception of college athletes. they think they have it easy and that they get free grades. They don't. They have a job. there coaches expect them to be robots that never get tired. While fighting through the daily soreness and injuries, they have to try to get school work done. I think that is tough.

NaN,"""""""Although overall, I am having the time of my life, finally being away from home and family and finally free from parental restrictions, it's not all fun. I'm actually on my own. I can't believe it - for the first time, I won't have my parents to rely on everything for. I'll have to take on so much more responsibility for myself. And I think I'm prepared for it too, which is a very good feeling. Even though I've made soo many new friends (and some enemies), it's not the same anymore. I don't know if that's good or bad, but it's just different. I still would've preferred going to the college I wanted to go to, Columbia U. I guess I'm still angry at my parents for not letting me go out of state. oh well, I'll just have to accept it. Right now it's late, almost midnight. I am tired and I have so much to say right now but I just can't get it all out. most of what I think about nowadays is what my future will be like and what I actually want to pursue in my education. Do I really have the commitment to study medicine? What am I going to major in? I'm just full of doubts about myself sometimes. A lot of my motivation comes from my desire to just be successful and happy in life. Right now my parents are preparing for their trip to India. They haven't been there in 2 years. I feel so distant and alienated from my relatives over there. Somehow I feel my parents' families resent me because I was actually born in America. Also, I don't really feel """"""""indian. """""""" I am American in the full sense of the word. That's been a huge conflict I've had with myself -- my ethnic identity. The indian community I have lived with tends to separate itself from other cultures, an idea which I dislike. So I find my self associating more with people of other races, which is terrific for me. However, I find myself separated often from people of my own heritage because I act different. I don't always hang out with Indian people. In fact, I rarely do. Strangely, it's a good feeling, knowing that my identity was developed by ME, not by the culture of some country my parents happened to live in less than half their lives. I don't know why I can be so bitter about this subject. I guess I just resent the idea of the Indian culture trying to shape my life. I am about ME, not about being Indian. Ok now that I'm getting into this stream of consciousness thing, I'm going to complain about something else. How about religion? I am very proud of the fact that I am a christian. However, my parents don't seem to believe I am religious because I do not shout and jump and down and speak in tongues and faint at church services.

I am very excited about taking this class because I am interested in the study of people and how their minds work. I am a little undecided on my major, and who knows:  this may be my calling. Well, maybe!  This is very fun for me being here on the world wide web. I feel like I've been in the dark for so long. I'm sitting here wondering what the people around me are doing?  Are they browsing or doing actual work. My guess is that they're doing important stuff, like I am doing. I'm looking forward to exploring other websites after this because like I said this is my first time on line. Now I can talk to my international friends and actually be in contact with my professors and teaching assistants. I have no idea how I made it through a whole year without an account. I guess that's why I missed a lot of posted assignments. O. K. now my hands are getting tired because it's been a whole summer since I've actually done work. But let me tell you it was a pretty exciting summer. I saw friends that I haven't seen in a while and had some wild and crazy times. I should have gone home to save money, but instead I stayed in a very expensive apartment on West Campus and spent all the money I worked so hard for on bills, etc. I am a waitress at Cafe Serrano's. It's a bit fun at times, and I make money on occasion. It really makes my whole opinion and view of people change. I mean, I really try to respect everyone for who they are, but when you're constantly waiting hand and foot on a bunch of stingy, angry people it kind of gets you down on people as a whole. It's a fun environment behind the scenes. I have some fun times with some great friends. We goof off and joke around, and we even hang out after work. I'll have to cut back on the hanging out part with school starting again. My boss thought it was a good idea to work me 50 hours this week. So, I'm pulling my hair out here. I'll tell her tomorrow that I cannot work this much while taking classes. I'll have a nervous breakdown. I do need the hours to pay bills, but I might be able to make it with only a few shifts a week. After all waitressing pays pretty good money when the business is there, you know. If all else fails, I'll beg my parents for a loan. whew now my hands are really tired.

NaN,"Humm. This is very different from anything I've had to do before. My finger really hurts right now because I cut it last weekend, pretty deep too, I probably should have had stitches but I didn't. Now I'm going to have a scar on my finger tip and it really hurts to type anything, especially on this keyboard because I'm in a computer lab. I'm not used to this keyboard, I like the one on my laptop but my room mate is asleep so I can't really hook it up right now. I wanted to just plug the internet into my laptop somewhere else, but I couldn't find anyplace, I tried the port in the study lounge but it's disabled. Then I had trouble getting on a computer here. I don't have an IF account because I'm in the business school, they just gave us the logins for that and I've never needed anything else. I'm just glad my friend came along because he logged on and let me submit this. I'm kind of tired. I haven't been sleeping well, I'm used to sleeping from like 8:00 in the morning until like twelve or one in the afternoon. This weekend I didn't sleep Friday night, and I partied Saturday night and didn't go to bed until like six in the morning on Sunday. I slept like nine hours then though because I had been up for forty-six. This week has been weird hours too. Sunday night I slept for like two hours, that wasn't bad, my body only needs like five hours of sleep or so before I wake up and can't go back to sleep. Anyways, two hours sunday night, then I got four on Monday night, none on Tuesday night, and then about three and a half last night. Now is like 4:30 I think, the clock on the computer says 3:39 but I think it's wrong because I thought the clock on the wall said like 4:15 when I came in from smoking a cigarette. MMM. cigarette sounds like a good idea but I have to study some more after this. The sleep schedule that I have is kind of weird with classes in the morning, but I've been doing a lot of studying lately. I hang out with my friends during the day and then study with a few of them at night. Tonight it was me and my friend Cimu and Kenchi studying, Cimu went to bed at like 3:30 or so. Kenchi is here now thank god or I wouldn't have been able to do this until the morning when my roommate wakes up. She goes to bed at like 11:30 and sleeps until like 10:00 in the morning. I don't understand how a person can sleep that long, I can try to go to sleep at a decent hour but it doesn't matter because I have to lay there for like an hour and a half before I fall asleep. Then once I finally do get to sleep I only sleep for like four",stream of consciousness,0,1,518,19.92,11,86.49,13.32,10.42,0.19,10.62,0,0.77,2.9,0,5.98,13.51,5.41,2.32,0.77,0.19,0,1.54,0,0.19,0.39,6.76,1.54,0.97,2.9,0,3.28,0.39,0.58,0,0.58,0,2.9,0.58,0.97,0.97,0,0.19,11.78,5.02,9.65,0,3.67,2.7,0,7.53,3.47,1.16,2.7,1.54,0.19,0.39,0.97,0.97,0,0,0,0,0.19,0.19,0,3.67,0.77,0,0,3.67,0,0,0,2.9,14.67,4.83,3.67,1.35,0,0,0,0.19,0,4.63,0,0,0
NaN,"Right now, I am feeling a little tired, a little overwhelmed, excited, and also a little afraid. I am tired both because of lack of sleep and because of exercise. I am feeling a little overwhelmed because of all the new surroundings and situations that I have found myself in in the last couple of weeks. Its not really that I am overloaded with work (yet), it is just that I am still getting used to everything here: new and different classes, new ways of studying and testing, new teachers and techniques of teaching, etc. I am also overwhelmed with the new social surroundings: a new room, roommate, sleeping schedule, eating schedule, etc. I am excited because I think I am going to enjoy living and going to school here. I am excited about taking courses that I'm actually interested in, and about having teachers that enjoy their profession and know what they are doing. I am excited about meeting new people. One of the things that I enjoy most about Austin is the diversity of the people you can find here. No matter what kind of person you are, you can find someone similar to you who share the same interests and concerns. I have already met some very fascinating people. Austin is an exciting place to live even if you are not attending the University. If I'm not mistaken, it is the music capitol of the world. I could go on for a long time about all the reasons why I am excited. I am afraid mainly for the same reasons that I am overwhelmed. Mostly I am afraid that I do not know how to take notes and study properly. I find myself looking at others people's notes during lecture to see if I am writing down the important things and whether or not I am getting the point. My mom says that in time, I will learn what to write down, read, and study. I have never been a very good test taker. My biggest fear of all is the fact that I have always relied on the one on one attention that I received from my teachers in the past to get me through school. Now that I am attending the largest University in the county, I know that that is impractical. However, I plan on taking all advantages offered to me by my teachers and their aids. With an average of 540 students in your classes, I know that you cannot offer that same oneonone environment. That is my greatest concern.",stream of consciousness,0,1,427,17.79,18.97,83.61,13.35,9.84,0,9.84,1.64,0.7,1.87,0,6.56,11.94,0.94,5.15,3.28,0.7,0.23,1.87,1.87,0,0.94,7.96,2.11,3.51,0.94,0,1.64,2.11,1.64,0.7,0.23,0.47,5.62,0.94,2.81,0.23,0.23,1.17,4.22,1.17,12.88,0.23,2.81,0.94,0.47,6.79,4.45,1.41,5.39,4.68,0.7,0.23,1.41,0.94,0.23,0,0.23,0,0,0,0,1.41,0.7,0.23,0.23,0.94,0,0,0,0,12.18,5.62,4.92,0.47,0,0,0,0,0,0.7,0.47,0,0

My classes seem okay and I'm sure I'll do fine. I don't feel at all homesick, which is good. My parents miss me so much though and I feel bad for that. I'm going home this weekend even though I don't want to, but that's okay. I don't think I'm doing this right. no one will probably ever read this so why should I care. I feel like such a number at this school, but I am determined to change that. I feel like I'm writing in my journal. Emily and Annie are over here too and they brought their homework. I wish I had brought mine. I am so afraid that I'm going to get behind in my classes and not make good grades. I want a gpa of 3. 5 or better. Maybe it was stupid to set a goal that high, but that's good for me because last year I could have done a lot better. I don't regret it though, I had a very nice senior year. This year I want to study very hard though and be able to say I tried my hardest. I also want to get a PhD in psychology. I don't know why though because I just want to be a housewife. I love the idea of people calling me Dr. Hutchins though, that would be so cool. Being a medical doctor is waht my heart desires, but I can't stand the sight of blood. that causes a problem. So, I figured I'd help people another way. If I do work I want to be a child psychologist. I have a passion for kids and want to help as many as I can. That's why I want to be a housewife, so I can be with my kids all day. I'm getting tired of typing now, it should have been 15 min, not 20. I wonder what other people are going to type about. My back is hurting from sitting like this so I'm going to stop. it's been 20 min anyway. I feel weird writing something for school and not using any kind of format, but I really enjoyed it because I hate English with a passion.

NaN,"""""""I hate this type of assignment, the kind of work that tries to force a thought into one's head. Thoughts should come naturally, and when the mind is prompted, then nothing comes to it. Well, as long as I'm supposed to be thinking, let's think about why I'm doing this. It's to get a good grade. Why do I do anything. I always seem to respond in a manner in which the answer seems acceptable to everyone else. Maybe I'm doing this to please everyone else: my instructor, my parents, myself. So why do I do everything else that I do?  Why do I devote so much time to working out and exercise?  Is it because I want to fool myself into living longer?  Is it to mold my body in such a way as to attract others and get their attentions. I always say that I just don't want to become weak, that when I find someone to protect, I want to be able to protect them. But if I am always desparately trying to find this person that would fill the current void in my life, why is it I push everyone away?  My friends, my peers, my elders?  I don't do what everyone says is """"""""fun. """"""""  I don't hang around others for long, I don't go to parties, and I rarely impart what I truly feel. It seems as if I've been hiding half my life, hiding from others and from myself. Inside, I scream to myself, """"""""go out have fun meet new people you boring dolt!""""""""  and in my mind I'm always prepared to do so, but when the moment of truth comes about, I never act out my true intentions, either being intimidated or discouraged. I remember when I went to that UT freshman orientation. My friend said when you get to the dance, just go up to people, introduce yourself, and ask for a dance. And he's a loser. But it worked for him, so I tried it myself. The first time, rejected. The second time, rejected. The third time, rejected, and even I know that 3 strikes is out. I get so sick of hearing excuses like oh I'm too tired or I don't feel like it. Yeah right. Then why the hell are you here at the dance?  Just give me a straight and vehement no and I'll be on my way, not even to think twice about the encounter. Now on strike three, I had another reason for retiring that night. That girl, the way she looked, the way she acted, it was deja vu. I went to another country with a girl like that, stood by her side, opened my heart to her, and offered it to her. She led me on, to believe that for once, I had an opportunity for love, that it was my time in the spotlight, and with the most beautiful girl I have ever been with.

I'm with jeff now and he's better than having all the money in the world. I kind of regret not going to boston college though. that was my dream. that was my huge sigh of relief after high school. that was the product of 12 years of overachieving. UT isn't bad. it's not great either. some people say it's like an Ivy League school but I highly doubt that. I would pick an east coast school over hicktown UT anytime. but since I'm here I have to make the best of this situation and endure the poor weather and large campus. six more minutes of writing. that means I can start thinking about what to do next. I think I'll read psychology since that's what I'm doing now. just the first chapter tonight then the first chapter in chemistry. that should do me for now then rhetoric I have to read chapters two through three. I think I've got it together now. 4 more minutes. wow, it's already been twenty minutes! this assignment relieved me of a lot of stress already! now I just have to read and take really good notes. no more online junk to take care of anymore. I have using the computer. don't people know that handwriting things is the best way to learn and memorize? well, I guess for me others love it. yes one more minute.

I have so much homework everyday and I don't know I hate precal. and I have homework in that class all the time and now I have to worry about the precal test on Monday. and dietary analysis do on Friday. and nutrition and psychology test on Monday after that oh my gosh I guess the professors just like to torture us by having due dates and test all in the same day and I have a tennis tryout on Monday. that means I have to skip my psychology class and my tasp thing. gosh. and I don't know why. but I just can't pass tasp I know that English is my second language but I've written so many paper. and I do ok on them but I just don't understand why I can't pass writing part on the tasp this is crazy. and since this is the first semester in ut I haven't got an apartment and so my parents is making me living with our family friends and I really really don't enjoy being with them so.

I study but I just don't know why sometimes I still can't get it but oh well and I just got a new car but I just don't want to drive back and forth because that would be too much miles I don't know why I worry so much about my miles either gosh.

I have been stressing all day about when I was going to find the time to do my psychology writing assignment. I honestly feel like I have not had time in the past 6 days to even sit down for twenty minutes just to type out a stream of my thoughts. This is a pretty neat assignment. I am thinking about how I missed my metals class last Thursday from eight o'clock in the morning until noon. Since I missed the lab, I have to go in this Friday from like eleven until my two o'clock government section. Right now I am so tired I can hardly even think about my day on Friday. I am also thinking about what I am going to do tonight. I wasn't really planning on going out, but one of my friends in my Government class today asked me if I was going to go with her, so I ended up having to go because I would have felt bad saying no to her. What about the pre-testing I am going to do after this writing assignment?  I hope it is not hard because I think my brain will just about break down. I really like psychology. I was talking to my dad about it on the phone yesterday, and I was asking him how I wondered why I never took a psychology class before. My high school offered psychology classes, I just never thought to take them. I took Sociology instead, and I actually didn't even like it very much which is weird because I ended up taking it once again before Psychology in College. I was actually thinking about my schedule for next semester. It is crazy, but I am actually already stressed about things for next year, like where I'm going to live, what classes I am going to take, make sure I live somewhere close to a bus stop. My bedroom is up the stairs in my apartment, it is pretty cool because me and one of my best friends live upstairs, and my other best friend lives downstairs. It is so cool because we have a great location, I mean, we are close to anything there is fun to do on West Campus. We can walk almost to any fraternity party, and to other of our friends' apartments who live around us. I ride the bus to class everyday, even though I could walk if I wanted too, but of course I don't. Plus, all of my classes are at the Art Building, and the West Campus bus takes you directly from almost the front of my apartment complex to the front doors of the Art Building.

NaN,"""""""My friends keep me awake until ridiculously late hours, and then are so inconsiderate as to wake me up early in the morning. Today for example, my friend Kevin woke me up around 9 this morning, after keeping me awake until 4 in the morning! I have 4 and a half hours of classes on this day, not to mention a bible study at 7, and I'm supposed to help clean up the Erwin Center for a fund raiser after the Shania Twain concert. I don't think I'm going to do that though, as I really need to catch up on some sleep. At the same time though, I'm also excited to hear from my friend Jaren in Maine. There's really a weird story behind how we met. As most people do nowadays, I was chatting online in one of the chatrooms. This girl was the only one who didn't seem to lie about how pretty she is and how rich she is etc. , so I had a fascination with her from the beginning. She actually sent me the private message first and asked where I was from, what I do for fun, what I look like etc. From that day on, there hasn't been a single day where we haven't written each other. After a few months in fact, we began calling each other on a regular basis, which didn't please my parents at all. hehe. I know her better than her friends do, which really gives me much pleasure. We send each other pictures and we're really open about what we do and stuff. I don't think I've ever kept anything from her, and I know she doesn't keep anything from me because she tells me things that she knows would upset me, but she tells them anyway. Over these last few months, I've grown to love her as a girlfriend. Weird, I know. Well, she feels the same about me and she's planning on visiting for the first time sometime this winter. I even get jealous when she talks about other guys, which is really weird, first of all because we've never met in person, and second of all, because she lives over a 1000 miles away. Talking about her always reminds me of my other friend Christina. There's another funny story behind this relationship as well. She was best friends with one of my good friends, Yoon. Well, Yoon liked this one guy named Young, and they always hung out together. Christina and this guy Brian hung out with them too all the time. Well, Brian started to like Christina and she detests him, so she felt really uncomfortable alone with him. One time, she felt so awkward, that she decided to call me, even thought we'd never met or talked before ever, rather than have to talk to Brian. Yoon gave her my number and told Christina that I was easy to talk to and to get along with. Well, Christina and I ended up talking for over 4 hours that night.

I really wish he would tell me how he truly feels about me and about us. I am so frustrated with it all. I be psychologists get a lot of complaints about men from us women. I am really sure of that. I am really realizing that men don't communicate very well about relationships. Unless you are talking about football or cars, you might as well forget. it. I really don't know how to take his comment this weekend that he likes cars better than he likes women. I really take offense to that comment. I really think that that is personally directed to me.

I am not trying to make him choose me or hit the road, but I just don't want this to drag on for five years of my life and then end. I just don't want to waste any more time in my life. I know if I would have stayed with my high school boyfriend, we would probably be married by now and maybe even be happy, but things never felt complete with him and I am so glad that I realized that back then. With Stephen, things feel so much more real and I really think that is why things have seemed so much harder. We have been through a lot this past year together. With my whole surgery and illness, he sure was great. A lot of men that might have to deal with a sick girlfriend going through surgery and IV treatments would run and never look back. Not him. Thankfully God gave him the patience to put up with me and stick things out with me and help me get through such a trying time. This past year really has been a trying one. I was in the hospital numerous times, had about 8 inches of my small and large intestines removed, went through a four month new IV treatment and all at the same time tried to find a medication that would help keep my body in remission.

I have two conflicting thoughts now. On one side the easies gives me more time to relax. It is night now and I am not really in the relaxing mood. I want to go out and do something but somehow I am more dependent on other people to be able to do something than I was living with my parents. My expectations of independence have not been meet yet. I am now thinking that other people would get angered or distraught about this fact but my reaction is unlike that. I tend to just formulate new expectations and throw the other ones out. Speaking of throwing things out, the trash is damn full. This assignment is already starting to bore me and I just started it. I wish I didn't have separate classes instead just one big project that consisted of elements taught in my classes that I could dedicate my time to. I find these big projects to be more worthwhile and challenging. When things aren't challenging, I must event a challenging task or at least a large one. Physical fitness a first was one of these challenges but it has changed. Now I workout for relaxation and for selfimage. Naturally I am shy. This bothers me because being shy involves things that don't make sense to me. I really have nothing to lose by going out on a limb to talk to someone or present an idea but if I don't remind myself of these things talking to someone isn't a natural reaction. I am pronature in many respects. I am against the taking of medicine to the point won't take aspirin. I am even against vitamins because nothing can replace natural foods.

I was like 6 when this happened and though my parents have changed I haven't. I don't let anything affect me anymore. I have been away from my mom, dad, brother, sister, and dog and I don't really miss them. Talking about the past too long also bores me.

And I consider how closely indeed my present ambitions are tied to my trauma and exhilaration as a young child. Now, I feel the only way I can attain happiness is to create something. To form a tangible pillar of my individuality and soul. I need to see my doubt, anger, passion, fear, fascination, and every substance of my mind materialize. Now, in this search to form and mold the outer world, I turn to literature, to books and stories of others, tales with which I can empathize and understand. My hunger for reading is insatiable. Everything from novels, to scientific articles, to textbooks, to philosophical papers, I want it all. I want to absorb it so that I don't miss an ounce of life. I want to share every shape and substance of time, to reflect on all thoughts before me so that I can mold those after. And in all of this, with all the knowledge, as I absorb the mind of others through their literary creations, I feel great anxiety in that I have not made a contribution of my own. Many projects that I saw as the key to overcoming this inaction and dullness have fallen short. My passions flow like a liquid, undulating and turning over, never constant, never culminating into a final insight or enlightenment. Several novels begun on my own, yet my mind drifts to other settings, other plots and themes, other characters and personalities. I can never immerse myself in the fictitious, because my own thoughts are unstable. The worlds I put on paper dissolve, evaporate and disintegrate into the torrent of my consciousness.

When everything rested on today, on that ice cream cone after enduring an afternoon of chores, on that TV show that I've waited for all night. These were simple pleasures, now caught up in the mad flood of responsibility and maturation. It makes me so tired to look forward. To never be now. My parents were demanding. Good grades, a clean room, church attendance, moral infallibility. Always left behind in someone's expectations. Enslaved to your own dedication and attachment. I loved them then. Cherished them. Everything I did was to attain their approval. Then I would dismiss any pleasure if only for a few words of gratitude or a compliment. An ovation of some sort. I need approval. I still do.

Anyway, I have so much work to do and I don't feel like doing any of it. And just thinking that I have my economics class at 8:00AM tomorrow doesn't make me feel any better. I can't wait until my weekend comes. This past weekend was awesome. My friends came up to visit me for the whole weekend and we went out and stuff. My boyfriend, who I haven't seen in about a month, also came up with one of my best friends on Sat. I was really happy. Gosh!!! I am really uncomfortable in this chair at this desk. I have to put the keyboard in my lap because we don't have anywhere to put it. my back is hurting. my roomate looks like she's really comfortable in her bed while I'm here all twisted in my chair trying to type. I wonder why I'm having trouble thinking of things . It should be easy to just type whatever comes to my head, but, it's like my mind is not all here. I can't believe that I almost lst my key today. I got home after being gone to two cclasses and I realize that my key is gone. I don't have fifty dollars to just throw away. I wish I was kind of rich. no, not rich just better off than I am right now. I would just like to live comfortably. with just a little extra cash in my pocket. ouch ! my back is really bothering me right now. maybe after I finish this I should go and check if I can get on that pretesting thing again. waht is I keep haveing trouble with it?  and, what if I never get it to work?  then what?  well, maybe I can go to somebody elses computer to do it. I wonder if it's the computer that is not working. I don;t know . but then again, I'm also computer illiterate. I can't bele\ieve that 20 minutes have not gone by yet. ohhh, I;m so tired. I still have to do more homework and I'm sleepy. I'm also getting kind of lazy to go work out, but, I have to go because I missed this whole past weekend. I feel like I'm getting fat even though I eat salads and baked potatoes   every day. the jester food is gross. ooh, that late night food last night was so gross. It was extremely greasy. eating that stuff on a regular basis can make you really fat in no time. I hope I don't gaing those freshman fifteen . that would suck.

I mean, obviously you don't want you SSN to be taken, but if youre telling Carla you have to speak quietly?!  So no one overhears you?!  What the hell?  I read it out loud to my roommate and good friend from high school, Margaret and she said it was probably serious because our freshman English teacher in high school got her social security number stolen. I was sick this morning and I skipped all my classes. I don't know if I should write that because now maybe you think I'm a slacker. But I really felt like complete shit. I did go out last night til like 3,  but I'm really snotty and coughing up phlegm. So last night when I got home, I had to walk home early because Margaret felt like way faint and was supertired and her face was white-it was weird. So we came back and I was a little drunk and I called my ex from high school, but he's still my best friend and we talk all the time, Jacob. It was so funny, he answered the phone- I was really surprised because he sleeps like a log, but he answered and sounded kind of awake so I asked him if i woke him up and he said no he was about to take a nap though. But I'm sure he was woken up. I really like him and I think I'll probably end up with him someday just because I can't picture ever having a friend I can confide in as much as him and I feel like he knows me inside and out-however cheesy that may seem. But I still get elated when he calls me and I love talking to him most of the time. I'm really excited because tonite I'm going to KA pledge line!  with one of my friends from high school, daniel, a KA pledge. I can't decide if i should wear this black tube dress with a white ribbon on it or this black mock turtleneck dress thats a little bit longer and supertight. Its very flattering, but it seems like guys always like strapless stuff and I have to wear my superhigh heeled shoes with the mock turtleneck dress and a lot of guys like petite girls. I might go with that one anyway though because I have like a zit on my chest and it shows with the tube one. But I've met Jeb Bush a few times and I'm way starstruck with him and want to go on a date with him really bad just so I can say I could kind of, and he's kind of short. But I have a crush on this pothead (of course)  I'm always attracted to that type (except Jacob) who's tall and his name is Clayton.

NaN,"in a Jane Austen novel. they're so warm. There's such a sense of how to act without ever having to think. I wish I didn't think. I try to keep myself so busy that I don't, but my mind won't be constrained. Its only controlled by the window, my looking glass sanctuary. Its solitude without loneliness. I feel the most lonely with lots of people. on the south mall at noon, walking to class. So many people with such well put together lives, purposeful strides and slender hips. I watch them. I am behind a tree. I wear long skirts to cover what I wish wasn't there, with my thick dark hair pulled back, tugging on my wrinkled shirt that won't ever stay into place. I am magic though, I have powers. I can be invisible. No one ever knows that I'm there. No one ever knows I'm at my window with its menagerie of colored lights. I don't know about anything anymore. I wish someone would just tell me what I'm supposed to do. that there was some fated order of things. That would be easy to accept, that is why we have religion. It gives you all the whys and leaves you only the what is. but for some of us that won't suffice. No doctrine will halt the whys of my mind, I will always wonder about it if not the things it claims. I'm confused and lonely and at my window. It doesn't make sense. But tomorrow I'll get up and I'll go to class. I'll say hi to all my friends and smile. The weird thing is I'll even enjoy it and be distracted so that I only focus on the what is. I'll watch TV and do homework, and probably even go to a club with the cute guy I can't ever date because he happens to be my untrustworthy boyfriends cousin. (yes there are so many problems). But then I'll go to bed. I'll lie and look out the pane that sensitizes me to my pain, and I'll think about all the whys of my life and how I'll probably never figure them out, just how to distract myself from them.

NaN,"""""""I don't know a lot of people in every one of my classes and that makes me nervous and anxious. I guess I also am feeling very excited too. I am away from home, from parents and rules, and away from people I know. I like familiarity. That is like a comforting thought to me. I can't stand the fact that this school is so huge that I don't even know where my next class is. All I want to do is curl up in my dorm bed and stay there. Even though I don't like my bed at all because it isn't like mine at home, it will do. I am excited about the weekend that is coming up. I get to go home and see my family, my boyfriend, and my friends. I wake up every day from the day I got here to look forward to this weekend. I don't know why, but I guess I am lonesome. In addition, I didn't make the Longhorn Band, which was very upsetting to me. I am very upset that I didn't make it because I knew I could have. It's just that in the back of my mind, I knew that if I make Longhorn Band, I wouldn't be able to go home to visit as much I want to. So, I really didn't give the audition my best shot because, as much as I wanted to make it, I didn't want to just as much. No matter which way I looked at that, I guess I feel good that I didn't make it and I regret it because I wanted to make it also. That was a conflicting feeling that was bothering me too. Another thing that scares me is that I made the decision to take Chemistry even though I did rather poorly in high school. But something in me just wanted to take it and prove to myself that I wasn't dumb in Chemistry. I just am stubborn when it comes to giving up. I can't stand it when I can't finish something or I am not good at something that I could be. Maybe that's why I am so confused about the Band thing. No matter what, I want to kick myself for not making it, but on the other hand, I am jumping for joy because I know I won't be as stressed out and have time to do stuff. I was in Band all through high school and I guess I decided to continue in college because it was a familiar thing for me. Plus, I had such a bad experience with band directors that I was rather wary of the ones here. But I made such great friends in Band that I am afraid that I won't have any while I am here not in Band.

I have nothing against my roommate, my dorm, or this college, but I feel that they cannot replace the friends, accommodations, and schools that I have become accustomed to over the past 18 years.

I am wasting this time because I don't feel any need to be introspective. I feel that I know myself pretty well, both strengths and weaknesses, I that I have no need to further analyze my thoughts. I am very surprised how painless that has bee thus far. I'm sure that my high school English teachers would die when if they saw how many sentences I started with """"""""I"""""""". Although you can not see this, thanks to the wonders of modern technology, it just took me about eight tries to correctly spell the word """"""""saw"""""""". Did you notice that I also spelled out the word EIGHT. It has now been twelve minutes and it is time for a short bathroom break. I hope that this writing is still here when I come back. I'm back. That took about a minute. Sorry. I meant to right ONE minute. I wonder what other people are writing for this assignment. I wonder how many people will try to suck up by complementing the professor, or how many will tell of their dislike for this class? I wonder how many will try to be introspective and artistic, and end up writing free verse poetry? I feel that such people, who think themselves to be deep and philosophical, are the exact opposite, fake and shallow. I feel that my fingers are not fast enough to keep up with my thoughts. As this assignment comes to an end I wonder what I was supposed to have learned, for I feel that I am none the wiser. TWENTY minutes have now passed. The END.

I am sytressing out right now, and I am trying to not think about how much I need to do. Each time I finish with one task I feel a little better but after a few minutes I get stressed out again. I can not wait for the labor day weekend though, because I am going to spend some of time catching up with all of my readings and some of my time just relaxing. I think after Labor day I will be relaxed and I will not be so stressed out with all of my work. I like my job in the mornings on Teusday and Thursday, I work at a daycare for infants. I work with the two months to two years, from eight in the morning until twelve-thirty in the afternoon. I like working with that age of children, because they are so trusting. They are away from their parents, but they still are so relaxed and trusting with all of the teachers at the daycare. I feel dumb writting this, because I have so much going through my mind but I can't write it all down, because most of it is the same thing over and over.

I feel that if I get behind at the begining of the semester, I will never be able to catch up, and I will not reach my GPA goal. I am a very opptimistic person though, so I know that if I keep up with my work I will be able to reach my goal, and maybe even get higher. Another thing though is that I should be a junior in years, but I am nine hours short, so over next semester and the summer I have to catch up, so that I can graduate on time. I am not worried about that, I am more concerned with my grades, because I know that I can catch up in summer, and next semester. I feel a little bit better no that I have almost completed this assignment, so that is a little off my head that I do not have to worry about. Now all I have to do is read 300 pages for three more of my classes, and do the pretesting, although it won't let me on right now. maybe when I am done with this assignment I can get connected to the pretesting, but if not I will have to wait for tomorrow to do that, because right now I have to go buy some more books.",stream of consciousness,0,1,510,24.29,12.94,87.25,14.12,12.55,0,12.55,0,0.78,2.16,0,5.29,17.45,1.96,2.55,1.37,0,0.39,1.18,0.98,0.2,0,7.06,1.76,0.98,1.96,0.39,1.96,1.57,0.98,0.2,0,0.78,1.96,0.39,0.78,0,0.2,0.59,9.61,0.2,13.73,2.55,3.92,2.55,0.39,7.25,4.51,1.18,6.67,3.14,2.35,2.55,0.2,0.2,0,0,0,0.39,0,0,0,0.2,0.2,0,0,0,0,0.2,0,0.39,9.41,4.12,4.71,0,0,0,0,0.2,0,0.39,0,0,0

I am definately having mixed thoughts about having a boyfriend at this moment because of all the new people I have met and would definately like to meet, get to know, and date. My boyfriend is totally mad because he is so jealous. I hate jealous people I wish everyone would just, I don't know go along with it. I ate the grosests food in jester cafeteria today and had the weirdest conversation with two very interesting and cool guys that I have already met from camptexas. That was like almost the most fun I've had in a really long time I'm so glad I decided to go and wasn't to scared. I was so scared about coming to UT  because it is so big and I just didn't know if I could adjust after going to such a small catholic school. I'm so glad to be away from old people and meeting knew ones. High school was such an almost horrible experience, I hope college is so much better. So I'm in this room with these two guys, one who I met at camptexas and he looks exactly like the guy from rookie of the year he doesn't know it but I have this incredible, horrible, obssesion with him. He is just the hottest guy I have ever seen. So I met this really cool guy from tarytown in New York which is like the place I've been obssessed with since forever. He is a guy I would really like to hang out with. This other guy who is rookie of the years roomate is totally obssessed with Britany Spears I really can't stand her but I think it is just because I am so jealous that he likes her more than me. And Drew has almost naked women pictures all over his wall that makes me very jealous and I was just thinking about jealous people. The music is blasting in my ear I don't know who it is. Drew complains a lot about college ruled spirals and needing more space. I really hate that my roomate and myself don't have much in common. Everyone else seems to be like best friends with their roomates I need a really good girl friend to hang out with. Or maybe I'm just ment to have guy friends. I guess it would be okay with me I get along with  them better. I think classes are going to be really fun and not too hard. Which is really a relief because I though it would be really hard.

Well, not polygamy, but i wish i could take more than one girl to texas OU weekend.  i have like 4 or 5 girls that i would enjoy taking,k and who are all expecting me to take them, but no matter what i do, i am going to piss like 4 girls off. It kind of sucks. I am glad that i can at least take one date, but it is a complicated matter when it comes to toying with peoples, especially girl's emotions. I think i have pretty much decided on who i am going to ask, but i heard that she has a boyfriend, so im not sure about it any more. While this kind of makes me angry, i guess it helps me out in deciding who i am going to ask. I don't even know, there is a girl who lives down the hall from me, and is actually in this class. I am sure it will all work out anyway.    I guess when it comes down to it i am lucky to even be here. ( at UT ). A subject that occupies my mind a lot of the time is what happened to me this summer. Basically i went out to fraternity rush party, had way to much to drink. I wish to God someone had been there to take away my keys, but no one was, and i got in my car, drove the wrong way and ended up putting my car into a lake. When i say putting, i mean a 30mph plunge down a boat ramp. I realize that i have almost died and i have spent many hours dwelling on what happend, what could have happened, and thank God, where i am now. The only real problem is how i live now. Any other person would have sworn off drinking for good, but i continue to do it, even though i told my parents i wouldn't. This makes me feel guilty, and upset. I don't really know what im going to do about the whole situation, but i am determined to make my parents realize that i am as responsible as ever, and not to disappoint them.   I miss my dog like crazy, which is weird, cause i don't really miss my parents that much. I guess its because i can talk to my parents, but i can't call my dog and see how hes doing. I wish i could have my dog here with me, cause he really is my best friend. I love dogs, they never smart off to you, and they don't stay mad at you.     I love college life, fraternity life, and everything else, i just hope that i don't get too bogged down with partying, and stuff, that ill be to busy to study and do well.",stream of consciousness,0,1,477,19.08,8.81,84.49,17.82,13.63,0,13.63,0.42,1.26,2.73,0,2.73,11.11,1.47,5.87,3.14,0.84,0.63,2.73,0.21,0.84,0.63,10.06,1.05,1.89,4.19,0.21,3.77,1.05,2.31,0.21,1.47,0.21,7.55,1.47,2.1,0.42,0.84,1.47,2.52,3.14,15.72,0.63,3.77,0.63,1.47,5.66,5.66,2.31,2.31,1.47,0.42,0.63,0.21,0.21,0,0,0,0.21,0.63,0.42,0.21,1.05,0.21,0.42,0.42,0,0,0.42,0,0.63,14.88,5.24,7.55,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.68,0.42,0,0

NaN,"""""""I wish I had a car though, but I think that will bug me for a while because it'll probably be a while until I can afford one. But I will always get by, I know. Well it appears that laundry day is tomorrow, so I still have to wake up at 7 am even though I have no classes till three but then again that's probably why it's laundry day. Well I didn't get to talk to my girlfriend tonight because she was in class late, but at least she's at class. That's good because she needs to go to class as often as possible to pull up her GPA so maybe just maybe she can come to Austin and live somewhere around here. I wonder if whoever reads this will ever understand why people ramble. Anyway, I'll call her tomorrow to see how her first day at community college is. It's pretty nice in my appt right now, a cool 70 degrees which is nice after having to carry about 50 pounds of groceries up a hill and up a flight of stairs. Just kept on saying """"""""Can you feel that!"""""""" to keep myself from stopping because once you stop you just might not be able to start again. I guess that's the focus to my whole life. Not sure if that's good or bad or what. Probably what got me in trouble last semester when I was half way thru the semester. Pretty crazy that I'm my worst enemy, but in a way, I guess that makes me my best friend (except for my girlfriend and real best friend of course) but if I didn't kick my own butt to do better who would?  So I just keep on chugging. I don't know why I'm so success driven?  Lord knows I'd like to be able to loosen up a bit and have some fun, but I never can seem to do that. Try alcohol to do that, but pretty sure my body didn't take too much of a liking to that. Oh well. I'll probably grow out of it (please please please). So enough of that, I hope the Aggies have lost against FSU because then I get to email my Ag friends and laugh. But then again that might not be the greatest idea if the Horns don't fair that well this year. Don't know what I'm listening to on the radio now. Oh yea ACDC!! Rock on! Anyway, I loved that Howard Stern movie, not quite sure why, but you almost have to love someone that pathetic. Movies, that's a topic. I love going to see movies. Just like the escape I guess. Thrillers are the best, not the goory (sp?) ones but like the one with Kevin Spacy Usual Suspects, that movie was great. Also, that Primal Fear was terrific, saving that line for the last was brilliant technique, and the acting superbe.

NaN,"the seriousness of the 11th events, terrorists and all that now more than ever. Maybe because I am older or am paying closer attention to the news, reading more articles in newspapers. Nevertheless, I am bothered by this whole change in our world. I have a lot of homework to do, a girlfriend, tuition and bills to pay, a career to study for, I have plans of becoming a doctor one day and I have just recently realized how much work that is going to be. I never anticipated this much stress or responsibilities in college. I am 20, should this much stuff be present in my life?  You know, I heard Amazing Grace today played at one of the memorial ceremonies on TV tonight and was emotionally moved. That song always does that to me. It can played on the trumpet, piano, organ, or bagpipes-it doenst matter, it always gets to me. I wonder what it is about that song that moves me so much. That was the first song I ever played on the piano and trumpet if I am remembering correctly. I miss my parents, mostly my little sister. I am going back this weekend, but I am starting to contemplate whether or not that is a good idea because I have mcuh homework to finish. I guess thats another struggles I am dealing with in my life currently. I started thinking about how much I love my grandparents. They live right up a little path from our house in San Antonio and I realized that they will not be on this earth for too much longer. I would see them all the time growing up and even through high school. Now I rarely ever see them because I am in college. I will, hopefully, have years and years after their deaths to study or do whatever, is it wise and the best thing for me to miss out on the time I have now to spend with them?  Is spending time in college worth the sacrifice I am making. Why can't I spend as much time with them as possible now when we are here on earth together before they pass on.",stream of consciousness,0,1,366,17.43,15.3,80.33,14.21,9.84,0.82,10.66,0.27,2.19,1.37,0,4.64,13.66,1.37,4.1,2.46,0.27,0.55,1.64,0.55,0.27,0.55,6.56,1.64,1.91,1.37,0.27,3.28,1.64,1.09,0.82,0.27,0,4.64,0.27,3.28,0.27,0.82,0,6.83,2.19,12.84,1.37,3.55,2.73,0,7.65,4.64,1.09,4.1,2.19,1.37,0.82,3.01,1.37,0.82,0.27,0.82,1.64,0.27,0,0.27,0.27,0,0.27,0,0,0,0,0,0,11.2,5.19,4.92,0,0,0.55,0,0.27,0,0.27,0,0,0

I know Psychology is where God wants me but I watch guard to be sure taht human s don't think they know everything heck even Freud had some akward ideas about sexual behavior in children people are human God is not that is simple. This 20 minutes is actually very long how can i sit and write this long. WHy am  i listening to 311 right now i mean i got the song yesterday but i didnt think i liked them but i guess they make some good music. These shorts from Foleys are the bomb  they only cost 5 dollars. . they are plaid. Joshua keeps talkin to me and interupting me and hes whacked up. . he is the most judgemental person i have ever met he thinks he can predict the future and it really makes me mad. Hes so certain and hes so wrong and it blows. I did laundry today and it didnt take long but i didnt take anythign with me so it just seemed like forever  You know what is the worst thing ever when girls come to your apartment and steal your dvd's without asking taht is about the worst thing ever.

I  am gay, and I know my answers are very biased. To me, I either strongly  agree or strongly disagree. Hey, it's about my identity and the society  I am living in. I have to, sort like, defend for what I believe in,  although I don't have much choices in picking my own identity. What am I  thinking? Why am I so excited about it? I have come out for a rather long  period of time, yet I am still nervous about the whole issue. I am a very  lucky guy, I have not met a lot resistance from the society as a whole. Somehow, I only have the problem finding the right guy. When I was young,  I have those innocent thoughts about love and romance. I have always  believed that there definitely is a right guy for me. Yeah, that was a huge joke. As I become more mature, I become more practical, just like everyone  else. All right, I shall only speak for myself. I know love to me is a  pathetically realistic concept. No more space for imagination. God, why am  I writing this? I had just promised myself to forget about the existence  of love, right after the Jonathan issue. It shall not work for me. I am too pretentious, arrogant, determined, etc. Anyway, moving on to something else. Man, there are 10 more minutes left. The sky is so dark. I wonder what is  out there. I know one thing is that I am not scared of anything. I want to  know, I want to discover, I want to enjoy life beyond it's practical  dimensions. There is the moon. No, I am lying. The moon is not visible at the beginning of the month. Well, I wish I could see it though. I have  heard enough Chinese stories about the angels on the moon. I hope I can live there sometimes. The earth is too complicated, and it is also very cruel. I just want to go somewhere and forget all the problems and relieve all the  stress. I really just want to be with my closest friends for a little while  and leave everything else alone. Oh, not possible. Why am I writing this. I swear to God that I have never been so senseless before. My fingers are  typing things which my mind cannot direct. Weird, I need help. Maybe this  is the point of this assignment, to get lost and throw away the conscious. Ok, 2 more minutes. What am I going to do this weekend? How about 6th  street. I really like Paradox.

Well I got back from a bible study got to see some people that I haven't seen in a while I suppose it made me feel at home and I actually made plans to hang out with someone I met this summer and haven't been able to see him that much. Anyways I enjoyed it but at the same time I wonder about my relationship with God I suppose it is a thought that always lingers in my mind. Is it strong enough to I pursue him enough am I a good person sometimes I don't know. so I'm listening while I do this music seems to be something that I have always enjoyed the way everything flows together and becomes something more than noise it seems that music in some forms is the perfection of the interpretation of emotions it not only puts words towards your feelings it gives the words syntax by adding in a conglermation of cacophonies that seem to support the words, Now even though some music doesn't appeal to me I believe that if anyone is writing the music backed by emotion and truth or feelings then they have earned my respect if that really means anything but to those who rock you have got my salutations. So lets get real I'm an 18 guy so I do also think about girls quite a bit. Today I thought of a girl in high school I missed and it is always an itching feeling or thought in the back of my head to try to commit to a girl or girlfriend. Even though I don't know what the hell I want to be honest, is that all this world is trying to please ourselves in order to feel worthy, who are we trying to impress. I don't know? but I can't deny my feeling I believe that truth lies in your emotions and that god gives you certain emotions that give you truth in your life. Sometimes I feel that the only thing we have here on this planet is love that's all we have that is really worth any value and if we give it away to others that is the only way to truly fulfill not only yourself but others, Live life love life. So as I continue to right I remind myself that love exist and to give it freely to those who are in my life. I find myself always observing people walking to class its amazing how afraid people are to look at each  other simple glances are rarely seen. what a society it would be if people simply acknowledged each other in life.

NaN,"""""""In the eighteen years of my life I've realized that man is either born without a conscience or with one. I was born with one. In my heart I bleed at the injustices of the world, of the rights taken from humans because they had not the power. What is more distressing comes not from the fact that the injustice is so evident but because of the powerlessness of the victim. I believe that education can free a man. An educated society becomes more aware. It can offer self-esteem, knowledge, influence, and the voice to speak out. It has become my belief that I or anyone else who is willing can make a difference. The conscience in me longs to make a difference. To scream at the top of my lungs, """"""""This is wrong! You are wrong! Give back his rights! Give back what does not belong to you!"""""""" but I know in the bottom of my heart that humans, no matter how hard they may try will never rid the earth of its total harshness, because some men were born with feeling and some without. This gives no excuse for not trying to make a change for the better because with every change, an initiation must begin. Though my eyes see the sorrow of the world, I am a person who strives to look for the positive in people. My first encounter with an individual has me searching and finding his good qualities. More likely I am opt to say something good about a person rather than bad. Within me I feel no intimidation toward others strengths and I take pleasure in finding and praising someone else's gifts. Determination is the driving force of my soul. Being perceptive of other's nature has allowed me to see that it takes more than intelligence to reach a goal. I know only if I want it can be done and within my veins is a spirit that keeps me aiming to reach the top. It seems forever that I have expected highly of myself. With every aspect of my life I feel a certain pull to be the best I can be. Rarely do I accept being less. My love of knowledge and natural curiosity arrives from my need to grasp my world to better understand it. I cannot accept just reading new knowledge. It is utterly important for me to comprehend it as well. This allows me to know the unknown, to conquer all the earth's secrets for I do not like being put in the dark. I must see all things with my eyes, my heart, and my brain. This gives me confidence and strength. Hopefully, I will conquer all my fears, build my character, and use it to make a difference in the world.

NaN,"Well. I just finished my first week of college. I can't believe I'm already here, but I wish I was already out. There seems like so much to do but I'm starting to get things under control. I think. My friend Helen is at A&M and shes going to jump for the track team. She is an emblem of success. everytime I think of her, it reminds me of just how bad of a person I am. I guess everyone makes mistakes, but my mistakes seem to be a lot worse when I make them, because I know better. Hopefully  I can keep up with all my reading assignments. reading is definitely not my thing. especially when I'm forced to do it. Tomorrow's reading time will be flled with the SI class, but that's okay I think I'm going to need as much help as I can get. Tonite's church. thank the Lord. Sometimes you just got to get filled up when everything seems so dry. I love church, but sometimes I feel so . . I don't know. not as good as everyone else. like nobody makes mistakes but me. I know that's not true. only I lie from the devil trying to get me down. anyways today in psychology class someone mentioned obessive cumplusive disorders. and I wanted to scream out. I've been caught in that trap beofre. Which I have and thank the Lord I no longer am bound by that chain. only by the grace of God did I get through some of the worst, tearful, confusing years of my life. Oh. El Patio sounds real good right now. not only because of the delicious food, but because I have to right a paper on it and I need to get some intricate details to make my paper a success! I can't wait to be home tonite. I've been up at school since before 7 am. only to realize that my 8 am class had been canceled. my next class was not until 12 noon. Oh well at least I got some studying in and I was able to finish my english homework so that I wouldn't have any tonite. Praise the Lord. Anyways back tonite. my boyfriend is suppose to call me about ten. man I hope he gets his own phone soon. I miss him. I wish could just get married right now. but my father might have other plans for that situation. . but I don't understand sometimes. why do you always have to wait 'til your outa school before you get married. . of course I understand the logical part of it all, but what about love. although love is suppose to be patient. I don't like preaching to myself all the time. it's like I know what's right but I wish things could be different. I don't know. right now my biggest concern is my dad letting me drive down to San Antonio and pick up Stephen (my boyfriend) on friday afteroon. oh Lord please help",stream of consciousness,0,1,502,9.84,14.34,81.27,16.73,12.75,0,12.75,0.8,1.2,2.79,0.2,3.39,12.95,1,4.58,2.99,0.6,0.8,1.59,0.2,0,0.4,10.96,1.2,2.39,4.38,0.6,4.38,1,1.2,0.6,0.4,0.2,5.58,0.8,2.79,0.6,0.4,0.4,5.58,2.19,17.33,1.59,2.79,1.2,0.6,2.39,4.38,0.6,3.78,2.39,0,1.39,0.6,0.4,0.2,0,0,0,1.79,1.79,0,0.8,0.2,0.6,0.2,0,0,0,0,0.8,17.13,10.36,1.99,0,0,0,0.2,0,0,3.98,0.4,0.2,0

NaN,"As I sit in this room, in this computer lab, I hear all the different sounds around me. The computer is humming and somebody is opening a pack of some type of food. I also can't help but notice that this keyboard clicks loudly as I type. I've never tracked my thoughts before and this is actually kind of fun. My eyes are feeling very small because more than anything, I would love to take a nap. This day was pretty long. I hope this weekend is extra long and productive for me. I'm feeling so tired! I would love to just get up under my comforter and stuff my three pillows in the corner and chill out. I don't believe how small my eyes are feeling right now. I know when I go back to my dorm room though my room mate is going to beg me to go to dinner with her but I ate way too much today and I am not in the least bit hungry. Not to mention that the food smells kind of nasty. I wish I was home at these moments to eat some real food, but it's nice to be away from home also. I hope that my boyfriend will come and visit me this weekend. It would be great to see him again though it really hurts when he leaves. Seeing him makes me miss him more but I guess I should enjoy our time together. I wish he went to this school or at least lived in Austin then we wouldn't have this long distance problem. He seems to think it is ok and the distance factor is not of any importance to him. I don't believe him when he says that. I wonder if he is as committed as he says he is. I am pretty sure he is especially after all that we have been through. I hope we can make it for the next few years but who knows what will happen? I wonder what will happen with us since long distance relationships are not supposed to last long. I think I'd be the one to influence that stereotype the most because I'm the one in a college setting and he's in the same environment in which we established ourselves. I do love him though. It'd be nice to be in my room talking to him and laying on my bed. dosing off and falling asleep. Tonight is Thursday night. This is a good night because I have no obligations to do any homework for this night other than this. I should have done this assignment earlier but of course I always wait for the last minute. But technically this isn't the last minute because its not Friday yet, and it is early evening. Tonight I want to do nothing but relax!

NaN,"I am so excited about being down at UT but now I realize what everyone meant when they said that it is hard to study at UT. I have been out every night this week because there is so much going on. Luckily, I have still kept up with my school work and have been to every class. This week is the only week that I am going to go out every night but I have just had so much fun. There is a guy that I met when I came down here my junior year in high school and we completely hit it off. I am looking forward to seeing him again. I absolutely love the classes that I am taking right now. It is refreshing to go to a class where the students and professors are excited to be there and excited to learn. The material has been interesting and I can't wait to get started in my business honors classes. I am having some roommate problems right now, though. One of my roommates is incredibly messy, stays out all night every night and gets very drunk. I need to talk to her about this problem before it gets too big so maybe I will take her to lunch this weekend. Saturday at the game I get to sit in a box and I am so excited. The last game was fun but it was at night and I was burning up so I can only imagine how an afternoon game would be. Thankfully I will be in air conditioned rooms with free food and drinks. I really like the guy I am going with. Not as a boyfriend but as a really good friend. He is a gentleman and really looks out for me. Last night I met this really cute guy and he kissed me but I found out this morning that he has a serious girlfriend that goes to TCU- what a jerk! I am very mad that he put me in this awkward position. I thought he was so nice and such a gentleman last night but that just goes to show you. You really can not trust freshmen guys- they are only after one thing. I am still getting adjusted to college life and it does take some adjusting. I really do miss my mom and my house. The food at Hardin House is so gross and I hate to eat it. I know that I am going to gain the freshman fifteen. This year is my sisters debutante season and when I go home I am going to have to go to tons of parties and everyone is going to notice that I ahve gained weight and they will all be looking for it. But I have been working out everyday and trying to watch what I eat but there is always candy and good food sitting out around the rooms and I always end up grabbing a handful. But, life is short.

NaN,or january when her fiance gets back from Germany with the VISA. Hes really cool too. I just got really happy because my boyfreind just sent me a message saying he was home but i had to say be right back so i could write more about him. He is the last thing i think about when i go to bed and of course i dream about him and hes the first thing i think about when i wake up. Another thing that is really neat about our relationship is that we do a bible study and devotional together every day. It really helps up to grow closer to eachother and to God who is number 1 in our relationship. My Christianity is really important to me. I was raisedin a Christian home and brought up in church. I am so greatful for my parents and all that they have taught me. They are also still married and i consider myself very lucky to have them since most people now are not as fortunate to have thier parents still together. Me and my mom are very close and i tell her a lot. We have a very open relationship and can depend on eachother for anything. She even gets these gut type feelings about things for example when I started dating David and he spent some time here at the house she told me one night that   she had a good feeling about this one.  meaning she really liked him and could see this relatioship lasting a long time. And so far she is right and i don't see her being wrong any time soon. I am glad that i still live at home while i am going to UT because I don't know where i would be without her. I am not very independent but i am working on that because i know i can not live at home forever. The good thing about living at home besides free food an laundry is that my boyfriend also lives at home with his parents and he only lives like 5 minutes or less from me.,stream of consciousness,0,1,355,19.72,12.39,82.54,17.18,9.86,1.13,10.99,0,5.63,1.69,0,3.66,11.27,1.41,2.82,2.54,1.13,0.28,0.28,0,0,0,6.2,1.41,3.38,1.41,0,3.1,1.69,2.25,0.56,1.13,0.56,10.42,1.41,6.76,0.56,1.13,0.28,4.79,3.1,10.99,0.56,2.82,1.41,0,7.61,3.66,0.85,1.41,0.85,0.28,0.56,3.1,3.1,0,0,0,0.28,1.41,1.41,0,0.85,0.28,0,0,0.85,0,0,0,0.28,5.63,5.07,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.56,0,0,0

Well,  one way, actually, was to say that this one time I had a conversation with my teacher about  whether people thought in complete sentences or not.

I wonder if that's simply because of the temperature of the room or that stress  stuff Dr. Pennebaker was talking about. Well the temperature used to be just fine, and now it's  cold all of the sudden. We have to call those eminence guys. They came last week and fixed  our toilet in like 10 seconds. We didn't even see them, we just heard them. I was joking with  my roommate that God came and fixed our toilet. God rocks. ha-ha I have a black t-shirt that  says that in white letters. It's my old youth group t-shirt. I designed it. I'm quite proud of that. It was cool and promoted God. One guy once came up to me and asked me if it was being  sarcastic. that wasn't cool. He felt bad after asking though, he said he didn't mean to be rude. I believe him. He was a cool guy in several of my classes. His name was Charlie. There was  this other guy named Charlie, too. He worked in the Emergency Room at the hospital where I  used to do my clinical rotations for school. He was really cool too. Actually me and my friend,  Erin, that got along with him really well kept in touch with him. She just saw him recently at the  mall with his kids, and he told her some details about a friend of ours that died about three  weeks ago. He was in the emergency room when it happened. She was in a car accident and  died almost instantly. It was pretty sad, but it didn't really affect me personally because she  wasn't that close to me. However, my OA during orientation reminded me a lot of her, and  that's kind of eerie. I say a guy that was an OA this summer at school last week. That guy was  the one that stood out the most to me because he was the nicest looking. (Not as in attractive,  as in sincerely nice. )  Some people have that effect on me sometimes. Like recently I went to  Hawaii and the guy that was the scuba diving instructor was named Jimmy. Jimmy was really  cool, and he had that effect on me. He just seemed like a sincerely nice guy.

It would be really nice to have a new computer, this one is old and outdated and the internet connection is really slow. I am tired of always having to listen to my brother and his girlfriend bicker and yell at each other, they are like two little kids every waking hour I'm with them they are constantly harassing each other. My computer monitor is really small. It makes looking at my screen for extended periods of time like this hurt my eyes. College life is really not what I expected. I'm constantly feeling homesick and want to go back to Houston. I guess I just need to get acclimated to Austin and college life once I do I'm sure I will enjoy it very much but until then I will attempt to go back to Houston as much as possible. Luckily a lot of my friends also attend UT, they are definitely making the transition more bearable. Every one of my classes has over 100 people in them. This is a big change from my 20 people honors classes in high school. It doesn't really allow me to make relationships with my professors. Raquetball was really fun. I ran smack into the wall with my shoulder and it still hurts but its a good pain one of those pains that reminds you that you accomplished something fun and physically strenuous. Yeah I don't think I spelled that word correctly. I'll have to look it up in the dictionary when I am done. Is this assignment done yet? No still 13 and a half minutes to go. This is the first time I've ever written a stream of consciousness. I know there is some famous novel or documentary our there where there is like a 17 page stream of consciousness containing only a single sentence. I think its title has the world Ullyses or it is written by a Ullyses or something. I know this because my father appraised me of it. Just useless trivia I guess. I enjoy watching trivia games on TV, mainly stuff like Who Wants to be a Millionaire or Jeopardy. But maybe that's just because normally there isn't anything else on. The World Series of Poker is enjoyable to watch as well. I was initially really sceptical about writing this stream of consciousness because I didn't really know how it would turn out or how easy it would be to write, but now that I'm half way through it things are just sort appearing on the page. Definitely not what I expected. I have to say this is the most interesting writing assignment I think I have ever had. Whew only 8 minutes to go.

These aren't any old artificial neural networks though, they're growth modeled. (my idea). So I hope this new batch of data continues to support my hypothesis. The rhythmic clicking of the keys is kind of distracting. It reminds me of our last psych class, when the girl I sat by thought that if you could type faster than you could write, it was pretty fast. I really disagree. Writing free hand is an extremely slow process, typing goes much faster because the letters are formed instantly when you hit the key. You can't program as fast as you can type so it really doesn't matter for me except in word processing like this, where I need to be able to type as fast as I can or I can't remember what I was thinking.

NaN,"""""""I haven't been in the mood to do any homework. I find it very hard just to sit down and study. As a Freshmen, I have found many new experiences in the past week. Finally getting my email hooked up, I received my mail that has been sitting in my inbox for about a week. My good friend from home wrote me from South West. She informed me of great news. She is having a ball at her new school. She is on the drill team, and making many new friends. Which leads me to about one o'clock yesterday(sunday). As I came home from church, I was excited to see that I had two messages all for me! :)  The first one is from a friend who attends UT. The other was from my best friend, who sadly is going to another college in Wacol. We could only talk for about fifteen minutes, which wasn't enough time. However, it was long enough so I could hear all about the great time she is having with all of her new friends. Which leads me to the point that I am feeling terribly lonely. I don't mean to sound jealous of my friends good fortunes, but I am envious. See, I came to UT because I didn't want to go to A&M because my brother went there. UT and A&M were the only two schools which I applied. Truthfully, I am not too excited about coming here. However, I don't want to go to A&M. It's so secluded and a good two hours farther from home. Anyway, so I moved up here and moved into an apartment because my mom thinks dorms are too loud. So I have a roommate who is twenty and she does her own stuff and is hardly home!  I am always here all by myself. I have a total of four friends up here. One of which, Heather, I spent all of my senior year bickering with because she never seemed to respect my religious views. She knows how to get under my skin. However, we are closer than any of my other friends up here. Which leads to the final three. Lindsey goes to St. Edwards, and is so homesick. She misses her boyfriend and her mother, which is understandable. Katie is a nice and wonderful, but we haven't spent too much time together, and Sandra. Sandra I've known since the seventh grade and didn't talk to her much my junior and senior years. You see her and Lindsey are best friends and they got in a fight their junior year and stopped talking, so me being the insincere person which I am takes Lindsey's side. My reasoning was because I thought Sandra was inconsiderate of others needs. You see, I had every single class with her our Sophomore year, and we kind of got tired of each other. So back to the present. I don't really know anybody, and I am bad at meeting people because I don't know what to say.

NaN,"I love my girlfriend leah. She is so awesome. I love her big butt and her hair, I love her tongue and her smile. Man oh man does she give good hand jobs. Almost as good as sex. ALMOST. there are some things I don't like about her though. She is a tiny bit chubby but it doesn't really bother me that much. She is stubborn and that at times gets on my nerves. I also worry that she is a shopaholic. and that if we do get married one day that she will spend too much of our income. I wonder what I will be doing 5 years from now. it would be so awesome to be a country music station radio dj. I think the prime time for me would have to be like at lunch time. I believe that would be best, cause then I could stay up late still and sleep in a little later. the rush hour traffic time would be awesome too. I would have fun being the dj in the morning, but I would hate the hours. I mean whoa, not my kind of lifestyle. I also wonder if being a personal trainer is going to work out. I haven't been really an active gym goer. I need to start doing that. I am trying to think of what would be a good time to go. on mondays I could go right after class at 5, same thing goes for wednesdays. on tuesdays, thursdays and fridays, I should probably go right after Spanish, because then after I am done I could go eat something, that would probably kill two birds with one stone because of the fact that I wouldn't have to eat before I go to Spanish then. I could probably focus on cardio type stuff on monday, Wednesday and friday. and then weight train on tuesday and Thursday. maybe I should do the opposite. cause then I could work my muscles more and they do say u lose weight by working out, plus on mondays and wednesdays it will be harder to do cardio at that time since it will be so crowded at that time. now about tennis. I really hope I can get to play on the real courts and not have to go to intermural courts just to practice. I should go check that out tomorrow along with all the other things I need to do. it would be cool if leah and sara came to UT next year, unfortunetly I don't see that happening when it comes to leah. I wonder how long I should wait before proposing. I think waiting til at least my junior year would be best. because then at least my parents will see that we are in a serious relationship.

NaN,"My cell phone gets horrible reception here. It is hard to talk to my boyfriend back in plano cause he always breaks up. He's not really my boyfriend anymore, but he really is. I don't think that makes sense. Ten more minutes. so. my nails are shiny I'm tired of doing this. I don't get why we are doing this either. If mine is this long and there about 300 people in each class and say there are about 5 classes, that's 1,5000 papers. Nobody probably reads this. It is probably random spot reading if anything so this will get submitted and overlooked so I don't really see a point in this I wonder if everybody has around the same stream of conscience. I bet a lot of people are writing about how they have to do this assignment and they don't see a point to it really. I don't know what I want to be when I grow up. I wanto to make a lot of money. I was gooing to do psychology but everybody is doing it. 1 out of 3 people I ask are a psychology major. It is very interesting and I loved it in highschool, but future wise there's not much you can do with it as I see it. There is a teacher or a psychologist or maybe a social worker. And if 1 out of 3 people are doing it at UT and there is about 50,000 people, wells that's about 17,000 pyschologists and teachers alone from UT, there is still to mention Tech, and other schools where most people are doing psychology too. I think everyopne should take psychology though. but I think way too many people are majoring in it. Actually, I think majoring in it fine so that way you can get an extensive look at how human nature and the mind functions, but I think that knowledge should be applied to other fields. SO everyone should study pyschology, but not pursue a field in it. I really want to be a person who does case studies on dreams. I think dreams are so interesting. I had a dream about Roseanne the show and that I met the cast. It's really weird. I remebr thinking I should get their autographs so I can put it up on my wall. Sometimes, though, I think people see too much into dreams. I think people on drugs have deep dreams, or maybe they are having reaaly   fake   dreams. Like their brain is just so confused it is just sending randome imAages. I don't now. I think drugs let ypou tap into another side of your brain. I think they can open your mind. I think drugs like X can open your mind, but I think that you should learn how to open your mind without drugs. I think no one should do drugs on a regular basis. I wonder if a lot of philosophy and psychology teachers have done drugs.

NaN,"ok, at this very moment, I'm am in pain, emotionally. Yesterday, I had a bad experience. I saw my best friend kiss the girl that he knew that I had a certain attraction too. It really really hurt, but I have gotten over it. I can't really get mad at either one because first of all, we meet the girl at a club on Saturday night/ Sunday morning and two, my friend is a little more wild and social so he was talking twice as much than I was. The girl called me herself last night, but I told her that I didn't want to talk to her anymore because I had lost interest in her. As for my friend, he told me that he was really really sorry, yet he hasn't come up to me yet to show his forgiveness. I'm ok with it, I just don't understand how something like this could happen. I'm in question though, I don't know if I should be mad or not?  I think of one way, which is that I shouldn't let something stupid like this ruin a long, good friendship between my friend and I, or, if it was right to begin with that my friend kissed the girl that I liked after I had told him that I liked her. N E ways, good thing its all over and I'm moving once again with my life. I try not to let this things interfere with my everyday school life but at its impossible to keep them apart. For example, I could not concentrate all day yesterday because I was thinking of what had happened. I didn't read, I didn't do my homework, which is a very very bad thing. The good thing though is that I got over it and I'm back to normal. I guess its just one of those weird once in a while incidences. Today has been a much more productive day then yesterday. I went to go see what color band I would get for the ticket raffle of the Texas vs. OU game. Unfortunately, I got the pink band, which is the least likely to have a chance to get a ticket. No worries, I wasn't really planning to go to that game, I just went to get the band because two of my friends asked me to go get it. I have a glow in the dark stars type of theme here in my room. I had never had the chance to have some in high school, so I finally did in college, and I just noticed that one of the very big stars fell off and is on the floor. I am looking at it this very moment, wondering why I'm not getting up and putting it back in its place. I also have the glow in the dark feet. My roommates, who are like really cool back from home friends say I'm a dork for having the stars, but none the less, I could careless on what they have to say because",stream of consciousness,0,1,510,20.4,9.8,83.73,17.25,11.57,0.2,11.76,0,2.75,3.14,0.39,5.88,12.55,1.96,5.69,2.94,0.59,0.39,2.75,0.2,0.59,0.39,7.45,1.57,2.16,2.55,0.2,2.35,1.96,2.94,0.98,1.76,0.2,9.02,2.35,2.94,1.76,0,0.78,4.31,7.25,10.2,0.2,2.75,1.76,0.2,5.88,3.73,1.18,1.76,0.98,0,0.78,1.96,0.78,0.39,0.2,0.59,0,0,0,0,0.78,0.39,0.39,0,0,0,0,0,0.59,14.12,4.71,5.88,0,0,0.2,0,0,0,3.14,0,0.2,0

It just happens that those two that I saw today were also some of the cutest and most popular guys that I know. Lucky me!  This gum that I'm chewing is from a blow pop that I finished a few minutes ago, and it is already losing its flavor. Those things never last long at all. I have a problem with one of my classes. see, I swam all throughout junior high and highs school, and I want to continue in college, but every time I want to do something, the class is in the way. I've already changed the time once, but it still causes conflicts. That is very stressful. I don't know if I should change it to an early time because then, I would have to take a shower in between classes, and it might be a pain. But then at least I'd have time to go to my sorority meetings and all the fun parties and stuff. But would I have time to take my regular naps in between my classes like I usually do?  No, I don't think I would. Let's see. which is more important?  I guess more things will come up in the evenings than in the mornings, so it might be better to change to that early time. I just don't know. WOw, I have like nine minutes left. THis isn't such a bad assignment. Psychology is actually really fun. I've only been to two classes, but the professor is really funny and definitely keeps my attention, which is hard to do for an hour and a half. I hope the tests aren't too hard, though, because I'm not that great at analyzing and stuff.

NaN,"I just got done taking a shower in the hopes that it would wake me up so I could read the things I need to read for my classes. The shower sure did wake me up! A girl living on my floor, whom I have never seen before, took all the best shower, along with all the hot water. So it took me twice as long to take a shower, which made me mad. This anger added onto my frustration from my homework tonight. So now I am here, listening to music and writing my   stream of consciousness   because I figured that this would be the best time since I have multiple feelings in me right now. In addition to the anger from the shower incident and the frustration from the class homework assignments, my friend brought up a topic that made me recall past emotions. He recently is   taking a break   with his girlfriend, and he has been telling me that he is sad and lonely, but the break was mutual. I told him,   yeah, I know what you mean. I had to end things with a guy, but it was not mutual.  So instead of just acknowledging it and moving on, he asked questions about my relationship with this past guy. It took me a long time to forget the experiences dealing with him. Talking about them just made me a little sad. Like I said, the break was really bad, so bad that I felt like there was no one who could understand what I was going through, no one could help me because this was the way my life situation is and no one can fix it. Strict parents cannot be changed on their beliefs. Anyway, I tried to shrug the subject away by bringing up other topics, and soon enough we were laughing over some dumb internet site that he sent to me. If only I could help him out with his sadness, but I know time is all he needs to realize that this girl he's been with is not the only girl out there. A   break   from a relationship will either make the bond stronger, or one will come to the realization that a world of opportunity is out there. I am content that I have no one tying me down, but I do miss the boyfriend/girlfriend relationship. If I do meet someone, then that is fine. If I do not, then that is fine too. When I entered college I promised myself that I would make smart, sensible decisions and still have fun in the process. A huge group of guy friends is way better than one boyfriend in my opinion. I have not even met at least five new people in all of my classes for crying out loud!   There are plenty of fish in the sea.  Yes, college is great so far; I recently joined kung fu.

NaN,"Im sitting in my room at the towers, and I have to admitt that the room size isnt half bad, ecspecially compared to my older sisters dorm room when she was a freshman. However I do have one complaint, and that is that the room are not taken care of in the least bit. And if I had to approximate the last time this place was renovated, my honest guess would be nineteen ninety-one. Yet I can live with a rather filthy room, but the worst part about living in the Towers has to be the food. The cooks here should go down in the Guiness Book of World Records for being the first people ever to make chicken taste bad. And everytime I go in there i seem to be asking the cook what exactly the food sitting in front of me is. Which through my experience translates into something that is not a good thing. As I look around my room I can't help but notice the fact that my side is far more messy than my roomates, but to be honest this is no concern of mine. Because he eats all of my food. I went pot luck in the towers for my roomates, which means that my rooming assignment is totally random. I havent really decided what my true feelings about my new roomates are due to the fact that we havent really spent time together. This fact is more my fault than it is theirs', because for one thing I am in pledgeship right now so finding time to spend with people is like finding a needle in a haystack. But every once in a while I do get to spend a little time with them, and from those few experiences I can say that Tony, the guy with whom I share a room with, is a very nice person and I believe that we will get along very well. So far the one thing that has kind of tied us together is that fact that we have the same taste in music, which is a major relief to me. My other two roomates who live across the living room from me are both going through pledge ship. And Campbell has been really nice as well, though he seems rather reserved. Yet the one guy that I am not to fond of at this time is my third roomate Joey. Its not that there is hostility between us its just that I try to be as nice as possible to him and try to start conversations with him every time I get yet he just won't seem to respond. Maybe its just a difference in the way we were brought up or something. Because I know when I was in high school this new guy moved in from Chicago and he really kept to himself along with his parents.

NaN,"""""""Well, I suppose since this is a stream of consciousness exercise I will just say whatever is on my mind, which at the moment happens to be how incredibly horrible this past weekend was. But, let's back up and get the basics down. For graduation, my grandparents promised to buy me a new computer. New, being the operative word. So they told me to go find one that I liked and tell them where it was. My mother and I went out and looked at computers and found a nice setup that included a printer for about $1500. We thought that sounded reasonable, so we informed my grandparents of the computer's location and they said it sounded good. HOWEVER, they went to see my Uncle's family in Dallas for my cousin's birthday and decided to go a cheaper route and not buy a namebrand computer. So I ended up with this piece of crap that keeps shutting down on me. My Dad has been freaking out for the past two weeks how he knew all along we should have gotten a different computer in the first place and how my grandparents always go the cheaper route even when it means less quality and now my entire college career is jeopardized because I cannot get online. So I spent Saturday messing with my computer, trying to reinstall stuff to see if it was a software problem. It wasn't. My Uncle drove in from Dallas on Sunday and took Windows off, reinstalled it, deleted my C drive (which is a big deal), then created a new one and repartitioned it, Everything SEEMED to work for a brief period of time before my computer decided to do one more mad little dance of irony and shut itself down. Now I am stuck with a computer that doesn't even partially compute and my Dad has to come pick it up to take it to some store called """"""""Computer Doctor"""""""" and meanwhile he's still ranting about how he was right all along and my Mother should talk my grandparents into getting me a new computer, and if they don't how my parents should because if they don't I'm going to flunk because after all everything is online nowadays, etc. So I wasted my weekend sitting up in my room with my family when I could have been in the music room practicing. And I'm a music major, not computer science, so the music building is where I should be. But my mother wouldn't let me go to the music building because she wanted me to be around while they were messing with my computer. So I didn't practice AT ALL this weekend when my professor says I should practice 4 hours a day at least, and I just got a bunch of new music and now I'm totally screwed for my lesson on Friday.

I'm not really anti-social. just a bit shy and cautious about who I talk to. I think that's a good thing. However, it can be very lonely. My wrists hurt. I wonder if my brother is having fun at home. probably not. Lol. He never seems to be having fun when he's alone. Aww. Now I feel bad for leaving him. Maybe he'll be encouraged to invite his friends over to hang out or something. I don't want him to be all lonely like I was as a junior in high school. .

He's my hero. Hahaha. I'm glad he kind of knows what he wants to do, because I sure don't. I'm torn between wanting something that will be lucrative and people will really need, and doing something that I looooove to do with all my heart. I've found, thru various high school experiences and the first year long relationship, that I can learn to love almost anything. which is a bad thing. I have no idea what I'm really good at and have no idea exactly how to find out. I already feel like I'm running out of time right now as I sit here typing out a required assignment. It's crazy. And frustrating. And I don't' want to try to do too many things at once, because that is what caused my uber-dramatic downfall my senior year. Okay. Maybe it wasn't a downfall. But it did make me realize some stuff about being human that you would think I'd know already, having been a human for almost 19 years. Silly me. Oh well. It won't happen again here, because I'm not in Baytown and I'm away from people that drag me down.

NaN,"Right now I have a flood of emotions coming down on me. Maybe I'm just to sensitive. I feel that I close myself up when I'm around my friends. Why I do, I do not know. There are some friends of mine that I can just relax and worry about what they think of me. My other friends, I just do not know. It's not just that, but when I am around a group of certain people, I can not open myself to them. The reason why, is that in the past, when I have opened myself to people, they turn on me or talk bad about me. I am very sensitive to things of that matter. I do not want people to think of me as being snobbish or stuck up when I do not talk to them. I act kind of quiet around boys because in the past, boys have now always been nice to me. Things have changed since junior high and high school, but still I have to watch my back. Who knows what they say or think about me. I need to stop being so selfconscious about myself and be more confident about myself. I think I am a nice person and I am openminded about certain things. I feel that if someone wants to talk to me, then I will be there to listen. Whatever they tell me will be held in confidence and not told to anyone if they ask me not too. I still would not tell anyone what they told me even if they did not say so. The reason why is that I do not think it is anybody's business. Well, I do feel that there are good qualities about me and some bad ones too. We are not perfect. Humans have their little flaws here and there. I will admit to my flaws. There are some that I am embarrassed to admit which means I need to work on them. Speaking about working, I need to work out. I worked out only once this week, and I need to work out more. Over the summer, I worked out almost everyday. Well not exactly, but each day was a potential day to work out. It was either school, work, or other emergencies that came up that prevented me from keeping up with my workout schedule. Even so, I still got my three to six times a week that I wanted to get. My clothes are fitting better now, which proves that working out this summer did contribute to my slimming down. Still, I have some more work to go. It's not just having a great figure, it is about being in good health, which we all need to be. I have noticed that after working out, my asthmas is not as bad, and I have not been as sick as I was in the past. Exercise and a good diet works.

NaN,"My first thought is that this assignment is akward. This assignment is not the traditional type of work that I have done in any of my classes. But I am extremely relieved that this assignment is not difficult. I just have to write for twenty minutes straight without stopping or doing anything else. I can't believe that the weekend just came and went. It seemed like I was in class just hours ago, looking forward to the weekend. Now, Monday is already here. The long week of classes stares right in my face. But I don't like concentrating on the negative parts of life. I like to be happy; therefore, I think happy thoughts.   I am glad that the UT football team beat Rutgers. I sure didn't miss sitting in the firey heat at the stadium!  I'm glad the team is doing well. I can't exactly say that about Ricky Williams and his NFL debut on Sunday. He did okay; 40 yards in 10 rushes. That's an average of four yards per carry. But he hurt his ankle. Again!  I really think he just needs to rest up and play when there is no pain at all. I know he is a tough guy, and it must be really tough for him to sit out a game. I am just like that, except I don't get paid millions and millions of dollars to play sports!     In other sports-related news, the Houston Astros have won ten games in a row. I am really happy about that. It looks like the 'stros will be making the post-season for the third straight year. The team looks good on paper. I have high hopes, but at the same time, I do not want to be disappointed if they lose. I probably won't even worry about the play-off games too much. I will be too busy in college!   Speaking of college, I need to find me a girlfriend. This really does mean a lot to me. But at the same time, I don't want a girlfriend just to have one. I want a special one. But those are hard to find. I guess I just need to be patient and wait for that right girl to walk into my life. But I really do get lonely sometimes. That part of my heart will always be empty. That's life though; I have to learn to deal with my discomforts. Looking for a girlfriend, it doesn't help that I'm butt-ugly!  I know that my personality is great, but women aren't looking for that nowadays. They want a good looking guy. Actually, women want that good-looking guy who is extremely nice and has a great personality. Unfortunately in life, guys are either handsome or have a good personality. It's hard to find a guy with both of those characteristics. Me, I'm the good personality guy. I have faith in God, and I will leave this matter in God's hands. I guess I ended up negative anyway.

In fact, it would be a good thing. It's pretty hot outside today. I have a horrible crick in my neck. Almost like I've been looking in the same direction for ages and never had my hinges oiled. When I look to the left, it all seems to go away. Perhaps I should start sitting on the other side of the classrooms. I should start studying more often. I passed my Computer Proficiency Test today. not like I was terribly worried about it though. I had my first quiz at UT today as well. I ended up reading for my Financial Accounting class for an hour and a half at the AIM reading room at the school of business. I did a few homework problems at the end, but didn't finish them. If I would have been reading for my MIS class, I probably would have been prepared for the quiz. It's pretty straightforward stuff though--especially with me being a certified Microsoft and Citrix network administrator. My roommate Chad has been really sketchy lately. I think it has to do with the fact that we moved in together as 'eligible bachelors' after both breaking up from serious relationships. DAMN, those Italian herbs smell really good. It's making my mouth start to water really bad. I took a painting class last semester and did a few works -- one of them is sitting on my desk and keeps catching my attention. I also have a double Dave's cup on my desk -- which is one of my favorite places to eat. I think I'm going to turn some music on now [empty thoughts] I'm now listening to the sound of 311 (their self titled album to be more specific) I wonder if you all will actually read these. My thought pattern seems to have become more spaced out since I've started listening to the music. Oop--now it's picking up again. I have a stack of CD's on top of my monitor. Do you?  Do you have a stack of anything?  I once saw a stack of hay at my friends ranch. The code to their ranch was 1991, because that's the year they purchased it. The funny thing is, he now incorporated that number plus the first initial of him, his mom, his dad, and his two dogs into being his screen name. This sucks that the time is going by so slowly. At first it seemed to pass by really quickly--with the lines of text slowly appearing, but the time going by in increments of 30 seconds. The spaghetti is ready.

With nothing to say or write about. This has never been a problem before. In high school, there was never silence. Maybe I was always too busy to hear the silence. Now, it's a part of my life. At certain times last year, I could hear it. Weird, seeing how it was my freshman year in college. This year is my second year and I seem to hear nothing but silence. I am still involved in the same activities as last year. Perhaps, it's a sign that I'm finally growing up. Another weird concept. I am thinking that I like silence. Deep down, I do believe that I am a loner. In high school, who would have thought? A loner should be lonely, right? But I am not lonely nor am I ever bored. I like to do things by myself. I think that's it. I don't need anyone. I don't need companionship nor do I need to be felt needed. Awww. to much of the word, """"""""need"""""""". No more. I am happy. I am content. I am selfassured. I told my mom once that I was a loner, but I can't remember what she said. I don't think she even responded to me. Funny thing though. I know I want to be married someday. Now, how would a loner accomplish something like that? I socialize very little these days. My mind is always on school and my studies. I just want that medical acceptance letter in my hands. That is all that counts. Well, not all. My family counts too. They mean more to me than anything. My little brother is here at UT. (he's no longer little anymore) I'm hoping he enjoys his first year.

I think they're closed though. my shoulders have been hurting lately. my neck really hurts too. my neck just started today. but my shoulders have been hurting for a while. usually after sitting in a class after an hour. I need to move around more or something I guess. my hands are freezing cold. there's no thermostat in my room so it's always freezing. and coming in from a hot day it feels good but waking up in the morning it is freezing cold and I can't stand it. I put up another bulletin board over my bed and some push lights on the ceiling over my bed. one of the push lights came off last night or the other night and I put it up again so hopefully it all stays up. there were already some damages to the ceiling so I guess I won't be charged for anything. the sticky things that aren't supposed to mess up walls messed up the ceiling some. but I don't think it matters. oh well. I have some pictures of mariko up on my bulletin boards around the rooms. some on the bulletin board over my bed. I like waking up with pictures of mariko right there. I miss her so much. I hope she had a good day today. last night she didn't seem to be talking too much but she was doing a lot of homework. I don't know. sometimes she just goes through phases.

NaN,"""""""stream of consciousness. Somewhat reminiscent of william faulkner's """"""""A Light in August""""""""  we read that nnovel in my senior AP English class and although iit was a touch on the  boring side at the beginning, it proved to be quite an interesting story. Well I'm in my  dorm rightnow and there is this ceaseless squeaking noise coming from the refrigerator  that always is loudest at the most inconvenient times. I. E: when I'm trying to take a  nap. Our refrigerator is in the closet. It was in the middle of the room, but my roommate  moved it into the closet and put our television in the middle of the room instead. My  roommate's name is Ricky and he's been out of town this weekend as far as I can tell. He  kind of just didn't come home on friday night so my assumption is that he's visiting his  family. I think he's from Laredo, but I could be mistaken. Ricky is dating a girl named  Natalie and the most distinct thing about him is his cologne. Because it smells like crap!  Which sucks, because it's a really expensive Dolce and Gabbana or however you spell it. It  really is terrible because it's like the stink of the cologne is like a glue and has stuck to  everything in our room. Especially all my clothes, which has made me start to smell like  him. Oh I hate it. I always want to say something, but it would be weird saying to him that  his designer cologne smells like ass and that I could make the scent personally with some  onions and curry. God! I've been kind of looking around for a church these past couple of  weeks, but haven't exactly found one. Well I found one on guadalupe, but haven't looked at  what the times are for mass or whatever. My dad is really pushing me to start going to  church because in the last few years he's become somewhat of a Jesus freak. He's not bad,  but it just seems that his faith has made him so condemning of so many things. For  instance, I joined a fraternity and he wants nothing to do with it; refuses to help pay for it  simply because he doesn't like fraternities. But he doesn't exactly say why. And since he's  never been in one I don't see how he can make such a judgement. Oh well, my dad and I  went camping this weekend. We like rock climbing so we were planning on going to a  place called Reimer's Ranch. So we found a new camp site called Krause Springs and it  was really nice. So we camped there with a fire and the whole 9 yards or whatever. But  me and my dad shared a tent and iit was so hot in there and he snored so loud that I took  the plastic rain cover",stream of consciousness,0,1,483,16.1,13.66,77.85,15.11,5.59,1.66,7.25,0.21,4.14,1.86,0,6.83,10.97,0.83,2.48,0.83,0,0.21,1.66,0,0.62,0,7.87,2.48,1.04,2.69,0.41,2.48,1.45,3.11,0.83,1.45,0.21,9.52,1.66,6.21,0.41,0.83,0.21,4.14,4.76,10.14,0.62,3.31,0.83,0,7.04,4.97,1.66,2.48,1.66,0.41,0.41,1.86,1.86,0,0.21,0,0.41,1.04,1.04,0,0.41,0.21,0,0,0.21,0,0.62,0,1.45,15.11,5.59,2.28,0.21,0.21,0,0.41,0,2.28,4.14,0,0,0

There are some people passing by me and I keep looking over wishing for some reason that I recognized them or that they went to my high school. my eating pattern since I got to college has taken a weird pattern-back to my no breakfast-I have 14 meal tickets back at the dorm but a lot of times I will only use 5-10 of my meals a week and that is being generous. the first week I had 10 meals left, last week I had 6 or 7 meals left. I am trying to get my brother to come to towers and eat with me, he can use one of my tickets but he won't come because 2 years ago he got kicked out of towers and I guess he is afraid of going back. somebody must have really scared him or something because fear or boundaries are not usually things that get in edward's way. he has no problem breaking rules or trespassing or anything like that if he wants something or wants to have a good time. He is by no means a bad person, he just doesn't like to be told what he can and can't do if he doesn't agree or approve of limitations he also can not work on someone else's time schedule. He use to be different, he use to be such a little goody good, he would follow all the rules and stuff like that he was such a wimp, I use to hate him when we were little and then other times I would love him but mostly I would hate him. Now I think he is one of my best friends-I think that this is because ever since I have been around him in the last year or so he has been really great and accommodating to me, he always makes me feel good and tries to make me feel welcome and special, my parents will say the exact opposite about him, they will say he is selfish and inconsiderate-they fight a lot-and in a lot of ways they are exactly right but in other ways they don't see things that I see. I am really grateful to my brother because in a lot of ways since I have been around him he has somehow taught me how to relax and have a good time. My parents will say that this is his specialty-relaxing and having a good time-they think he is really lazy and can't    be bothered to ever move, but actually I have noticed that when edward wants something he will do whatever is necessary to accomplish his task, since I've been in Austin it has been him who has called me several times to play tennis, and he also is surrounded by his friends and by women-this is not by chance. well my 20 minutes already passed",stream of consciousness,0,1,490,37.69,12.24,84.9,17.14,7.55,0.2,7.76,0,7.96,2.45,0.2,3.67,11.02,2.24,4.69,2.65,0.61,0.2,2.04,0.61,0.61,0,7.96,2.04,1.63,3.06,0.2,4.08,0.82,2.45,0.61,1.02,0.41,12.04,1.43,8.57,0.41,0.82,0.61,4.69,4.29,15.1,2.24,1.63,0.61,0,5.51,5.31,0.82,2.24,1.02,0.2,1.22,0.61,0.2,0.41,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.43,0,0.2,1.22,0,0,0,0,0.61,8.57,2.45,2.45,0,0,0,0,1.84,0,1.84,0,0,0

This girl is really cute and sweet, but I just got over a really hard break-up, and I am kind-of anxious about getting into a new relationship where the same thing could happen. I think that it is funny that, although I'm supposed to be writing in stream-of-consciousness, my spelling and grammar are almost impeccable. I wonder if the person who reads this will agree. I probab;y made a typo on some really easy word, and therefore the grader will assume that I am a pompous idiot that is too conceited to see my own faults. Or maybe that's me talking. Maybe I'm   grading   myself when I say something like that. Nine minutes and forty three seconds. It's funny that by the time I had written   nine minutes and forty three seconds,   that time had passed. I am now very ready to stop this assignment. Twenty minutes is not an absurd amount of time for the professor to ask for, but it does seem like a long time to write without stopping. I wonder what Tank is doing. I wonder if Laurie is going to come over to   see   him. I don't like Laurie very much. I think she's very annoying. She whines far too much. Now I'm whining about her. I hope I'm not keeping my roommate up with my typing. This keyboard is pretty loud. I still have to write for another seven minutes. My neck itches. There, that's better. My composition has gotten much less formal and much more personal since I mentioned the perfection of my spelling and grammar. Tank just walked in and totally interruptd my train of thought. He doesn't really respect people's space too much. But he's an overall pretty good guy.

Sometimes new is fun like in relationships. new is the best feeling in the whole world until it wears off it is sad and almost laughable how people can get tired of one another. Like my roommate and I are VERY  tired of each other right now. Every little thing she does annoys me and I am sure she feels the same way about some of my habits. I have several annoying ones. My boyfriend says he has not found any, but that leads back to the whole newness thing. He doesn't quite know me. and I'm not quite sure I want him to . I want some McDonald's right now because I am starving I haven't eaten since this morning because I have been running all over campus getting things done.

My sister loves to spend my parents money and I am finding out how easy it is when you're far from home and you don't see the negative effects your money spending is having on them they must really totally love us.

NaN,"Right now I just sat down to type this psychology paper. This is the first time I have ever typed a paper like this before, with constant writing. I am used to gathering my thoughts, thinking before I speak but now I am writing whatever pops into my mind. I am thinking about how much this different from something I would do in high school; being able to submit a paper via the internet that is amazing. I am hearing the faint sound of the Houston Astros baseball game in the background, I love baseball so much, this the pennant races are incredible. Hopefully I will  get to broadcast the game I love in the future. Well I have an hour until its time to go to work, its nice that the clock is ticking down on my first major writing assignment of college. Astros, I think still losing 3-2 someone just flied out. I'm enjoying the fact that I am able to do this from my own computer, god I would hate to live in a dorm. Sharing and small places are no fun for me. Looking forward to this weekend, big barbecue put on by my friend Mike; we always have legendary times at those. Its just starting to sink in now as I hear God Bless America in the background that today is September 11. It's hard to believe that our country was attacked only two years ago, it seems at least to me that it happened an eternity ago. I really don't agree with what is going on in our country right now, by the way. The wind is blowing pretty good outside right now, for some reason I have not opened the blinds in the house yet. I get really lazy when I am at home. Anyway, this a little easier than I thought it would be. It has really gotten me thinking. I mean how often do we really pay attention to what we are thinking, and are we thinking about something all the time? Consciously? Well I think we got our lead off man on in the 8th we are still down 3-2, I really hope we don't lose to Milwaukee. Man I don't want to go to work today, although 4-9:30 is not that bad, better than 12-9:30. I feel like I am writing in a journal more than doing a project, that is cool that there is actually a clock at the top of the page. Big props to the person who set that up. I was actually considering putting a stopwatch next to me for this assignment, but I quickly realized that was not necessary. I just found out I have discussion section class for geography. I don't get that if you understand the material why do you need a discussion section? I don't get what that is all about, is it for the TA's to feel important or something?

My stomach keeps growling, but I am not sure if I want to eat because I feel as though I shouldn't eat because I want to lose weight although all my friends say that I am crazy for feeling this way. They keep telling me that I am perfectly fine the way I am. I still don't believe them because they don't see what I see in the mirror everyday. I've been told that I have a contorted way of looking at myself and that when I look in the mirror I see something different from what everyone else sees. But isn't that true for a lot of people?  Don't a lot of people see themselves in the mirror and not like what they see?  I think that it is perfectly normal to feel this way. What isn't normal though is acting upon it. Oh well. I can still hear the television and sometimes it distracts my thoughts because I begin to pay more attention to what is on the tv rather than my own thoughts. Now I want goldfish because I just heard the commercial. I can't think of what to type again. I think that this assignment causes us to think too much about what to type and that it puts us on the spot so that we freeze up and are no longer able to type what we think because we keep trying to type interesting things and not simply what is really on our minds. My room mate just laughed. I wonder why she laughed. I can hear the people out in the hallway. These walls are really thin because I can always hear what is going on outside. The refrigerator noise is really annoying. It's so loud. I feel sick still. I just want to go lay in my bed and sleep forever. I never get enough sleep. I always end up staying up really late and then I feel dead in the morning. My foot is falling asleep as well as my hands. I have the worst circulation in the world. Why is it that my feet and hands are constantly falling asleep no matter what position I put them in. I think it has to do with the fact that I don't get the proper nutrients. My hands are starting to get tired now. I can't wait until I am finished typing. I have about 2 minutes left and actually it wasn't really that hard to type for 20 minutes consecutively. I wonder how long everyone else's writing assingments are. I bet some of them will be longer than mine because a lot of people can type faster than I can.

I could never go to that school. They have chapel every morning at 8. Wow, that's early. And they have community bathrooms. And, their dorms are small. I like my dorm at Dobie. It's nice and spacious, for a dorm anyhow. A whole lot better than Jester. I would hate to live in that cramped little space. Gross. And their bathrooms are gross because ditzy little girls are always getting too drunk and puking everywhere. Oh, the life a sorority hopeful.

NaN,"I'm so glad Lizz, my roommate, just left to see Brad, a guy she has liked for quite some time now. I think they should get together as more than friends, but sometimes that just doesn't work. I remember a time when a friend of mine turned out liking me as more. I don't know why this computer always makes some kind of noise like it's starting up even when IÔøΩm not using it. Someone is very loud in the hall. They sound like they are having fun. wish I could join them. Is Ben thinking about me right now?  I wonder were he is and if he loves me the way he says he does. I wish I was a better typist. There is so much chemistry I need to be doing. Is there a party in the next room?  Cohen just walked in. is he up to something?  This room is kind of hot and I could really drink something cold right now. I just hate people who expect me to understand them when they're speaking a language I don't know. French wouldn't be bad to learn, though. Wish I was at Disney World right now. I just saw Mickey and Minnie on my shelf and remember the great summer we had there. Well mom and dad were fun, but Brandon was a royal pain in the butt. I even have Chip and Dale wallpaper on my PC. gosh, am I a fanatic or what. I think I just know a good thing when I see one. Speaking of good things, I wish I was good at chemistry so I wouldn't have to study the rest of the night and early into the morning. I don't think I'm doing this assignment right because I'm now to the point where I'm thinking of things to say. sitting at this desk is not comfortable at all. My hair is in my face and I wish it was alot longer than it is so I could pull it back. Jester is not a bad place to live except for the constant interruptions. This comp is a pain because the mouse is built in and I always hit it when typing. Who keeps slamming those doors. Doesn't anyone have homework besides me. I put too much pressure on myself to make my parents proud of me. This coo-coo clock on my comp just made a noise and the bird, Iggy is so cute nose itches. it always does. Does that really mean that someone is thinking about me. If it's true I hope it's Ben. I wonder where he is now. Is he going to call me soon. When I get through with this I need to check my e-mail to see if anyone is trying to get a hold of me. I miss Tara. She's the only friend I can really tell things to.

NaN,"Don't get me wrong UT is great but there's still something missing: my girl, Maria. Sometimes life just don't make sense. One minute you're the king the next you're down in the gutter. Man I wish I was still with my girl, or shall I say ex. Things are messed up. All cause of family nagging and distance, the whole thing fell through. The hell with this ?oh college is awesome, so many chicks? crap. I had a girl who was good looking, not a ho, who was caring, who was intelligent, and loved me. Thanks to all these circumstances though outside my control, the break up took place, or rather the ?time off? as she put it. What's 230 miles got to do with it? Too bad she is a year younger or that I'm a year older. Things aren't fair in life. Speaking of bad things, my step father has been having problems with his kidneys recently. He started dialysis today back home in Eagle Pass. Funny how me and him used to be at each other's throat but over the last two to three years we bonded and got pretty close. I miss the bastard. It was weird seeing him cry the day that I left. Here was this macho tough guy crying over his step son leaving for college. My mom didn't fair much better either. She had the water works going. That was the toughest part of leaving town. I won't miss Eagle Pass much. Just some of the people I left behind, Maria included. Things change, I went down to watch a Eagle Pass football game last week. It was against our border rivals Del Rio. Trust me these two towns hate each other. They did a lot of talking but we still won the game by 11. Damn I say we like if I played or something. Anyways we beat them down last year by 11 in their place too. Good old? Del Rio, always an easy win. Austin is cool, but man there seems to me there's not many folks like me. All the white people seem to be afraid of me or something. Look in class sometime. I sit way in the back in seat 7 front row and there's always seats next to me open. If someone actually sits down its cause there's no where else to sit. I don't bite and I do shower. I guess people tend to hang with their kind. My kind doesn't exist here. The Hispanics here don't accept their heritage, most anyways. They either want to be white or black. I can't go up to them and say something like ?Que Onda? cause they DON'T know Spanish. Its messed up. My Spanish is decent but I look like a god compared to some of the Hispanics here. Oh well I'm glad that at least my roommate is my friend from my home town. At least we can still ?cag? it together.

Funny how your mind draws a blank when you are supposed to be writing what you are thinking at that very instant. A whole minute has gone by and I can not think of anything to type. I guess that's kind of the purpose. don't think ahead for once, just let everything come out just as quickly as it comes in. all day long, my mind has been jumbled up with. well, stuff, and now I can't seem to remember what all the """"""""stuff"""""""" was. Gosh, it's early and I'm already tired. It's not that today was stressful, just very hot and tiring. I can't wait until the weather finally cools off. I wish I could sleep in tomorrow. I wish I could go to sleep now. I hope what I actually write isn't important. After all, it's only a completion grade, right? I hope so. Sigh. Now that I'm thinking about it, this class kind of worries me, after 5 class days in here, I'm still not sure what to study or what to write down in my notes, the TA at the supplemental instructions class, I can't remember her name at the moment, says that we should pay attention to the book and the notes. But I think we wanted a more concise answer. My philosophy class is exactly the same. No body knows what to write in their notes, after all, all the notes we take are basically made up of questions. I'm a bit nervous about my first test in that class. And we are only going to have three, and that's counting the final. It has its good and bad points I guess. Double standard. Since I've started college, it seems like everything is a double standard. I don't live on campus that has its good and bad points. Umm, what else? Lots of things. hard to come with them right now. Dang, I still have to read for my writing class. ugh, that book is boring, I hope I don't fall asleep reading it again. More than likely I will seeing as how I'm sleepy right now.

Actually, I'm feeling a whole lot better now, as opposed to this morning. I wonder if I missed out on anything important in Linguistics. I doubt I missed out on much. Oh well. I'm relieved about the calculator issue regarding chemistry. I'm glad I know someone who has a car (means of transportation other than the bus). If I keep shopping I may soon find myself in need of help from my parents, financially. Then again, I am buying necessities: food, soap, water, DayQuill, NightQuill, etc. My nose is cleared up. That's something to be happy about. Ah. I can't help but smile at the fact that he came over and simply spent time with me today. He basically just watched me sleep, sniffle, and cough. He's so sweet. I kind of don't want to go home this weekend because of him. He's gone out of town the last two weekends, and now I'm going out of town. Hmm. I don't leave until Friday night. I guess I should try to get a hold of my parents. They may be interested in my visit. Shoot! Only twelve minutes have passed. I feel like I've been typing for a much longer time period. Uhoh, my nose is causing me to sniffle. Ugh. it's so annoying. Good thing I brought Kleenex with me. My mouth is dry. And my tongue hurts from chewing gum. I'm not use to chewing gum, at least not as much as I have been lately. I'm self conscious about my breath, since I have a sore throat. As a result I'm constantly chewing on cinnamon flavored gum. In a way, this isn't exactly my train of thought, at least not the uninterrupted form. I find myself with the need to explain, or give a bit of background info to the reader, if there even is indeed a reader. Ah well. Just three more minutes to go. I can't wait to get back up to my cold room, pop open a can of ginger ale and chug. I've successfully made mouth feel even more dry. My throat is starting to hurt again, but only when I swallow.

NaN,"All this entire thing is going to be about is about my failing relationship with Ben. I think so many different things that I don't know what to think. I can't help but being hurt by him seeing another girl even though we both agreed that we were going to see other people. I just don't see how he could still love me but be with someone else, I just can't because I don't even have a desire to find another   boyfriend   or whatever. I'm hurt so badly right now, all I want in the world is for him to tell me how much he loves me and always will, but I don't want him to say it only because he knows that's what I want to hear. I have to talk to him about this but I'm so scared. I'm so scared that he'll tell me that he just doesn't love me anymore and that is going to kill me. I don't know what to think!! I mean, if he ever really loved me the way he said he did, I don't see how he could already be dating or talking to someone else. I don't know. I wouldn't mind him dating other girls, it's just that it's been a while since he's let me know how he feels about me, if I know and truly know that he loves me and I get just the occasional reminder of his love, then I truly don't think that I'll have a problem with him seeing other girls because I know that eventually I will be seeing other guys too. But even if I was seeing other guys right this instant, then I would still feel the same way about him. I would still love him as much as I ever did because when you truly care about someone, those feelings don't just go away because the person goes away and if they do, then you never really loved the person anyway. I just love him so much and I am sooo scared that when I talk to him tonight, I'm going to find out what I'm scared to death to find out. And even if he does still care about me, things are just so COMPLICATED!  I mean, take when I come down for Homecoming, yesterday he said he still wanted to see me but he didn't really seem very excited about it as I would hope, maybe he is but he just doesn't like to show it, I don't know. But he's talking to this girl and right now it might not be a big deal, and a month and a half from now, everything with her could have gone to crap or a month and a half from now it could have made its way into being something more and if it is something more by then, is he still going to want to see me if he has her??

NaN,"Today has been a very stress ful day starting with the first time I ever missed a class. Today my parents and I got in a fight and I was going to be late to class so  I decided to just not go. This caused my parents to be evenmore upset with me. Not to mention that we were already stressed about the apartment situation for next year. Isn't that retared to hav eto sign a lease in September for the following school year? You don't even know if you will get along with the people that you ahve agreed to live with for the entire year. A realty company makes everything so much more difficult. We have to pay a application fee and a security depsoit of $35 adn $480 respectivly. In the upcoming week we have to put our firsty monts rent down which is $481. It is just rediculous that we have to worry about this at this point in time. I am also extremly stressed about school. First of all I don't know what to expect coming from hogh school to college. Second of all, all the professors throw all this stuff at you st once and expect you to remeber itall. It is completly over whelming to a freshman. Third on my list, my soroity is also giving us all these dates to remember, things to sign up for, dues to pay, committments to fulfill that everything is all mumble jumble in my head. I am completely overwhelmded. Foutrh of all, I never get any sleep. I had to go home to Houston to get rest and to be able to study. Fifth -- I have not been able to fit my routine work out into my schedule yet. I am terrified about gaining the freshman fifteen. This summer I wroked so hard to lose weight, and I finally did. I will be greatly depressed if I gain it back and more!!!!  College is supposed to be the best four years of your life, but so far it has been one big stress pile up. I can;t take it. Not to mention that I am completwly homesick. I am so close to my family it is ridiculous. I miss my mom to no extent. My sister just got engaged and I feel like I am missing out on all of the party plans. I feel so far away. My dad has to be the most unselfish wise person I know. He adds so much to a converation. I miass them all so much. Everyhting brings me to tears these days if I start to think too long about it. One of the most important things in my life I forgot. My dog Jake. I miss his sweet face so much. He was such a good friend and companion. I never have any time to email my friends in London or in other colleges around the nation.

NaN,"faster if they stare at the clock. Personally, I think the clock goes by so much quicker if I'm not constantly staring at it all the time. I wonder how many spelling mistakes I've failed to correct in this writing assignment, oh well. Back to the business training, I hope the ninety dollars were well spent. I really hope that BWW has put together somethin good this year, something that all the BWW/QUIXTAR-Affiliated Independent Business Owner can benefit from. Man that was a pain to type, I probably should've just typed BWW/QUIXTAR IBO's for that matter. Anyways, most of my friends don't seem to believe in the business that I'm participating in, well actually, owning. I don't really get any respect from them at all, and sometimes I really wonder why that is. The only thing I'm waiting to do now is being able to handle my business correctly, expand it large enough so I'll have multi-million dollar returns. And then I think I'm going to come back and laugh at all of the people that has disparaged the activity I was involved in. Even better, the stupid electrical engineers that I call friends can work for me in the future. Just as Robert Kiyosaki says,   an intelligent person hires people who are more intelligent than they are to work for them.  I will be able to prove myself one day. Being able to beat them down is probably the only drive or motivation that exists in my life. Besides Daisy of course, she is the love of my life. Without her, I don't think I would've sanely passed through the toughest times of my life. I'm really hoping to get married to her one day, and make her the happiest woman on the face of this planet by providing her with everything that I possibly can. Looks like I better get rich quick. But, I doubt she's interested in me being rich, I truly believe that she's with me today because it was her choice. She's not the type of person that would regret any decisions she has made in the field of love and relationships, which is something I really respect. She always gives her all, always tries to put on a smile just for me even though she may be having the worst day of her life. I'm so lucky that I've found her, and I'm willing to treasure this relationship for the rest of my life. I cannot really express my love for her in words, nor in sentences, maybe not even an essay of this length. All I can pray for is that someday, she will be able to touch my heart with her hands and fully understands the kind of appreciation that resides within the innermost side of my heart. I thank God everyday for all the things He has bestowed upon me. Of course, besides eternal life, Daisy is the next greatest gift that I have ever received.

NaN,"group of friends that turned on me and I don't think I ever forgave them. I went my own way in high school but to this day I still think of their betrayel and I can still feel the pain from it. Even though I haven't always had the best friends in the world, if I have a falling out with a friend I usually will make up with them later on in life. We might not be friends again but the air will be cleared and we can be civil to each other. That also works for my ex-boyfriends, it seems like after about a year we will begin to talk again and everything is ok. I've always been able to make friends with guys better than I have with girls, I really do not think I'm that much of a tomboy but I just think they are easier to get along with and cause less drama. My first year in college was the first time I think I made more girl friends but that also might be because I'm in nursing and there is a serious shortage of men in that field. I don't mind girls I just think they have more issues than guys. I also think it's really weird that I haven't found that one single person yet either. Everyone says that in college is when you find your husband and - or wife, but I think I'll just let it happen when it happens. Like even if I like one guy, there is almost always another one. I think I like like four guys right now and its terrible. One has a girlfriend, but is going to dump her in a little bit, apparently she is being a bitch. He doesn't know I like him but his friends do, it's crazy. I think I've been boy crazy all my life, seriously. If a hot guy walks by I just turn to mush. I think the ideal guy would be about my height, not too tall or short, with dark hair and either green or blue eyes. He would have to be tan of course and have the best sense of humor either. He would also have to be a talker, I'm really into having good conversations. Don't get me wrong there is always time for silence or just having fun but every relationship I've been in has failed because of some communication issue and I think I've just learned that as long as you keep the communication channels open things will be good. I think I am a good communicator fo. r the most part, I know I'm a good peace maker and keeper, coming from a family where I had two sisters and one brother I guess its no surprize. I've noticed that people like to tell me about their problems also. I can just be sitting somewhere and someone will start talking to me and telling me their life story and I think it's just because they want someone to listen and that's exactly",stream of consciousness,0,1,510,21.25,9.61,84.9,17.06,10.39,0.59,10.98,0.59,2.94,1.96,0.2,4.31,10.59,1.76,4.51,2.35,0,0.39,2.16,0,0.39,0.2,8.04,0.98,3.92,2.94,0,4.12,1.18,1.96,0.2,1.18,0.59,12.16,1.96,4.9,1.57,0.98,2.55,3.53,1.96,14.31,3.33,2.55,0.78,0,8.04,5.69,0.59,1.96,0.59,0.2,1.37,0.59,0.2,0,0.2,0.2,0,0,0,0,0.59,0.59,0,0,0,0.2,0.2,0,1.37,11.57,4.51,2.75,0,0,0,0,0.39,0,3.92,0,0,0

NaN,"that we all have something in common and we need to stick together.            The news is starting to get on my nerves finally. What is really weird is me, probably like many other people, were wondering what today would be like. Would everyone stay inside and remain in their own personal prison?  I even thought maybe they would cancel classes and more. What happens?  Everyone just continues on with their life and just keeps 9/11 in their thoughts, but refuses to let it take them down. It seems we are too strong of a country to fall apart over something like that. For a while after 9/11 i was pretty scared. I wondered what was going to happen. I almost didn't even want to be in the country. But then, when thinking about what i'd be giving up, I realized that even if the US is under attack, it's still the best country in the world.            Now they are doing the   I am an American   commercial. They are analyzing how the different people say it. Makes me wonder how i would say it if I were to be on TV. Would i say it proudly, or with anger in voice (toward the terrorists), sadly, or just normal. The different tones were amazing. I never looked that much in the to the commercial until now. Wow. I bet now most people would say it proudly, but what about a week after the attacks?  Would you not say it with pride, yet more sorrow. There is just a huge amount of commercials on TV that deal with this situation.            Although commercials are effective, I feel the commercials that are the most important would be the ones containing music. Music is so powerful. You know, when you're hearing that God Bless the USA or America the Beautiful or whatever you just have that proud feeling and it lifts your spirits. Similar to church I suppose. Whenever I'm at church I get that lift from the songs and just feel so moved. That's exactly how I feel when I hear those patriotic songs.              Well, I suppose in many ways, God was able to turn such a terrible thing into such a powerful thing. The Sunday after 9/11 was the most populated church day ever at all the churches. I know I was at church. Everyone just needed to hear something good. I don't really worry about that stuff anymore. I figure it's like worrying i'm going to get the Red Nile Virus or whatever. I mean, they act like it's the terrible virus but it hasn't even killed 20 people. Heat kills more people than that. Let's go worry about heat now.

NaN,"I'm feeling that I miss my girlfriend in San Antonio. As we do this i feel that she is my everthing i can't get her out of my head. what else I can't get out of my head is this music that the dorm next door to me is playing, it is making me really frustrated because i can't think quite as well. I hope that Jess is okay, i worry about her a lot. She doesn't sleep too well, and that kind of worries me but she is extremely strong so i'm not too worried about it. I am kind of worried about what she just wrote to me in a letter i got. I know that she loves me but this college stuff, being apart and all is quite difficult. I don't like it and neither does she, and she wrote something that worries me, that she kind of wishes that we never met so that we never fell in love and therefore never have to endure the hardship of parting. I miss her a lot. My days primarily consist of me waiting around for her to get to her computer so I can instant message her, and communicate with her, truly the highlight of my day. The rest of my day is that of school, college that is, and I feel somewhat like a hermit but not too much, because I have her. She really is my everything, and I know that we will be together, forever. One thing that I do feel uneasy about is the fact that she is a christian and that I am an Atheist. This hasn't played a part in our relationship, but I'm afraid that one day it will. I am a pacifist Atheist and therefore will usually ignore most people's idea's, I know that that is wrong but oh well it's the way that I feel. I really don't want to destroy her sense of spirituality either, I've done it before to other people and it really makes them feel bad, and lost. I don't ever want to hurt Jess, I love her, in fact I feel that I have to protect her from everything. I miss her, I don't like the fact that I have to be here in Austin and she is nearly by herself in San Antonio. But there is a glimer of hope, we might get an apartment together next year. I really hope that we do, that would be so great. I can think of nothing better than waking up to her smiling face everyday, and thinking to myself that I am the luckiest guy in the world. I hope that that happens, it really does help to have something that you can think about while you are away from someone that you love. All I can think about is how great it is when I make my bi-monthly trips during the weekends to see her.

I  thought I would be much more home sick, but I don't know what I am missing, or if I  am missing anything at all. I know I miss work, nothing made me more happy  really. I know it wasn't fun all the time, but the people there made it worthwhile. One in particular, no two in particular both for different reasons. I wonder when life is going to get easy. I have been working hard since I was 16,  balancing a job, school, and trying to have a life. Trying is the key word. Sometimes I think I missed out in high school. I was never the party type, only  because my parents wouldn't let me do anything, but I understand that they just  want the  best for me and don't want me to make the same mistakes that they  made. What they don't understand is that, it is holding me back, because  eventually I may be in the same situation that they were in, and I won't know what  to do. If I were to live anywhere in the world I would live in England, Surrey was  nice. London is amazing. I don't know what to say other than when I was there I  felt home, I loved it. I surprisingly enjoyed having the ability to commute rather  than drive. I enjoy taking drives though. When I was at home, I enjoyed just  grabbing my keys and going. I never had a particular destination, but my favorite  drives were at night, with the sun roof open, oh how it was so peaceful. Kind of  like sailing. Recently I joined the saililng club, it is nice, I wish there was more  wind my first sail, but even so it was still unbelievably calm, and placid. It was so  nice, and made time go by so fast. I feel so stupid about Endochine, I can't believe  we were just talking to them and didn't know it was then, awwww. I feel so  stupid. But then again there are a lot of times I feel stupid. too many to list. I can  not wait to go to the football game. I miss band the most from high school, there  was nothing like marching into the stadium, especially this past year when the  crowd was actually happy that we were there. I honestly never thought I would  see the day that that would happen. Christina Aguilera's CD is very good, at least  most of it. it is kind of sad at the same time.

NaN,"good friends with my boyfriend. She and I are cordial to each other in person. We hate each other really though. I know she hates me a lot-my boyfriend told me. I hate that she hates me because I am usually nice to her. But , I hate her too. But she is obnoxious to me and kind of bitchy. So, I think I have the right to not like her. Wow, twenty minutes is a long long time. I still have 8 minutes left and I feel like I need to do something else. Maybe that means I have ADD. I cannot read for more than like 20 minutes at a time. Its really hard to be like that in college cause everything is reading. I am behind in all of my classes. I study and read-I just have to take breaks and re-read a lot cause I don't catch everything. Like I try to keep up, but I can't. Its bad. I need to study more but then I stress myself out if I don't do anything but study. I need to be in organizations because they help take my mind off of school for a short time period. I stress myself when I study 24/7. That is how it was over the summer. Everyone else went to Frat parties every night and I stayed in and studied. There were NO organizations to be in. There were only frat parties. And I don't even like frat parties all the time. Drunk people can be fun sometimes--but like a million guys and just a couple girls can be obnoxious. 8 drunk guys hitting on you all once is a little overwhelming. And plus boyfriends do not generally like that. So, I stayed in and studied. I was so focused on my grades that I would stress out about getting anything worse than an 85. Because I was not completely done with a rough draft of paper once, I stressed out so much that I threw up. it was really bad. All of my friends were REALLY worried about me. I passed out and everything. Over a paper! yeah, that is pretty scary. I guess I am just not good with my time management. I don't know. Something is really messed up with me I think. My boyfriend thinks I could use a counselor. But if I see a counselor I probably will not have time for activities besides school. And that would not give me anytime to not think about school-which is what activities do for me. I like that I am doing them. I hope I make Lassos. I am worried that that will take too much time and stress me out even more. We shall see.

That's all of the Creed to the FFA I can rememeber, although I had to recite it for many times. I feel somewhat out of place in my apartment with 4 other room mates because I pay the least rent but I have the most disposable income. I'm not sure if I spell a lot of words incorrectly because I'm dyslexic. I will say that by typing, my spelling improves. My hand writing is horrible. I can bearly read the things I write. I've worked out deals with most all of my teachers in the past about letting me take assignments home and write them. Man, this room is hot. I just turned on the fan but it's still way too hot. I want to take guitar and speed reading classes. Those are two areas of my life in which I think I drastically need improvement. Although, none of which are pertinent to my life right now. I supose the speed reading class might be. I'm so far behind in my readings for all my classes, I don't want to start. Twenty minutes is a long time to write about nothing. I wonder how many books have started, or been intirely written with not forthought what so ever going into the plot. I had a dream I thought should be a book the other night, but I can't remember it. My memmory has been getting worse daily. Not just because of the alcohol consumption. I think I'm acutally drinking less now than I did in high school.

The part that bothers me is that I don't have the same free time as she does, so all my free time still goes to her, but she's dating other people. I told her today that I wanted to sever ties for 3 weeks and see how that goes. She's totally against it, and if I were her, I would be too. She still has the comanionship of her 1st and longest boyfriend, and can date other people on the side. One of which is the same age as my 23 year old brother who is a huge reason we broke up in the first place.

I guess it comes from being an alternate, because half the time we practiced pregame (which hasn't been much) I was forced to sit on the sidelines and watch. oh boy, don't I love watching. I really hate just sitting there as an alternate, because I feel like I'm a cheap addition to the band. like I wasn't quite good enough to deserve a marching spot. but on the flip side, they must think that I'm good enough because I'm expected to jump in on game day and march pregame if someone is sick, late, drunk, or too hungover to march. I feel bad for thinking this but I kind of want Kelvin's knee to keep him from marching on Saturday. maybe he'll have me march pregame for him, since taps stride is a lot more painful. I don't want to wish that pain on him, though, because he's a sweet guy and deserves to march every game. plus he's a 5th year and he doesn't have many more games left. thank god this room has finally warmed up. or maybe its because I put some pants on. do I smell smoke?? that wouldn't be good.

I don't think my roommate likes Henry very much but I don't know that for sure. he always calls when my roommate isn't here which to me is a signal that they're not really in sync. when I feel most confident about my relationships with others is generally when we're in sync with each other.

I hate to type, because I am not very good at it and on top of that I do not use very good grammar or punctuation, even after I checked and rechecked my work. So it does worry me that I will have to turn this assignment in unrevised. I cannot get itout of my head how weird I think this assignment is MY friend is now leaning over my shoulder trying to read the assignment and she is making me very nervous. i can not stand to be nervous. The girl next to me just call the little whistle on her screen which notifies her of new mail, and I was thinking that I love it when I hear that noise. Earlier before I started this assignment I checked my e-mail and I had one new message from my friend Travis who goes to Sam Houston State, I was so excited to hear from him he is one of my really good friends. the lady that is in charge of the computer station just made this girl show her, her id and when she asked for it she was not very nice. Which makes me think of the fact that I very strongly dislike people who are rude when they are providing a serviece to you. I mean it is like they are getting paid to do this so I do not know why a little common courtesy is so hard to come by, I am getting really bored with this assignment because I am having a hard time concentrating on typing while at the same time letting things naturally flow into my thoughts. But I guess that you are used to that, I am like also wondering why I am acting like you are actually going to read this because I know that you are not and it seems stupid to sit here and just jabber about nothing, someone else just got the e-mail alarm and once again I am reminded of my most recent message, which I was very excited about, my friend next to me is the",stream of consciousness,0,1,513,32.06,13.06,83.43,17.15,11.5,0,11.5,0.78,2.34,2.53,0,2.92,10.72,2.14,4.87,2.14,0.19,0.39,2.73,1.36,0.97,0,6.24,1.36,2.53,1.36,0,2.53,1.95,1.75,0.78,0.97,0,7.6,1.75,3.9,0.78,0,0.78,4.48,2.53,14.81,0.97,1.36,0.97,0,7.02,4.09,1.56,1.17,0.19,0.58,0.39,0.58,0.19,0.19,0.19,0,0.19,0,0,0,0.97,0.78,0.19,0,0,0,0.19,0,0.58,6.63,2.92,2.73,0.39,0,0,0,0.39,0,0.19,0,0,0

NaN,"a half to get there, and then we drove back and partied here. It was a blast!  Although my girlfriend got a little carried away drinking and ended up throwing up for some of the night. But it was ok because she was really fun before we went to bed. We also tried going to a club called BOYZ CELLAR, but my friend (Robyn), the one who picked me up, is 17. So they didn't let her in because you have to be 18, so of course, none of us went in. That pretty much sucked because I was really looking forward to that. I guess we'll just wait for another good weekend and we'll all go because her birthday just so happens to be about two weeks from now. And now about school. Let me tell you, the classes here at UT are not going to be anything easy, thats for sure. I am taking 6 classes (15 hours). I am trying to major in Biology, but. my strong point is absolutely not Biology. And thats because this semester I am taking Biology 211, Biology 212, Chemistry 301, Calculus 408K, Cardiovascular and weight training, and of course, Psychology with you. So, I'm looking forward to a pretty tough semester. I just know that I have to study a lot and listen in class and take good notes and hopefully everything will go my way. I don't really want to start off bad because it is not a good impression on the professors or anybody who is looking for someone to fill a job opening. My goals for the future would have to be that I want to live with my girlfriend, somewhere VERY NICE. And I want to be someone that makes pretty good money. And I want to have a couple of pets. Not too many. And I know that my girlfriend wants A LOT. she probably has been planning some part of her future in her mind. Like, at least what kind of house she wants, or something of that sort. I mean, she already has the exact ring that she wants when she gets married. She wants it to be white gold, with a big   ROCK   on it. Sounds pretty simple, doesn't it?!  :)  So yeah. and. well, I think my parents are going to come up and visit soon. I really didn't want them to come up here, I'd rather go down there. because I think that maybe I would feel awkward having my entire family in my dorm for a while. And then hanging out with them here on the weekend. I think I would be too tempted to just be like, ok. well, I'll see you tomorrow afternoon, and go out to a club or something. But, well. that's all for now. I can't really think of anything else to type. My mind has totally gone blank. I have typed everything that I am thinking and maybe even EVERYTHING that I have thought about the entire day.",stream of consciousness,0,1,503,12.57,13.32,85.69,15.71,7.75,1.19,8.95,0.8,2.78,1.99,0.6,4.17,13.32,2.19,3.18,2.78,0,0.8,0.4,0,0.2,0,9.54,1.39,1.79,3.38,0.2,5.77,1.39,1.99,0.8,0.8,0.2,8.35,0.6,5.96,0.8,0.4,0,4.37,3.58,11.73,2.58,3.78,1.59,0.4,7.36,5.17,3.18,3.78,2.98,0.2,0.6,1.19,0.99,0,0,0.2,0.2,0,0,0,0.4,0,0,0.4,0.2,0,0.2,0,0.4,17.1,7.55,5.57,0.2,0,0.2,0.4,0,0,2.19,0.99,0,0

My roommate just came in. She thinks I am mad at her and I am a little. I'm always waiting on her and it's annoying. I hadn't eaten anything all day and I was about to go to the cafeteria and she wanted me to wait for her . Thirty minutes later we start walking to the cafeteria and she decides she's not hungry. I had waited for nothing. We get along very well, but I don't think she realizes what she does. She keeps interrupting me while I'm writing this and it's timed. She got mad at me just now because I asked her to be quiet. She left the door open and there's someone playing their music pretty loudly. I really don't like the girls next door. We get along with the girls who live a couple of doors down very well. The one's next door just aren't very friendly. My roommate heard one of the girls slamming stuff around and griping because I was playing Ozzy Osborne. One of them is in choir and she's always doing voice exercises. I hope my roommate doesn't start acting like I'm mad at her or vice-versa. She's on the phone. Her guy problems are pretty entertaining. I try to help her out, but I really can't empathize with her. She has a completely different approach and understanding with the opposite sex. Zack is going back to Graham tonight. He's one of my friends from home. I've known him since kindergarten. I've also been infatuated with him since kindergarten. Maybe he'll decide he likes me too. I doubt it though. That's a depressing thought. Oh well. There are plenty of other guys around here. In Graham there were not even close to as many. Population:9,000. Graduating class: 134. That's why I came here. I wanted to be in a place with many other people. I have definitely found that place. A lot of people from Graham thought I was crazy for wanting to come here. I guess different people want different things. it makes sense. One of our friends from down the hall just came in. She's very cool. She's going to let me use her computer to type this, which is sweet of her. It's very beneficial to know people. Everyone has something to offer. Of course, you have to give also. Some are better at that than others. I know IÔøΩve given plenty of cigarettes. Hopefully I've contributed more than just that. I've offered advice, which of course I always thought was good advice.

The doomsday clock is set to 40 years from now, that is the point of no return, if things stay the way that they are now, there will be no hope for the future. If we had all just stayed with animism, and believed that the earth is not something for us to own, or control, if we would acknowledge that we are the weakest animal alive in that we are totally and utterly dependent on other animals giving their lives so that we may survive, how could we take away their right to the same land we live on. But there are no classes teaching what people really want to know, what they need to know, only classes perpetuating our way of life. Only classes brainwashing the brainwashed so suddenly that we don't even notice. So why study me when there are billions of other mindless zombies in this world. Now I realize that my writing may sound bleak, as if I'm in a state of utter depression, that I'm innately sad, but it's my very strong belief that with the world the way it is everyone should, and deserves to feel the depression that haunts us all. We keep on trying to come up with ways to hide from ourselves the atrocities being carried out everyday by white collared crooks, making executioner executive decisions. But humans shouldn't need pills to control their feelings, they shouldn't need pills to make them happy, they shouldn't need pills to force their inner feelings into submission. It pains me very deeply to see the day to day transfer we are making into a controlled society, and the people that don't see it, if it isn't already here. Our phones are tapped, our emails are spied on, the government we live under even monitors what books we are checking our in order to make sure were not reading anything that could be dangerous. People wake up everyday and take zoloft, prosac, ritalin, adderol, valium, zanex, anything that will keep them from deviating from what is considered acceptable behavior, to keep them inline. Anything to keep them from focusing on how ridiculous it all is, anything to keep them so fucked up they just don't care anymore. Anything to hide the",stream of consciousness,0,1,511,26.89,18,76.52,12.92,1.57,4.89,6.46,0.39,2.94,3.72,0.2,4.5,13.89,1.76,4.31,2.35,0.59,1.17,1.96,0,0.78,0.78,10.57,0.78,2.74,5.09,0.59,4.31,1.96,1.76,0.59,0.39,0.78,11.15,0.98,8.41,0,0,1.76,3.33,1.96,11.74,1.37,3.13,1.76,0.2,4.5,6.46,0.59,2.15,1.37,0.2,0.78,1.17,1.17,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.78,0.39,0.2,0,0.2,0,0.2,0,0.2,13.7,3.52,7.44,0,0,0,0,0.2,0,2.54,0,0,0

NaN,"Jeez, why has it taken my so long to do this assignment?  Why do I always put everything off to the last minute???  Procrastination seems to have effected my whole life. Even when I was a little kid in elementary school I can rememeber putting off projects till the last night. My mom would always get mad and say you should wait till the last minute to do things, but for some reason that just never got through to me. I don't want to procrastinate. but it do. I always tell myself that I'm going to start it early, but it always ends up the same way. Is this the way it's going to be my whole life?  Man, I hope not, but who am I kidding. This is the way my brain functions. Procrastination is apart of me. I love the saying, hard work pays over time, but laziness pays off now. That's like my motto. Even though I wish it wasn't. I wish I could be like those kids who when they got a project assigned in school, to run home and start it right away. I wish my brain would say, lets get all of this hard work out of the way so we can have fun and relax later. But of course the reality is my brain is saying, well since the project isn't do for another week that means I don't have to start it for another week, I can just sit back and relax until then. AAGGGHHHH!  I always tell myself I'm going to change my ways, but it never freaking happens. Well I know I'm not the only one with this problem. I know most other college kids puts things off to the last minute too. But dammit, when I think about it really pisses me off. I should have written this essay last week, but no. Here I am, Sunday night, writing an essay that is due tomorrow. it's just like clockwork. I always put off studying too. I really need to study for tests in advance, but I always wait till the night before to do practically all of my studying. A lot of times I wake up early that moring and study before the test. Damn you procrastination, damn you to hell!  It's going to be the death of me. I can just imagination how much better of a gpa I would have if I would just study more. Things have got to change, or I'm really going to screw up bad. Dammit. All of this writing about procrastination had gotten my thinking about my mom. I know she worries about me. She knows I always procrastinates. I wish she didn't have to worry about me doing ok in school. She didn't have to worry about my older brother. He was an A student.

It should a kind of therapy  I think that they have already made that up  musical therapy. One of my friends from high school that is going to University of North Texas is majoring in that I think.

It's not terribly late so I thought it would be nice to write something on my thoughts right before I go to bed. Today was a good day. Not too much stress and I talked to a lot of my friends and family. Its always nice when I get to talk to old friends from hs. today I met a girl that went to the same elementary as me. we didn't know each other, but we had a connection because we were from the same town. MOst people have never heard of my town before, so it was pretty cool. I also met a girl this morning that went to the other hs in my town, which again is strange. I actually met a lot of people, one of the girls has a class with me and we live right down the hall from each other. I'm glad to know that I have someone that I can study with or ask a question if I need help anytime I want. One good thing about college is that it's really easy to make friends. Even if you're a shy person, there's always someone who is willing to talk to you. I used to be really shy, but I don't have much of a problem introducing myself to random people, I actually enjoy doing that now. I look foward to those that I will meet tomorrow, I just hope I can remember everyone's name when I see them again. I've met so many people in such a short period of time that it becomes difficult to match names with faces. I enjoy all of my classes, I'm feeling pretty comfortable in my decision on what I plan to major in. It seems that I really do enjoy chemistry and biology, but I'm really glad to have a psychology class to take my mind off of things that I have to do. I'm really excited about Wednesday. I'm going to try out for the rowing team. I think I'm really going to enjoy the workouts and meeting new people. I hope I make the team, but I don't want to get my hopes up, so I'm just going to see how it goes. Today I went to the gym to see how difficult rowing really is and I feel much more comfortable with my decision. I was able to row correctly, although it gets kind of confusing at times because it is not a natural movement. but I was able to row for 2000 meters non-stop my first try, and I think that's pretty good because I only have to row for 500 meters for the tryouts. I'm not sure how good my chances are at making the team. I haven't been on a sports team since middle school. but I have been in band since sixth grade. band may not be the best workout ever or the most strenuous, but marching can get pretty tiring, and I",stream of consciousness,0,1,511,17.62,11.15,83.76,16.24,12.13,0.78,12.92,0.39,0.2,1.96,0,5.28,14.29,1.17,5.68,4.11,1.17,0.98,1.57,0.78,0,0,10.18,1.57,2.15,3.52,0,4.5,0.98,2.15,0.78,0.98,0.39,8.41,2.35,1.96,0.59,0.2,1.76,4.89,3.91,15.46,1.17,1.96,0.78,0.39,3.91,4.89,1.76,3.91,2.94,0.2,0.78,2.54,0.78,1.37,0,0.39,0,0,0,0,0.39,0.2,0,0.2,0.39,0,0,0,0,12.92,5.48,3.33,0,0,0,0,0.2,0,3.91,0,0,0

I'm so happy they played my favorite song, too. I was surprised how many Victoria people were there too. I think Nick is so cute too! I haven't seen Lynette in a while that was surprising. I wonder if she still thinks I'm a bitch for all that crap in high school. I'm starting to realize that Austin isn't as fun as I thought it'd be. It's a crazy place to live, but after being in College Station all I think about is how fun it'd be to live there. There's so many teenagers and so much to do at night. The cat's distracting me it keeps trying to drink my water. I think I hurt it when he flew off the table. I'm going to make pizza to eat pretty soon here. I can't remember the last time I ate at the same time Karla did. Hopefully my car will be ready soon because this no ac is really pissing me off. Which doesn't really matter anyways since there's no place to park without having to pay five dollars. I don't like going to Eco class very much. I feel like the teacher is going to jump up and ask some question and I have no idea what he's talking about. I haven't even been reading as much as I thought I would in school. Maybe I should start too because it'll probably start to get hard and then I really won't know what anyone's talking about. I always wonder if Austin is getting tired of me. I know he always thinks about getting with another girl, but I'd really like to see what he does and how he is when he's all drunk at some party. That's going to be weird when he joins that frat but him and Roe fit in with them pretty good I think.

I think it's pretty cool how we can just type all of this on the computer and not even have to turn in a paper. I was kind of surprised. I wonder if everything will be like that in the future; if all work will end up being done over the Internet and just mailed to teachers. It's definitely less of a hassle. I'm excited about this weekend. I'll get to see a lot of my family and some friends back in Houston. I really want to see Corey. He's such a great guy, and I think I  really hold back from getting too close to him. I guess it's because I knew I'd be moving, and I don't want to be attached to someone that I can't always see. It'll be nice to see him though. I might get to see one of my best friends too. She goes to SFA, but she'll be home this weekend too. I think she's having tons of fun at college too.

My Norton firewall just detected another blocked intrusion. I don't like this. Annoying hackers. Why don't they just go one with their lives without bothering decent people like me. I have 4 roommates and they are all good except for one. He is nice and all but he does have annoying habits and it seems he does not know proper manners. He watches TV loudly even though he knows people are trying to sleep. He even woke me up listening to music using my own computer without asking my permission to use it. That is so annoying and I can't stand it right now. My goodness, it has only been 3 mins? I've been writing a lot of things already. My arms are hurting because I can't type for so long and I hate typing. I'm not a typer, my brother and cousin are flawless typers but I am not. I already had so many errors in typing right now it is so annoying me. I want to destroy this key board. I want to use the voice typing method but even that is a pathetic technology which is still in its infancy. This is really annoying me. I want to take the psych research right now but I can't because I am not 18 yet. That is a load of bullshit if u ask me. can't it be 17? What is your advantage to your peers in the same batch or class who are older than you by a few months?? A few months of extra knowledge??? I don't think so. I hate my birthday, there is also a math midterm on my birthday, hooray for me. how nice, what a nice birthday gift. I have a tendency to measure how much I type. I always limit myself and not going to much bec. I always fear my efforts are being wasted or something and I am very lazy so I will rather do nothing or stop doing something if there is no punishment involved. Like this writing assignment right now, if this was not graded or the lose of not doing this is very minimal, I will just stop and just receive the consequences rather than waste 20 minutes of my time doing nothing but write, senseless writing. And I ate writing, I hate the damn typo errors, I hate now typing fluidly like others, I hate making mistakes, I hate typing because it hurts my hands and fingers! I hate this activity. I am not in a very good mood right now, I kind of understand that, I wonder why? Is it my roommate? maybe, is it this senseless activity? maybe. maybe its because University of Texas has cut my freaking internet, no I can't download beyond 8 gigs. nooo bec. u are taking up too much bandwidth and leaving none for the others.

I had always wanted to go to A&M, because I am definitely the more conservative type, but I have amazed myself in that I absolutely love it here. Austin is such a neat town, and there is always something to do. In Dallas, we had to sit and figure out something to do on a Friday night. Most of the time, we never came up with anything. Here in Austin, there is not one night where nothing is going on. There's a ton of good restaurants and fun places to go to. Especially Barton Springs, it was a great place to go for a picnic on a Sunday afternoon. I have family down here in Austin, so it is neat to have a place to go. I feel much more secure. They are about 20 minutes away, which is perfect, because they are not too close, but they are close enough for me to drive over to whenever I get sick of the campus. My cousin, who just got back from a mission trip in the Phillippines, will be living at my aunt and uncles house next year while she is working at a church. It will be neat to finally be living in the same city as her. I have always seen her on trips and family stuff, but never have I actually been in the same place with here for more than a week. So I am really looking forward to the friendship and bond that we will be making this next year. I am hoping that my year goes good and that I can keep up with all of my classes. I am planning on going to all of them, and trying not to miss them. I also really want to keep up with the reading and stuff, so I wont be as stressed out at exam time.

I have just gotten back from a meeting about the Texas Lonestars organization and LOVED it!  The only problem is that I am just a freshman still getting use to the whole college life and time management thing. I am kind of stressed out (but not nearly as bad as I know I can get sometimes) just because I am pre med and I know that I really need to concentrate on my grades and school work while also getting involved. Getting involved, however has never been a problem for me. I love to be involved in everything. Now that is a problem because if I spread myself too thin I am not going to be able to put forth my best in each venue. I know for sure that I want to do something involving dance because it has been such an intricate part of my life for so long and is truly one of my passions. I am going to try out for the Roustabouts and the Steel Dance Company. I am beginning to get nervous just because I haven't really gotten the chance to practice anywhere here since I've been away from home. I hope that I am able to keep my grades really good while also having fun and enjoying my college experience. I know that I am here to get an education, but it's obvious to everyone that college doesn't just teach you knowlege in your courses that are suppose to be preparation for your career, but it's also a learning experience for life lessons. I feel that just in the week and a half that I have been here I have already become more responsible and determined.

NaN,"All I can really think about is how incredibly tired I am. My sleeping schedule has been severely altered. I stay up until 1:00 or 2:00 every night studying, then to get up at 7:00 or so to go to class. Surprisingly going back to the discussion in class, I am not especially stressed although I never seem to be. The only thing I ever stress about in Jason, Mandi, and some of my other troubled friends. Jason really is the source of all my stress right now (little as it is). I worry about him all the time. Not that I don't think he can take care of himself, because he is incredibly independent. I just think that maybe if I worry about it, it will do some good. There's my logic as usual it's very skewed. I am so incredibly tired. I can't help but think that if anyone reads this, they must be thinking that I lead the most unproductive life at UT. This really isn't the case. I just tend to sleep during the day, leaving all my studying to be done at night, and then stay up late doing that it's a vicious cycle of, well, laziness I suppose not necessarily unproductive. People can be lazy and still manage to be productive; there is a difference. This difference is vaguely present in my mind, and in my state of complete exhaustion, I am not capable of articulating it. I can't even make a coherent sentence describing my inability to articulate. I have Biology in an hourI don't want to go, but I know I will. I haven't developed that skill that comes to every college student. The one where you can miss class, and not panic, or feel remotely guilty for wasting your parents' money. I suppose this is a good thing though. I am staring at the foam brain resting on my computer speaker. There is something strangely humorous about it again; I can't even begin to articulate what it is. Just a foamy brain, portables, small, and somehow humorous. My sense of humor is rather odd. I have gathered this from several sources: the fact that Monty Python is the greatest series ever made, the fact that foam brains are hilarious, and the fact that I can laugh at anything without having any real reason.

NaN,"was a shock to realise a few years ago, that they had all   been jealous of me. I sure do miss high-school. Sometimes I think   that was the happiest time of my life -even with all the ons of   problems I had. Living at home with mama and Poppa was so hard   sometimes, but I had my friends, and it seems as if even Sulanka   loved me more at that time. To be fair, he also didn't see me 24   hours a day when we were in high-school either! I loved hanging out   with my friends, I've never laughed so hard as when I was in   highschool. It was nice being known by everyone. I miss my click, I   can't wait to see Ash and Ramee and hopefully Sashi in the winter.  I'm sure Senny must be going through the same things now. I feel   so bad for him, but being a tyypical boy, I can't ask hi to talk to me,   his sister, about any feelings. Then again. even if I did, I'd have no   idea about what to do if he broke down. That boy's badder than I   thought he was! He always looks so innocent and sweet, but deep   down, he's a real bad-ass! And mama and Poppa think I was the   flighty kid. Sometimes I wonder if I really am happy with what I've   become. I don't dare talk about it to anyone because everyone thinks   I'm perfect. My bosses, my parents, my friends and co-workers. If I try   to talk to Sulanka about these feelings, he just belittles me, so I   really have no one to talk to. I could talk to  mama, sometimes I wish   I did, but then, she expects so much from me, and I'm so sure she'll   scoff at my worries. She treats me as though I was still an   impetuous child, in need of being humoured. I wish I could make   her see me seriously someitmes. So many people are expecting   me to do well, they depend on me to do them proud. I feel like my   grasp on things os slowly slipping away. What am I going to do   when I graduate? Will I ever amount to anything? Will I ever make   mama happy with me and feel as though I have fulfilled her dream? I   miss Poppa.

NaN,"I wonder if Jeff will like the game. It is a shooter type game and does have a fun factor that is pretty high but will it last us until Playstation 2. Maggie. I want to see her again. Hopefully a couple of weeks from now. I am starting at 4:23 so 4:43 is when I will be finished. This wristband is the most stupid idea and it sucks that I can't take it off. I have to get up really early on Thursday to get my tickets to the game. Jeff and I will go to Target well maybe not. We will look at the magazine for a while or on the internet and see if we can find some games. Why the hell did I turn the fan on it is so cold. I don't know what to do for dinner maybe I will read before hand so that we can watch Highlander. I should ask Grace if she wants to eat with us. Damn only 4 minutes have gone by. That whistling noise needs to be fixed but I guess I'm already used to it. Mike I must call Mike about the DBZ movies. Maybe when I have some money duh. Why the hell did I bring that statuette. I could easily fit it in with my stuff. I want to be laying next to Maggie and want her to be with me all the time. This cell phone thing is going to be expensive. Good the light is still flashing. Man its really hard mapping your own thoughts. Once I find a thought to write about my mind concentrates upon writing it down instead of just free thinking. Carpet is nice. It would suck not to have it the room would be colder than it already is. I probably need to wash my clothes soon I am running out in my drawers. Why is my keyboard making this strange thumping sound when I hit the space bar. It never did that before. Maybe because I am alone and there is no other. What's up Amar. Amar just came in. Someone standing behind you is really annoying. Ha ha. Jeff will be back at five. We need a new game. Sleeping with my girlfriend was great. Damn my morals! Windows sucks my ass. Sit down and play some games. 4:38 sweet! Yes my air vent is really annoying. Pool would be cool. Yah I played pool in a while. Not really that good. You have your own stick bastard. I didn't know you have to have your own here that sucks. Come back soon. Oh well at least he is nice. I so badly want to have sex with Maggie but my religion and morals, life tells me not too. It would ruin both our lives. We could do it protected but there is too much risk. The amount of pleasure is not as great as the amount of possible pain, suffering, and problems we could incur.

NaN,"just found that so fascinating and I couldn't believe that someone had never met a HIndu. That kinda shows how segregated we all are and how we tend to stay within our same culture and try not to stray to far from it. I mean I have many friends who are not Indian and I have no prooblem with any kind of race, but I do have to admit that I do tend to be better friends and stay closer to those of the smae culture. I think this is true of a lot of peopel and not just me. But there are very few who are willing to accept this fact. One thing that does annoy me abotu this is how some people treat me liek I'm stupid until they learn that I was born in America. I see a lot of racism with my parents because they do have an accent and that really gets me mad. If anyone is ever disrespectign my mother in front of me I will let them know and trust me I am not soft spoken. I don't' know where people get off thinking that they are better than us. My parents came from India with very little money and now if I may say so my self we are probably more successful than those fools who feel that they have to show that they are better than us. Anyways, on to a more lighter topic, psycology. have I mentioned that I think that it is one of my favorite classes even though there is 500 people in it.

NaN,"So yesterday my boyfriend from A&M came down to Austin to celebrate our 9 month anniversary. It was a lot of fun but I stayed up late so I'm pretty tired. I hate that feeling of no energy and I just want to sleep but I know I can't because I am so stressed out. I am still really adjusting to college life. It's is so different from high school and its not all that it's worked up to be. I really like all the freedom, along with everyone else, but I am finding out that its hard to keep up on my studying. I am only taking 14 hrs. , which is supposedly and easy load, but I feel so bogged down. I tell myself I am go into catch up on the weekend and it never happens because other things come up. I have so much I want to do but there are not enough hours in the day. But everyone says this is what a lot of college students feel like and it will take time for me to adjust. I just don't hope it will reflect in my grades. I thought I had a calculus test next Friday, but I came to find out today that it is nest Wednesday. That is really scary. Bit I took calculus my senior year in high school so I feel I know some of the stuff. Everyone studies hardcore for tests, which I am pretty nervous about. I don't really do to much homework in that class because I have so much to do in my other classes. I really hope I'm doing the right thing on this paper and that every other student doesn't type super fast so my paper looks really short and that I didn't try. Anyways, I have a problem with the nest football game which is TX vs. Rice. I didn't realize they sold the tickets so early. I guess the draw started yesterday. I want to go but I haven't really met a lot of close friends to go with. This guy friend from high school wants me to go but I really want to go with a big group of people. I have never been to a large football game. Actually the only games I have gone to have been my high school games. But my high school had like 3,000 people so it was a big school. A lot of the seniors from our school went to A&M because it's only an hour away. I don't know why they would want to go and pass up living in the city like this. I am originally from California, which was so pretty, and Houston isn't the prettiest place in the world. I forgot so sign off instant messenger and people are trying to talk to me. It is getting really annoying. Seems like that is a such a popular way to communicate with people now. I like it but some people are obsessed with it.

NaN,"I feel strange because I'm in a world of completely new things. I tell myself that is all the same from any other people or situation, and it is in a way because if I always look at myself from an aerial view I will only see myself as one of the others, that we are all masses of tissue. But this is difficult because I know that I am myself, in a sense, and that really, everything will happen to me and the only way I can interpret the stimuli is by the way it comes to me, pertains to me. I don't want to be selfish, in the other respect of that word, but by thinking about myself I know that I therefore am selfish. I was depressed for a few days because I did not want to let go of another person. It was so much bullshit that I just finally sat on the roof and sorted everything out, looking at the stars. I came to the conclusion that I didn't need that right now, and that I was only cheating myself by believing this. It is strange because I have such problems with that. I realized recently that I have not reached the belonging. stage of life. Or maybe I reached it by not even trying, when I was very small, but I think ever since school started in kindergarten, as far as I can remember school wise, so maybe I have recessed back under that level of substantial importance. I'm having trouble being myself because I know that I don't even know myself. I do in a sense, but I sometimes think that it is just what I want to tell myself I'm like, and that I try to make myself the person that I think other people will like to see. Then I think that has everything to do with the belonging. factor. I am ultimately working towards self actualization. But I'm trying to be realistic in thinking that it won't be until I'm older like in my thirties. But it doesn't have to be that way. I don't want to feel like I can't do something, but I think how young I am and I think that I'm still just a little kid, and that I will have to work on this a lot more. I don't want to accept myself so I don't let others accept me. Its so hard, and winding. but now I know what I have to do, I have to find what it is that will make me chill out and respect myself and others.

NaN,clueless. Its embarrassing. but I guess I'm not the only one. Some people didn't know the answers either. The only thing is that in the class there's all these engineering majors completely engrossed in calculus they seem to understand everything. the class would be tons easier if I knew someone in there to help me. but there is morty. he's in a diff class but he says he'll help me. He's so freaking nice. he helps out a lot and hangs out with me even though I can be boring haha. I think he feels bad for me because I'm not adjusting as well as him to college. he's having like the time of his life . So many friends and places to go. I should keep my self busy so I won't get so lonely. I'm joining clubs and stuff but that makes me nervous. I want to run for office but its so scary for some reason. I have second thoughts about everything I have no idea why. I wonder where my roommate went. She works out everyday. Its inspiring I should too. I'll go to the gym. Haha I'll try who knows if I actually will. I went once and really liked it but I just have to find time. It seems like I have boatloads of work. but college is good. I'll get through it. I just don't know why people say its the best time of their lives. so far it just seems alright. Who knows I still have at least 4 years . I'm so sleepy. 5 more minutes of this and then calculus. No time to sleep. Ooh I need to watch RNC tonight. I missed last night but Laura bush was there. It might of been interesting even though I'm not much for republicans. everything lately is so political. its funny. in every class discussion there is some mention of elections. like in psychology the polls were really interesting. how people afraid of death are more likely to vote for bush. who knows if its actually true but I think there's some validity to it. sigh. I'm going home this weekend. I'm excited. I'm getting a ride from a stranger kind of so its weird. Haha that's what's cool about being Indian. parents can always find some other Indian kid to drive you home. oh well. I'm so tired there's only 2 minutes to go.

I think that there are a lot of interesting and wonderful things that each person is offered in their life time and I think that it is a shame if people don't take advantage of the things that they are given. At this moment, I am happy and cheerful and I don't have anything that is bothering me. It rained today and I didn't like it, but I wasn't too upset about it because I figured that we could use the rain. It also felt cool outside so the rain really didn't bother me too much. I also have a lot of homework that I need to get done, but I think that I have handled the stress very well. Even though I have many different things to do, I have tried to pace myself and organize myself as to where I have less tension in my life. I try to organize myself based on what I think is convenient and this helps me be a more efficient person, and thus causes me to stay in a pretty good mood. During the past three weeks I have often thought about the new life that I live here at UT. It is completely different from high school, and even though it has taken a lot of adjustment on my part, I am beginning to see the benefits of college and I am beginning to enjoy myself a little more. At first I was really scared about attending college. I don't think it was anything specific about college, just the whole concept of moving away from home and being without the people that I love most in my life. But, since the beginning of school, I have been able to cope with this type of anxiety a little better and I feel that even though I have left home, I have a chance to start a whole new life here at UT. I will always be able to see the people that I love and I have accepted the fact that I will be able to see them whenever I want, and this has helped me in enjoying the college life better. There aren't very many different feelings that I usually feel in a day. For the most part, I am usually in a pretty good mood and I see myself as a fun person to be around. I try not to let the little things bother me, because I see so many people who let the small things in life ruin their entire day. My philosophy is why let one bad thing ruin all the good things that you have in life. This is why I usually try not to let too many things bother me or stress me out, it just takes all the fun out of life.

NaN,"that she would normally include me in, and to top it all off, the relationship is not even healthy. I find it ironic that she gets mad at me when I talk to Richie, and feels that she can make whatever assumptions or claims about my relationship with him, but when I make the smallest remark about her and her boyfriend, she flips out. It doesn't seem all that fair to me. But then again, what is fair?  Is it fair that I want to be with someone that I can't have anymore? No its not fair, but thats the way that it will be. Sometimes I wonder if I will ever get a break; If maybe one day I'll get lucky and things will turn out the way I wanted them to, or if maybe Richie will wake up one day and decide that he wants to be with me and not with the girl he is with right now. Sometimes I wonder if my relationship with my mom will ever improve. She and I couldn't possibly be more different than we are. I can't even believe that I am her child sometimes. She acts so much like a child. If she doesn't get her way she mopes and she has to put me down to make herself feel better. She denies having made my sister depressed throughout her late childhood and early adultood. I think that its the subtle remarks about my figure, my study habits, my relationships that make me so mad at her. I want to tell her how I feel but she will retaliate and take something away from me that I need. She always used to do that in high school.

NaN,"Wow, the person next door has their music up too loud, but now they turned it down. I can't wait until the party tonight. I'm not normally excited about parties, my foot hurts, I moved it. Well, I'm at 50 sec. Hmm. there comes the music again. I don't like that kind of music otherwise it wouldn't bother me. What does Katie's computer say?  She was playing solitaire. My wrist itched and I scratched it. Is that how you spell scratched?  It doesn't look right. It's funny how simple words often don't seem like they're spelled right. Words like of. I could think of where the o key was, there I did it again. Two minutes and 31 sec. The green light on my router box is flashing. I guess, it's supposed to, though I would think a solid light would mean it was working right. I want to know who actually reads this kind of thing, or if it is read. It might be interesting, I suppose. I bet people write some pretty crazy stuff. I almost wrote shit there, but then realized that might be inappropriate, which is funny since I just made a comment that people might write crazy things in these types of papers. Particularly if they're crazy. I make my self laugh inside sometimes. Oh goodness, I'm making jokes with myself and my stream of consciousness paper. I had to look at the top of the stream to remember how to spell consciousness. 5 minutes and 16 sec. Wow, this is going by pretty quickly. The scroll bar just started. My headphones are sitting next to my computer. I'd like to be listening to some music right now, but of course, not my neighbor's music. Maybe John Mayer or Counting Crows, or Dave Matthews Band or I could get my new Rascal Flatts cd from my car. I really like every song on that cd. My dad called today. We haven't talked since I've been back here in Austin. I remember last year we talked about every other night for a while. I guess we are both just more adjusted to being apart. I'm very close to my dad. Wow, I'm writing as if I'm talking to someone now, which I'm not. I should stop that. Hmmm. deep breath in and out. Jordan. I wish he was on-line, I'd really like him to come to the party tonight. It should be fun. Phred will be there though, and he did say he might go to Houston with me tomorrow. That's nice of him, but I guess, maybe he owes me because I did take him home at 2 in the morning last night (this morning). Wow, someone could find out all the crazy shit, there I said it, about someone's life by reading these writings. Writing, I haven't written in my journals in a long time.

NaN,"""""""Stream Of Consciousness      As I sit behind this bleak, gray screen, I find myself wanting to yank my  dirty blonde locks of hair right out of their follicles. Sure, so far college has been a lot of fun. Why doesn't this program allow me to scroll down to  the next line without pushing """"""""enter""""""""? Am I supposed to keep on typing without pushing """"""""enter"""""""" until I hit some kind of barrier and can't type anymore?  Well,  I'm going to operate on the assumption that I should make my own right margin. Back to being completely stressed, I have so many things that I have to do  right now, that is, before tomorrow. So, why the heck am I doing this  assignment when I have until the 12th to turn it in?  I guess that's my nature. I tend to want to do the """"""""fun"""""""" things first. If my mother could see me now, she would freak. I wonder what would happen if I got my upper ear pierced?  I bet my mom would kill me. She nearly freaked out when I had my belly button pierced. I feel extremely guilty for having done that behind her back, but I  feel even more guilty for upsetting her and ruining my innocence in her eyes. My roommate wants me to pierce her ear for her. I honestly don't think that I am capable of inflicting that kind of pain on another individual. Sure, I can  pierce my own bellybutton, but when I see another person in pain, I feel twice as bad as they most likely do. Oh well, I'll just give Tracy the money to go  have it professionally done. This pushing """"""""enter"""""""" is really beginning to  frustrate me. I keep typing way over the right limit and having to erase and go back and re-type what I already typed. I think I need a computer. I  hate having to work and concentrate amongst all the hundreds of other people  here at the SMF (the Smurf. I smile everytime I hear that). I wanted to buy a computer, and I do have the money since I sold my motorcycle, not by my own  choice, but by my mothers. I realize that was a run-on sentence, but I'm not  about to go back and fix it. I wonder if anyone is actually going to read this or not. I'm just glad that I haven't had any demented thoughts since I have  started typing. Not that I have those often, but we all have certain weird  thoughts that we really don't care to admit having. At least, I hope so. I  bet whoever reads this is going to think that I'm a bad person. I'm really not. I like to think of myself as daring and thrill seeking. My mother likes to  think of me as unconventional and improper and borderline ignorant.

This pencil has been with me for about a year and I still have not lost it. I usually loose these pens and pencils within 3 or 4 weeks. My roommate just picked up the phone and started talking to a friend of mine. It seems that Texas just won the football game. I am happy to hear that. Again I am thinking what am I going to write for this assignment. Yes, I can type pretty fast but to write for 20 minutes, I really don't know what I will be saying?! I am a junior by hours at UT but I am actually a sophomore in electrical engineering. I work as a grader for EE316 class and I really like doing the job. Only thing is, I hate failing students but what can I do? If I don't, they will fail the other chapters to come. My roommate is laughing right now and distracting my thoughts from this assignment!

I really hope he does not interrupt me. I am feeling hungry now and I am getting tired for typing for a long time even though only about 10 minutes have passed. I wish the food was better for me to eat at the cafeteria. Unfortunately, the food is not great. My friend just called me but I am continuing writing. I told him to call me back in 15 minutes. Hopefully, I will be finished with this assignment. I can hear the conversation between my roommate and one of my friends over the phone. They are talking about going to 6th street. I probably would like to go but I think I need to call my brother and sister today. Anyway, that is life and I need to do all this work. I am really tired and now, my thoughts just don't flow anymore. I hear the bathroom toilet flush in the community bathroom. The room is suddenly cold and I wish I wasn't wearing shorts.

I wonder what the results of this experiment are going to be? What are they going to help with? I am really hungry and the only thing that is stopping me is this work.

It rained the whole way down here so instead of the usual three hour drive it turned into nearly four hours. My band practiced very well this weekend. We put in about four hours of practice. Our show this weekend was cancelled so instead we decided to practice. We did a little recording in my guitar player's garage. I stayed up very late yesterday just talking to some friends online. I had a huge burrito from Chipolte. I had never been there before so it was a surprise to see a burrito that big; however, I didn't really enjoy it because they put onions and peppers in it. I suppose it was my fault, because I told them what to put in it. I said I wanted fajita chicken and then started putting peppers and onions in the burrito. I thought the fajita part was the way the cooked the chicken. It turns out it was just the stuff they put in with the chicken. I didn't eat much of it, but I will still give the place a second chance. Now I know not to order that kind of burrito. My parents took my girlfriend and her friend out to dinner on friday night. We went to chili's off of F. M. 3040. After that we went to my girlfriend's house and just played the piano. We played for about two hours. I figured out how to play two new songs. One was a spanish song and the other was carol of the bells. We had no music, we were just going by ear. My girlfriend's friend was getting very annoyed because she did not want to play the piano. Instead she played cards with my girlfriend's family. Studying for college has not been going the way I would like it. I told myself I would stay caught up with all of my classes, but I seem to have fallen behind already with all of them. I just need to concentrate and read like a mad man.

I hope they don't make me do anything really weird I'm kind of hesitant to do that stuff oh wells I haven't been out a lot since I've been here in Austin I'm kind of homesick.

Its like every phase of my life is separate from everything else that has happened in my life. its hard to even think of middle school anymore, and even freshman year of high school seems like someone elses life.

I think the point of that class is to weird you out and show you that nothing is certain. . so as if you werent already clueless enough at this point in your life, now you have some class where they tell you nothing is for sure.

I thought I wouldn't be able to understand the professor at all, but surprisingly I understood him very well and I understood what he was talking about. It was a review over stuff we were suppose to have learned already, and it was all so familiar to me. I guess I really did learn something last year in Calculus. I did have a really good teacher and I did well on the Calc AP exam. I have to remember to write a thank you note to my high school professor. He was the coolest. He was so passionate about what he was teaching and he really got me into what he was discussing. I understood it very well and actually enjoyed it too. I wish I had teachers like him in other subjects I took in HS. M economics teacher was not to good. It was an AP course too and I really felt that I didn't learn much. Now I'm going to take an economics class in college. I hope I get the same relaxed feeling as in my business Calculus class. The professor seems pretty cool. And maybe others in the class had not so good teachers too, so they are at the same disadvantage as me. Either way I'm going to study hard and stay on top of things in my class, so I can eventually do well. If there's one thing I learned in High School, it's to stick with it. Starting out in high school, all I wanted was the easy way out, because the experience was so overwhelming to me and it was too scary. But at the end I started to see the big picture that in the end it is all worth it. In the end I will get a good grade trough all the hard work I put forth and then I can have that satisfied feeling that I did good and all my work paid off, so I must continue it. So I got in the habit of working my hardest and hoping to see the good result that are so satisfying to see. I usually get to see those results I so desperately work for but if not I work even harder the next time so I can finally see the results I was looking for. My High School was extremely competitive and I managed to keep up and just make it in the top ten percent. I'm very proud of myself, and where I am today.

"""""""" So with that said, I ask myself, """"""""Why am I here?"""""""" I guess the reason for everyone to go to college is to make a higher salary than someone who doesn't go. If that is true then why is it that some of the richest people in the world did not go to college? Michael Dell is a prime example. He is not your everyday college dropout. He is making more money than probably 97 percent of college graduates. So is college a way of evening everyone out? Someone could have had big dreams of starting their own business and carrying out the American Dream; whereas someone else could be forced to go to college by their parents, end up graduating in the middle of the class, but still hold the same kind of job as the person who wanted the American Dream, but got it spoiled by being """"""""brainwashed"""""""" in college. So what exactly does """"""""brainwashed"""""""" mean? Everywhere I have been in college, there are professors talking about, """"""""When you graduate, you can get a job at a big important firm and then you'll be set for life. """""""" NONSENSE. I don't want to work for someone. Nevertheless, everyone starts to agree with these statements and go to a business, get an ok  paying job, settle with where they are, and never look back to see where they took the wrong turn.

NaN,"Well, lets see . . . I guess the foremost thing I have on my mind is moderate confusion about what exactly I'm supposed to be writing about. I guess that doubt and lack of confidence about what I'm suppose to be doing is a part of my thoughts and what not and thus is appropriate to write about. Hehe, now I feel confident and more sure of this whole writing assignment. Wow, how quickly my entire psychological outlook can turn 180 degrees. What else?  Im not hungry or anything, not really tired tomorrow. Im a little worried about whether Im going to be awake enough to pay attention in my 8 o'clock class tomorrow. I'm also a little preoccupied by something someone said to me today, labeling me as too quite and inaggressive in committing myself to just about everything. I guess they might be right, I am a little hesistant to get involved in anything I think might not work out or turn out as I expect. I was thinking about rushing for a couple of frats, but then I realized I didnt even know what they were about. I was caught up in the promise of brotherhood and having fun and being a part of something special, but then I realized I didnt know what I was getting in to and that I might not be able to get out if I changed my mind. Thus, I decided not to rush, perhaps because of the fear of commitment and unfulfilled expectations that someone stated dictates most of my actions, or perhaps because I had a valid thought in suspecting I really don't know much about what precisely the fraternity actually did or stood for, who knows?  What else am I thinkin about?  How about how much longer Im suppose to be writing for. I've been writing nine minutes and I havent really noticed. This assignment isnt as bad as I thought it would be and is actually kind of nice. Almost like a diary of my thoughts; definately good for venting. Man, I sure hope this is what I'm suppose to be doing. I hope I didnt entirely miss the purpose of this assignment and not ger credit. I mean, Im writing about my thoughts and stuff, which seems to deal with Psychology and the human mind, so I think Im doing good here, but Im really not sure. Man, I'm getting a little behind in my reading. A lot of the lectures in many of my classes seem to cover the text exactly so Im a little unmotivated to read. I know I should and I know there is some extra information in the book, but really Im just lazy or something. To be honest, Im unsure of what I need to do to succeed in college. I've yet to take a test or quiz so I don't really know what the deal is.

It's a thursday afternoon and all I'm doing is staying at the apartment to do this assignment. What a life! These stupid pop-ups keep on coming up, it's interrupting my thinking process. Let's see, I've been up here for about a month now, and I have yet been able to see and fun"""""""" that everyone that went here or is going here claim. It's not that I want to be partying everyday, still I would like to see what's all the fuss's about. Then again, my life here at the apartment is great. I live with two roommates, each have their own eccentricity, still without them I would be bored out of my mind. These restaurants around here keep on posting flyers in front of my door- it's getting really annoying. I'm hungry, yet I don't want to go grab something to eat - does that make me lazy? Of course not! It's because I have to sit here for 20 minutes to write this assignment, yea that's it. During the day this place is so quiet, almost everyone that's living here goes to UT, so during the day they're at the campus. Maybe I should spend more time at the campus. Maybe that would help me get to know more people. I haven't made one single friend yet, well besides those people that I see in class everyday, those that I greet with a casual hello; however, I don't think of them as friends, just acquaintances. My computer desk keeps on shaking while I'm typing this, I should have brought a sturdier desk, but then how would it fit in here? This place is so cramped. Luckily, this weekend I'm going back home to Houston to get a bunk bed, and also to see my family and girlfriend of course. I miss my family very much, especially my dad. He have always been the strict yet caring figure that shadows every minute of my life up till now. Now, I have to be on my own, that's the only way that I will learn to grow up. I know he must be worried out of his mind right now, wondering what I'm doing up here, wondering how my health is, wondering how I'm doing in school, wondering how late I sleep, wondering how many times I eat in a day, etc. I know he worries, but the best I can do is call him every night just to let him know that I'm doing fine. I can't go back home, if I live with him, then he will take care of everything for me, then I will never learn to grow up. I miss my mom too, but I'm more attached to my dad because he is the only other male in our family of seven.

Besides she doesn't have to shout it out I wonder if my roommate hear, now she is playing that damn music again. red hot chili peppers. I should really be reading my book for lit right now instead of doing this, I wonder if my watch is going to break again, broke twice today. I just bought that nice new one and I've hardly worn it. Don't want to mess it up with scratches and all. I still can't believe that about mom. She can be such a god-damn BITCH. I think she is calling to see how I am, and instead she just screams at me about the damn clinic. At least I avoided her questions pretty well, but she can still draw her own conclusions. I want to talk to Jenny. it's been a while since we've had a good talk. All she tells me about now is her boyfriend David. That relationship is trouble. She is not her own person anymore; she lives for him now. She doesn't even stay at home, is over at his place all day, lies to her mom, and uses ME as an excuse. Damn. I haven't talked to Penner in a while. I hope he is thinking about me. I need to call him and also send him his present. Hope he likes the card I picked out. it suits both him and me, so I thought it was perfect. I hope my cell phone doesn't crap out on me again it's so old and worthless. My arm is itching. I wonder if I should wear sunscreen tomorrow since I have been burning a little. trade off between cancerous skin damage and nice-looking tan skin God, I could use some coffee especially since I'll be up for a while reading all that stuff I hope punctuation doesn't count in this I don't think it does anyway. It's probably going to tell me how negative and depressed I am. I am not really, though I am pissed at mom and I hate that I am at UT Even the name conveys a sense of sheer stupidity. I worked my ass off for Berkeley and here I am in this hell-hole. I hate these damn community bathrooms, and I hate that the laundry room is so far away. God the last time I wrote this crazily was when I wrote that suicide note junior year of high school I hate that Granoff I hope he burns in hell for making my life fall to shit like that. If not for him, I might be in Berkeley right now instead, but grade aside, I can't forgive him for all the emotional damage he did When I read that note later, it made me cry to see how far into depression I had fallen.

But, it's perfectly reasonable, we're completely across the country,  I'm being ridiculous I know, it just ended so fast, and I'm still upset.

My shoulder is kind of starting to hurt, I think this is a really cool assignment, because it's just stream of consciousness, but it's taking forever, Agamemnon. That's what I say when I'm saying Aggh, or something, because it sounds cooler. I can't stop thinking about my girlfriend. I really think I have some sort of problem with dependence, I feel like I HAVE to be around people most of the time or I start to feel sort of depressed, like no one cares about me. This being away from some of my friends and alone in this new environment, is making things worse. My History of the Banjo teacher, that's a freshman seminar, told us we had to grow our nails out longer to play the banjo, and it's driving me crazy, because     I hate semi-long nails, they always feel dirty, and I can feel them now whilst I type, clacking against the keys, it's irritating. I think there's something wrong with my smell, I don't think I can smell anything. That wouldn't be surprising anyways, I think there's something wrong with everything about me and everything I do.

I am halfway done!   I am starting to calm down. I have never been to hot-headed. I try to keep a level head all the time.

I also like ken griffey jr, he seems like a team player that gives his all every game. mo vaughn is a very large man, he won't win any stolen bases titles anytime. only five minutes left. I like the expos and pirates, just because every year they are competitive even though they have no money to win with. they are building their team through the farm systems, which is how it should be done. I hope to get good grades. I wish this assignment was over. I love college football. I loved to play football but I never was big enough of fast enough to play up to the level I wanted to .

NaN,"I honestly have no earthly idea. I just woke up about 2 hours ago. Drop off my younger sister at her school, which is my old high school. My boyfriend is still a senior there. At times it is awkward going there but at the same time very comfortable. I brought my (old) teacher  a lot of buckets for the upcoming carnival for the little kids. I enjoy bringing her to school 1, because I remember how horrible bus rides were. So I never rode it. Actually I rode it 2yrs in middle school, because my mom could not drop me off. And secondly I get to see my Bert. It is weird being in a relationship, not because it is uncomfortable. More like it is a different experience. I never really had a relationship until my senior year. It really isn't hard balancing my priorities. My number one priority is finishing school. Hey, I realized that my typing isn't as bad as I thought. I still have to look at the keys at times. Back to Bert. He really is an extremely wonderful person, cute, good husband material( not that I am thinking about that right now) It's just that it really is hard to find someone genuinely nice and sincere to everyone, and especially you. I think it just sucks that he is my first true relationship. Because, the old notion that the first most likely isn't the last. Only time will tell. It's about 10:02 and I didn't go to work today. Instead, I am doing this lovely assignment. Excuse my typing, I am not that good. Oh, I know what else I am thinking. My big 18 B-Day is coming up, and my dad is still holding strict control over me. Like I am twelve all over again. He doesn't realize that I am growing up and staying home this year doesn't help. Although, I love my home and mother. I only wish certain straining attitudes would alter. My first class today is math 305G. oh, boy! My teacher is actually, pretty nice. Right now it  is much more of a review, and my homework assignment is due today also. There were only actually a few problems that I quite couldn't recall. I just have to practice on more problems. I am not at all surprised of my needed review. The problems were wonderful word problems which I have never seemed to master without practice. Well look here it is three minutes past my 20 minutes. and these people are becoming a little antsy (I think that is how you spell it) about time limits. Oh, if you actually do read any parts of these assignment  I HOPE YOU ARE READING THIS BECAUSE I JUST WAS THINKING THAT YOUR CLASS IS ACTUALLY ENJOYABLE.

NaN,"""""""So I'm laughing right now because I think this is really weird. Makes me feel kind of uncomfortable I guess, I don't know why though. But my stomach kind of hurts right now, my roommate and I just had some ice cream, so maybe that's why. I'm kind of stressed right now, and I hope I get everything I need to get done done tonight. I'm really tired and I just want to go to bed. I'm really hot in my dorm, maybe I should turn the fan on, but I'm too lazy to get up and do that right now. So I'm wondering what my boyfriend is doing right now. I talked to him a few minutes ago and he was doing homework. I wonder what homework he has?  Man, I'm really not looking forward to tomorrow. I have so much stuff to do, at least that's what I feel like. And I really want to go to TOPS to look at the pictures. Hopefully Claire will go with me tomorrow and do that. My foot is really itching me, I think I got bit by a bug tonight at the ZETA house. I was outside doing my homework which was probably not a good idea, but oh well. Oh I need to call my parents too. I wonder if they're having a good time in Canada. I wish I was there right now. I miss them already, but I'm only three hours away so it's okay. I'll be fine. I really want to go running outside on the track tonight. It felt so good out earlier and I bet that would help with my feeling stressed out. But I probably won't because I'm so tired and my stomach still hurts. I wonder what's wrong with it. Twenty minutes is a long time, I've only been writing for seven minutes now, wow. I hope I have fun this weekend. I'm excited about the UT football game. The last game was so much fun even though it was raining. I guess that made it more interesting. I'm looking at my pictures by my desk now and I really miss my friends from my hometown. I really miss Angie, I hope she is doing fine at Kingwood College. And Justin, I hope he is still not mad at me. Maybe I should call him tomorrow, I think I will. And I can't believe Kristin got her nose pierced up in Colorado. She is a wild one, but I guess that makes her who she is. I wish I was in Colorado. I love the mountains and the nice weather there. I bet she is having a great time at school. I'm spacing out right now. I never thought I could have writer's block when I'm writing about what's going through my head. That's really weird. And I'm saying really"""""""" a lot.

NaN,"How can anyone ever trust words?  They give us so little to go on. Try describing an experience you had to someone else. They'll hear your words, take them to mean something, then perhaps if your experience was interesting they'll attempt to pass it on to someone else, but all they have to go on is your original words, remembered imperfectly, thus if they're asked to elaborate they cannot. Divorced from your own head, your own experiences this same thing could happen to you as an individual as opposed to spanning people. The impossible to deny separation of the observer and the observed defies the unity each of us feels exists in the world. I am the universe and I act in the universe. I can view only so much of it and wow this has gone to quite an odd part of my head. Let's try some meditation. You hide, they seek. Sound should precede action, light should precede all, but that is not always the case. Instantaneous data transfer thru entanglement disrupts causality. This is as true now as it will be now. Hahaha. oops. I don't know what it means. My ass hurts. I should shift or something. That's better. I think I forgot what I was supposed to be thinking about. Don't take points off, please, haha.

I should have a   Drawing of the day   or something silly like that. Yeah, maybe of the week so I won't have to do so much. I prolly shouldnt' have typed that bit about today's quote, considering she is standing like a couple of feet behind me. Man sometimes I am so evil, but deep down I believe I am good. Oh my goodness, I am only halfway done. Do I have to keep writing like this?  I'm not sure if I really think about stuff this often. I may be just searching for topics to write about.

He's a pretty funny guy but I am really trying to come up with a good joke to really bust his chops. I am also thinking about  how depressed everyone is today, being September 11th and all. I wonder how Sept. 11th will be in like 50 years. I also wonder how long it will take for it to get into student's text books. I hope they don't do the same thing that they did for Pearl Harbor and Titanic, and make a love story out of it. That's rediculous, there is more to it than some guy going off to work while his wife is at home and his lover is at his secret apartment. I bet a lot of people will be angry if someone manages to come up with one. I would hate to be President Bush now. He has some tough decisions to make. Half of the country says: Kill 'em all! While the others are screaming:   PEACE.   No matter what, someone will not get what they want. Even in the West Mall today, there are tons of people speaking their opinion, showing signs and passing out ribbons. But it's not totally black and white. I think there is a grey area. Some people say war and some say peace, but I think we can find some in-between. Killing innocent children isn't a good idea but we have to stand up for ourselves if we want this to stop. I don't know. . I don't like talking about politics or religion. Too much controversy. Everyone is too stubborn to see the sides of others. I am also thinking about when I was here in the computer lab yesterday. Some girl started crying really loud in the hallway. It was just like out of the movies. None of us knew what was going on. Some people got up and went to see, which (although curious myself) I thought was rude. I went to my kickboxing class last night. It really makes me feel self-confident. Learning those moves last night was a lot of fun. Why isn't the time and minutes thing doing anything? I am afraid that I will have to do this all over again. I am looking around the room and noticing that just about everyone here is checking their email. I guess no one does work on computers!!!  I like coming in here to check my email but I always feel like someone is reading what I am typing behind me. If they want to know so bad, they should just ask. I am very tired. I went to bed late, and slept through my alarm. But somehow I still made it to my 9:00 class. Barely! That class is fun. Learning sign language is very important I think.

NaN,"Moving here to Austin has had me thinking about all sorts of things, about my life in general. These past few weeks, I have been analyzing about every aspect of my life. I am constantly running countless memories of my life by home through my mind. As excited as I am to be here, and I much as I dislike the city I moved from, I cannot help but miss my friends and family and all that I left behind. I am not the most outgoing of people and I find it difficult to strike up conversations with random people, therefore prolonging any new friendships. I love this city, though and I am trying to come out of my shell and be the fun loving, loud girl I was back home. My friends and family back home reassure me it will only be a matter of time before I begin to feel right at home and have a whole new hoard of friends, but until then, I feel very lonely. My roommates on the other hand are worse off than me. The three of them are all friends of mine from back home. They all have boyfriends with who they are in constant contact with. They are eternally homesick and pretty much no fun whatsoever. I am a person who finds it difficult to hang around the house all day, but they on the other hand do not even want to go out to explore the city. So they are a big drag in my social life. Hopefully by the end of the year, I will have gotten them to enjoy party life at least half as much as I do, that is if I can tear them away from their cell phones for more than five minutes. All this time at home has allowed me to build up a nice collection of songs from the internet, and enjoy all the benefits the internet has to offer. I have been able to chat with friends near and far in length without any phone charges, which is always nice. Yes I am very happy to be here in Austin, but I just want this transitional phase to fly by so I can feel right at home. I am not even so much homesick as I am just lonely. With my circle of friends limited I do not have much to do except things on my own. Perhaps that is not such a bad thing, seeing as how I am doing some definite soul searching on my long lonely walks and my hours spent at bookstores, and libraries.",stream of consciousness,0,1,436,21.8,11.24,82.57,13.07,10.32,0,10.32,0,2.06,1.83,0.23,4.36,17.43,0.69,6.19,3.44,0.92,0.46,2.75,0,0,1.61,4.82,0.46,1.38,1.83,0.23,2.52,2.52,1.38,0.23,0.23,0.92,7.8,1.38,2.06,2.06,0.46,0.92,3.9,2.06,11.24,1.38,3.67,1.38,0.23,6.65,3.21,1.61,1.61,1.15,0.23,0.23,3.44,2.98,0.23,0,0.23,0.23,0.46,0.46,0,0.69,0.46,0.23,0,0,0,0,0,0,8.49,4.59,3.9,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

I was just thinking the other day why it is that people especilly women ,girls, always like to sleep with stuffed animals? I personaly have never really felt the need to until recently. It is comforting, taking the place of something or someone that is missing from life.

I love people so easily. I know that we are flawed with imperfections and sometimes when I see someone as they really are, when there are not hiding behind and image it is easy to love them and see how other's love them and why god loves us.

I don't want to be afraid of it because I still believe that good will overcome but it scared me to see that way that society seems to just accept everything, good and bad. I think we should acknowlege it's existence but condemn it as well. It seems so easy just lose yourself in it and I see people do it all the time.

I find it kind of hard to just type out all of my thoughts, considering that there are hundreds of random thoughts every minute(or it seems). Phones ringing. cell phones. yuck. Interruptions. I knew that would happen. I don't think I'm capable of having twenty minutes of silence to type something. All I know is that I am really really hot which will probably affect my thinking. I'm naturally a """"""""hot natured"""""""" person, and my sister's room is really hot. So hot I'm sitting here sweating and I'm barely moving my body. My room is just as hot though. I'm just hot all the time. I wonder what affects it really does have on me. I know it makes me grumpy sometimes. Especially if I'm hungry at the same time. That's just a bad position to be in hot, sweaty, and hungry. No matter how low I turn are air conditioner, I'm still burning hot. Not to mention our electricity bill that makes me just as hot! But I guess I don't have any room to complain. I couldn't ask for anything more in my life. I have everything I've ever wanted and more! I accidentally meet my boyfriend and he just makes everything even better than it was. He makes me see things that I would have never seen before. He really has made a difference in my life. Thank you, thank you, thank you God. I wonder how my mom is feeling? Her surgery was last week, so I'm sure she doesn't feel as bad as she did. Since she was at work a couple days later, I guess she must not have felt too bad. But she is a strong woman the strongest woman I've ever known. I'm proud to say that. Very proud. I guess you kind of' start missing your parents when you leave for college and you're far from home. But I am lucky to have an older sister(who I live with) and I've always gotten to follow behind her, making her do everything first. That's made my life a heck of a lot easier. I do miss my bed and my dogs. Not to mention my home. But I'll be going home soon, so I'm ready to go. I'm ready to introduce my boyfriend to my parents and grandmother too. That should be fun! I know it will go well though. I also wonder if my sister's car will be out of the shop, because I wanted to leave earlier than my sister.

I thought I would be feeling more tired and exhausted, but It has not hit me yet. This morning, while watching CNN, and still seeing the coverage of Princess Diana, made me sad. It makes me think why everyone in that crash died and the bodyguard did not. He had ten hours of surgery. What pain I thought. I kept on asking myself why did G-d let him live. Why not someone like Princess Diana who did so much for the world and has two young boys to help grow up. She did so much for other people. She even raffled her dresses of for charity. What a women. I'm feeling a little bit tired now. The psy experiment I did today was a fun experiment. I enjoyed it. I sat next to a cute girl. I hope today's classes will go fast. I would like to take a nap today. Just to sleep and rest for an hour. It was nice seeing one of my brothers in my fraternity on campus today. It was a nice surprise. Also, I saw one of my friends from home on campus. It is exciting walking home from campus or going a different route because of the unexpected people you see or new or old friends you see. My mother went on business and I hope she is doing well. I hope she got well rested today. I hope to talk with my sister and she how well she is doing. I try to put myself in a better mood everyday. I think about a lot of things and it gets me worried. An example is I worry about friends, family, grades, whether I am behind or don't understand something in a class. I also do not like change. I don't like a change in atmosphere or any change whatsoever. Like going home this summer was hard because of a change in atmosphere and a change in obeying my parents again with a curfew etc. I try to get along with all my fraternity brothers, but sometimes I feel it is harder than normal. I spoke with my mother and she says you can't be friends with everyone. I have so much to thank for but I feel that I am always asking G-d to help me in a situation. I enjoy life and enjoy the pleasures it gives me. I enjoy school and friends. I feel everyone has there moods and their times they feel good and bad. I had a very rough summer due to the fact that I had irritable bowel syndrome. It was very painful and I did not like the pain. A doctor prescribed me some medication. What upsets me is that one of my friends I feel is rude at times.

NaN,"""""""I don't really know how to start a """"""""stream of consciousness"""""""" writing, but I guess I will write about how I feel about college right now. It is my first year and it is really scary but fun at the same time. I guess I haven't really had enough time to sit down and think about all that I have done since I have been here. It is exhausting to think how much I have actually been doing. I'm not a morning person so my days start around 11:00. From that point on I do not stop until about 23am, when I pass out. My days are filled completely with going to class, studying, meetings, and then of course going out. I have met so many people since I have been here. I barely remember anyone's name. I feel so bad when someone comes up to me and calls me by my name and I can't even remember ever meeting them. I'm sure that has happened to everyone before, but it seems to happen to me at least once a day. Oh well, life goes on. At least I remember my roommate's name. She is cool! We both went potluck and got extremely lucky. We get along like sisters, and people even think we look alike. It's crazy. This writing seems like a bunch of gibber gabber but I guess I am following the guidelines by writing what is on my mind. I think this is a cool exercise because it is actually giving me the time to sit down and think about what's on my mind. One thing that is always on my mind is how I miss home. I am used to my mom always taking care of almost everything for me. That makes me sound like a baby, but I am an independent person. I took care of my mom for two years while she was in bed sick. That was the point in my life when I grew up really fast. I had to go to work and school, cook dinner, go to the cleaners, and everything that I could do to help out around the house. When she got better, I guess is when I became lazy and wanted her to help me do a lot of things. She is awesome and I really miss her. My dad is an entire different story. He lives in Connecticut and does not do one thing for anybody except himself. He didn't raise us so he doesn't really know how to act like a father. My step dad is the man who acts as my father. He takes care of me the way my father is supposed to. I really miss him as well. If it weren't for him I would not be typing this essay on this computer, or going to the University of Texas as well. I am very thankful for everything he has done for me. I am bad at showing it sometimes, but I think he knows in my heart how appreciative I am.

NaN,"I feel really good today because it is my birthday. I'm looking forward to being with my friends later on today. I'm thinking about tonight because my fraternity is having a match with the ZETAs. I'm pretty excited about it because they are the hottest girls I've seen so far. I kind of would like to go home though and see some of my friends back home. A lot of them are making trips back home this weekend to see some concert. I also would like to see my family on my birthday but I am sure I will see them soon. I don't really know what else I should write about except my birthday because it's all I have been thinking about this week. I plan to go pre party after I finish this writing assignment. So far I am loving it here in Austin and am really glad I chose to come school up here. The size of my classes is quite a surprise and something I just have to get used to. I really enjoy having all the freedom here compared to back home in Houston. I wish I had more time to just hang out but I stay really busy lately. Being a pledge in a fraternity really can be time consuming but it is worth it. I've met so many people these last three weeks and I'm sure it will be the same for the rest of the semester. Now I'm beginning to draw blank and can't think of much to write. Oh well, it's not like anyone will actually read this passage. I've got five minutes left on my time.

NaN,"Ummm. haven't done this since 8th grade. Thinking always gets ahead of the recording. Allergy's in the air, uncomfortable contacts. Gregg's still here, said he was going to the store. Grammar's gotten lax. Cats on the couch. At least they're not playing. Place is messy-I should clean but I probably won't. Twenty minutes is a rather long time. Is that to get to the truer feelings?  After getting too bored for anything else in 10?  I had a feeling that was the purpose of the 1. 5 hour questionaire. I don't know if I spent 1. 5 hours, but it took forever. And I started the questions too late at night. After answering pages of them I didn't want to back out. Have a   Foam Party   experiment scheduled Friday. I'm peeved that they didn't give you any idea what you were signing up for. Is it necessary not to fill in the participants?  And my vision isn't 20/20. It's not terribly far from, but I hope they don't check and kick me out. I never use this desk (the one at home) and it's filled with papers and trash that isn't mine. I hate stacks of other people's paper. Filled with cryptic scribbles. I don't feel like I can throw it out, but the odds of it being valuable are pretty slim. Strip Tease with Demi Moore is on cable tonight. I've never seen it, but I watch 20 minutes of it tonight but decided to turn it off. I'm trying to watch less crap tv, but it seems like that's all there is lately. I wonder when the new season starts?  I should try to watch something other than Fox this year. It's easy to get locked into one network if you only see that networks commercials. But if I'm only going to watch one, I guess it should be something other than Fox. My typing has gotten pretty decent. I used to type 35-40 wpm, but typing at work has improved that. Most of my practice though is personal email at work. I waste way too much time online instead of working. It's just so easy with the way my computer faces. I wonder how obvious it is though. I'm rambling, but I feel like I'm suppose to be talking to someone. I say   used   and   supposed  . I'm fairly sure that's wrong (but not sure, which is sad). I always say it, and I can live with that, but I type it too, and can never decide if I should make a change or not. Gregg said he was going to the store. I'm paranoid about him reading it for some reason. He just walked up behind me and started to read some, and I asked him not to. It's silly-there's nothing in here that he doesn't already know.

NaN,"So, it's a Tuesday night, and there's nothing to do. I ate dinner earlier and can   feel the food digesting. I am rather anxious about something. Not terribly that it is   distracting, but I feel as though I am expecting something. It might be that I am   nervous about school. It's a new place for me, coming from Minnesota. I haven't   really made my close group of friends. Sure, I've been having loads of fun, but I   still don't have that complete feeling of acceptance yet. I haven't found my niche.   It's almost like I am waiting for it to be a month from now when I've found my place.   It's also hard in class, becuase I don't know many, hardly any at all, people in   them. I don't have people where I can go to work on projects or anything. This   makes me a little worried about how I am going to do, becuase I can't compare   answers on homework with friends, and I can't discuss new concepts with anyone.   I think that the move to a toally new placed this past month has been a little more   stressful than I originally expected. But I am not worried because there are so   many people here that I know it can't be too long before I find my place. Austin is a   great city also. That's a definite plus. The city has just a great atmosphere. I've   seen two concerts here and I love it. I can't wait to see even more of the city and   it's cool places. Music is a big part of my life and I think that is really going to make   me happy. It's great to know that just about every week there will be a concert or   something I will love to do. I am really excited to get to know some of the local   musicians. That'll be cool. I also have feelings that I want to have a girlfriend. I don't really know what I want   sexually. I feel like I want a steady girlfriend. Someone who I can always be close   with. I really think that will help make my transition into Texas easier. But it's hard   for me to find someone who I'll get along with this well. Another thing I think about   is committment. I dont' know if I want a long term relationship. Also, would it be to   distracting for be because of school?  I certainly know that school is my priority, but   now that I'm in college, I have to discover how much time I really need to spend   doing work to maintain my GPA. I think that the first semester is the hardest   because it's a new atmosphere",stream of consciousness,0,1,451,12.89,13.53,84.7,17.74,12.64,0,12.64,0,0.22,2.88,0.22,4.88,11.09,0.44,3.33,2,0.67,0.67,1.33,1.11,0,0,10.2,1.55,4.88,3.1,0.44,3.33,1.11,2,0.44,0.22,1.11,3.55,0.22,0.89,0.89,0,0.67,3.99,1.77,19.07,2.88,3.77,0.44,0,5.76,5.54,0.89,2.44,1.77,0.44,0.67,1.11,0.22,0,0,0.89,0.22,0,0,0,1.11,0,0.67,0.44,0,0,0,0,0.44,16.63,7.32,3.1,0,0,0.22,0,0,0,5.99,0,0,0

I'm pretty sure that I have done that as he tells me that he is proud of me. i sure saw it in his face the day that I got my acceptance letter. i've never really seen my father cry before. but I think he  almost did when I yelled out that I'm going to be a Longhorn!!  That's something that I will never forget. the look on his face and the look on mom's.

I npticed Mark has taken a liking to Bond and he always plays it while on my bed. I can't belive he was sick and lying in my bed. All this and the fact that he can't make a joke well make me want him to hook up with Emily. They were made for each other. He does have a sense of homur thought. Atleast he isn't to weird a roomate. I do feel bad that I haven't taken out the trash yet. OIther than that I think I have been a good roomate. I think I made him jealous when Sarah and I were kding around. I could feel him shutting himself off from us and dwelling on his own sorrow that I am still convinced is caused by the fact that Emily and him are apart. I hope my relationship will prosper. Some changes need to be made on my controlling attention and Sarah trying to do the same. I don't belive the problems lie much more deeper than that, Altough I am looking at it from that perspective as well. I think if we continue to become aware of our prior mistakes happiness will prevail. We do have a good future if we have a liittle more personal attention and inner thought.

If people would check out the TV schedule than maybe they could plan when to watch certain shows and when to do other tasks like reading a book of interest. Speaking of books, I have but a thousand to read. The Hobbit, Lord of the rings, that Star-Wars book, that buddism one, the Tenth Insight, The experiential guides and the Celestine Vision. I also want to read the bible for my own study and not because it was being forced on me. I don't believe in the present idea of God but see him more as just energy of which everything is made. Perhaps the tales will have some metaphoric meaning within my life as it has my parents. I still doubt that I will pick Christianity as my system of metaphors.

I usually don't feel this nervous but since this year  counts so much with medical schools I feel that top performance is . what's a good word?  ummm. My mind is drawing a blank. essential?   well good enough. I feel I must perform beyond my own goals. hmm. well I don't really agree with that statement. I just feel I need to  do good.

I love working out, but nowadays I donÔøΩt have much  time b/c I live off campus and commuting and parking takes too much time  that I just run at home sometimes, if I find a running buddy. the  nervousness is gone, but it left a massive headache. massive, I like that  word its sounds so cute  when English people say it with their English accents. I'm worried. again. actually I'm thinking about my teacher recommendations  which is getting me worried. so I'm worrying myself now. too much of this  is not too good. I knew a girl who used to give herself ulcers,, I'm  wondering if it was psychological?  well,, probably there was some  psychological reason. woow,, I'm so happy I'm taking this course. its soo cool.

NaN,"Rather than sitting at a blank computer screen right now, I am sitting in the hallway outside my dorm room. You see, my roommate Carly is sleeping. She was fortunate to have no classes on friday. I on the other hand, have chemistry on friday mornings at 10. You understand the peril it takes to get out of bed on fridays when she can sleep away, often until long after I return. As is the case today, which is why I am still in the hallway so as to not disturb her sleep. It's not that I need to sleep right now, it's the idea behind it--she sleeping while I am up and writing this paper. This paper by the way is the first of two papers I have been blessed to right today. This writing assignment is fun; it's pretty interesting to see where your mind will go in a matter of a few minutes or seconds. One word or thought will take you in a completely new and most of the time, very different direction. Back to the second paper I'll be writing today. My ethics in nursing class has a paper due next thursday. We meet twice a week, one on tuesdays and once on thursdays. It is quite a walk to the nursing building. It is located at the far end of campus, so much so that often times it is omitted from maps of campus. But, I enjoy the class so the walk is manageable. Ahh, all these pop ups keep coming while I am writing this. I really don't like the idea of pop ups. Back to my paper. We discuss some pretty controversial subjects in the ethics class, all in preparation for the nursing field. It's hard to think of everything that we will one day face. That is, if we actually get accepted into the nursing program. It's pretty tough I believe. They don't accept everyone which leans its way to be a competitive program. I hope I get accepted. It seems to be the direction that God is pointing my towards. I don't now though; I think  I need to have a couple more talks with him to see where He wants me and  where I might serve him best. Well, I'm approaching the end of this writing assignment activity. So without further adew(I don't really know how to    spell that word, but go with me on it) this will end my first writing assignment for psychology. I sure hope I accomplished the task at hand.

I have just finished my final class for the day, so I figured that I would go ahead and get caught up on my homework for my psychology class. I have never taken any kind  of psychology class, so I don't really know what to expect. Hopefully it won't be a hard class because some of my other ones are pretty hard, and I wasn't use to doing a lot of work and studying in high school. I liked high school a lot, and kind of wish that I was still in it. I sort of miss all of my friends and it just isn't the same to party without all of them. I went home for the Labor Day holidays and partied with them, but now that I'm back in Austin everything has changed back again. I haven't really met many people since I've been here, but I can say that there are quite a few weird people. Hopefully I will get use to Austin soon because it hasn't really worked out too well just yet. I've  already received two speeding tickets, a parking ticket, and had my truck towed once since I moved in two weeks ago. My parents aren't too happy with me right  now, so I've got to get good grades to get them off of my back. I keep screwing  up on this computer and don't really know what I'm doing. I never have been too good with computers-even though I have taken several classes in high school. I  can type rather quickly, but that is about all. My fingers are getting tired of typing because I haven't typed all summer. I guess I need to get use to it since I'm going to be doing a lot of it now that I'm in college. I'm not too happy  right now because I have to type this paper in the lobby computer room. I just  brought back with me a notebook computer that my mom gave me, but I can't get the CD-ROM to work. The stupid thing won't read the disks for some reason, so I haven't been able to hook up the UT Connect package that I just bought. I think I made a few people mad when I went to purchase that UT Connect package because  there was a long line and I sort of cut to the front on accident. I was just  trying to ask the person a question about what line to get in, and he thought  that I had already been waiting, and that it was my turn. Even though the guy that I cut in front of looked kinda pissed, I wasn't about to turn around and  get at the back of the line.

NaN,"on this campus that feels that way. well on the other hand, there are math majors, so I guess I'm one of few. Great only 9. 5 minutes to go. I guess the good thing about this assignment is that you can't really run out of things to write about, you just keep typing whatever your thinking, even if tends to weigh on the pointlessness of this assignment, its still something to write about, after all I'm thinking about it aren't I?  I still have not even read my psychology chapter. I wonder if that is even necessary, every other bit of reading I have done in my classes has been a waste. Well not a waste I guess, I am learning something about the material and to discipline myself to do the work. I really miss my best friends back home. They both went to UT campuses at home. Dallas and Arlington. I'm kind of glad to be here at UT Austin since we obviously have the more qualified professors and all, but man I'm just depressed without my friends. I'm not very good at making new ones, it takes me a while to warm up to people. After all, it took me 4 years to become friends with my 2 best friends. Everything else just seemed like an acquaintance compared to them. They really are great. I just wish the felt the same about me, but I'm sure they don't. I'm always the one that over appreciates things. I guess that is why my friendships didn't really mean much, because I made everyone tired of it, I don't know maybe that is just total crap I made up. I tend to justify things too much when I should just let them go. I can't believe I have to sit through 2 sessions of biology tomorrow. If they were going to combine the course, they could at least make it be on different days. But no, they have to make it back to back, well not really back to back there is a 2 hour interim between the 2 classes. At least its time to catch up on my reading that I'll no doubt be behind on in a matter of days at this rate. I'm really enjoying chemistry though. Doctor Laude is awesome. I just hope I do well in his class, I hate liking teachers and then doing poorly in their class. Actually that is never happened to me before, I've always done well in classes that I liked. I don't know why people become teachers if they don't want to help students. Go flip burgers somewhere if you don't care, that way we'd only have teacher that cared and wanted to help us learn and graduate. It seems like all my professors will be like that this year. Except professor Ibragim, he can barely speak english, I don't know how he is going to be over the next semester. So far he is been ok, I guess.

I could do chest, tris, and shoulders on Sunday, Tae Kwon do on Monday, quads and hams on Tuesday, Tae Kwon Do on Wednesday, back and bis on Thursdays, Tae Kwon Do on Fridays, Calves and inner, outer and glutes on Saturday. I like that schedual because my time is not fully committed to one area of interest. I used to work out every day of the week. I also can't do that anymore because my interests in the martial arts prohibit me from emulating Markus Ruhl. The German Giant! That guy is swool. I think that's how you speel swool. As in it's swoolen. Hum, maybe it's swolen. Whatever, who cares? An English teacher ya but on stream of consiousness? Besides, what if my consiousness doesn't want me to spell it right. Maybe my mind is secretly liberal and is telling me to go against the 'establishment'. 'Damn the Man' and 'down with big brother'  and all of that. Maybe it's my secret way of avoiding conformity. That all sounds like bullshit to me but who can say otherwise besides me. I guess everyone now that I've said it's b. s. but that's not the point. The point is, of this tiny fragment of thought anyway, is that I could basically come up withany excuse I wanted to explain my actions and no one could say otherwise. Why can't you go up on the 'stand' and declare yourself that you were insane at the time of the murder. I mean, expertise and all that junk doesn't insure that from one, or maybe even no meeting at all, meeting a psychologist can determine that the accused was insane at the time of the crime. Does it really even make it more likely? Lets say that my mom was killed. I'd be pretty pissed and I'd break things and fight and all that fun stuff but would I classify myself as insane at the time? No, to myself anyway. If it could get me out of trouble ya, but I would know that I was really just pissed off and sad and all like that. But whatever, how can I talk about this? I have no credentials. Which brings up another point, why do you need credentials? Why do people always quote other people in research papers. I'm mostly talking about philosophy papers and diplomatic position papers. Why quote Plato, was he so enormously intellegent that all your oqn thoughts are irrelevent? Why not write a paper about what you think? Maybe you have read some of Plato's writing, then perhaps you should discuss your thoughts on that but why form an opinion entirely off what other people have said? What does that make you?

NaN,"My thoughts, sensations, and emotions are always changing with each new experience, idea, and whatever happens throughout my life. They are affected sometimes by what other people think and sometimes affected from just maturing and thinking differently. Right now I feel like I am in control of myself because I am doing well in school academically, socially, and mentally. School work is very important to me and I make sure that I do well. I don't go overboard like a lot of my friends who study hours every day. Socially, I have adapted very well in meeting new friends. Mentally, I am in control and focused on what is going on in my life. There were some problems that have caused some stress in my life since college started. First, me and my roommate got in some petty arguments, but now we are getting along just fine. Also, I had some guy problems. I regretted doing some things I knew I shouldn't have done, but now we worked things out and or friendship is even better than before. I know that I haven't been eating right and sleeping enough, which is causing some changes in my body that cause me to be more tired and weak. I always go to sleep way too late and wake up early for my classes. Last night a friend called at two in the morning and I talked to him for hours even though I should have y eight-o-clock class. I am in a very good mood today because everything seems to be working out for me. I'm usually a nice pleasant person until I am faced with a lot of stress or go through PMS. Then I get in a really bad mood. My friends know when to stay away from me. The only thing really troubling me right now is all the reading I have to do for my classes. the assignments they give us are no problem, but the reading is crazy. They bombard us with reading assignments that  really aren't necessary. My art class, for instance, requires for the present moment for me to read from pages 13 to 200-something. I really don't want to read about all these statues and paintings and sculptures from different eras. Anyway, I miss my family, but I'm not homesick at all. How can I be when my parents call ALL the time?  I know they care for me, but it's really not necessary for them to want to visit every weekend, which I won't allow them to do. That sounds mean, but they're going to have to get used to it.

Maybe it's just the suppressed anger or whatever that makes me doubt my feelings for him, or maybe I just honestly didn't. But I was obviously feeling something at the time.

It's seemed quite redundant at points, yet interesting overall. I love to write. I have been told that I am a very creative writer. I like that. I like being creative. I think it's interesting to be creative instead of always being precise and conservative. I forgot what I was about to say. I'm glad I can still type with a moderate speed. I would be screwed right now if I were a horrible typist. I am not all that great, but I am fairly quick. I love choosing words to write. I write differently than I speak, though. Sometimes I wish I were able to speak as creatively as I write. I have to admit, though, I do come up with some fun words. Fantabulous. I love that word. Absofuckinglutely. I love that one too. I only say that one on occasion, though. It sounds quite harsh coming from a girl. I try not to cuss a whole lot, but I can't help it sometimes. Like, when I'm around my girlfriends, I tend to cuss a whole lot more than when I'm around guys. I think girls sound trashy when they cuss constantly. I had NEVER said a cuss word in my whole life until I was about fourteen years old! Now, I've gotten a little too comfortable saying them. I even cuss when I'm around my mom, which doesn't make her too happy. She cusses on occasion around me too, though. Wow, I don't know what I'm doing. I met this guy named Cas, and, I think he's a real cutie, but I've also met so many other people in the past weeks, and I like some of them, too.

Sorry, I feel much better. My legs are so sore. I wonder what happens in a person's brain to tell his/her body that he/she needs to use the restroom. This TV next to me is really big, and I would like to turn it on right now, but I have more important things to do, namely writing this assignment. It would preoccupy me. I am really stressed out right now because I have so much going on. It gives me a headache. What causes headaches? Psychology is going to be a really fun course. I type really slowly, and I am trying not to look at the keys, but I am not doing a good job. My teachers are all great, and I lucked out with my math professor. He actually talks English. I wonder who ever thought of pencils and how they work. It is an amazing thing. Girls are wonderful  they make so happy. I have to maintain at least a 3. 5 to stay in the Business Honors Program, but I can do that if I really set my mind to it. Joining a fraternity would be so fun, but they are so expensive. My bed looks really comfortable. I always wonder if what we dream happens in reality later in life. Deja vu is a feeling that I cannot explain. I have always wondered what happens inside the brain when this feeling occurs. I think that I have a slight obsessivecompulsive disorder because I want everything to be so neat and clean. I wonder if other people have this same feeling. I am always scared to talk about it in front of other people because I don't want them to think that I am weird. Who would have ever come up with the idea of the computer out of nowhere? They must have been brilliant. I feel a little lightheaded right now because I put a dip of Skoal Wintergreen Long Cut in my lip. I hope that I can quit soon because I have been dipping since my freshman year in high school. My back is a little sore. I wish that I could go to sleep now, but I have to read some MIS 310 stuff. Psychology is a huge class. It has 540 people in it, and that is 50 more people than in my graduating class at Spring High School last May. Well, it has been 30 minutes.

NaN,"Well, here goes. I'm listening to all of the songs i've fuond over the last few days and am slowly getting tired of them. I'm worried about my typing skills too. I've gotten worse and i can't figure out why. Maybe it's the keyboard, or maybe it's the desk. I doubt it's becuase i'm always in a hurry. Why would that be it? I really like this next song though. I hope my roommate is able to get to the movie tonight because i don't want her to miss it. I'm glad that i found someone to go with though. That would be horrible if i hadn't! I'm getting really frustrated that i can't seem to get this Welcome Package! Really, who locks their doors when they know everyone has to get in!! Maybe i'm just really weak and can't get in. No no. . that's not it. They locked their doors. I'm going to have to ask Sarah to go with me. I also need to call Amy. Grr. i don't want to do that , but it would be rude not to call her. What else? I need to go to the gym, but that's another thing i don't want to do alone and sarah's to lazy to go. I'm really excited that there are going to be 5 fred movies in a row this month! What luck! And a   road   movie!! It just proves that soemtimes dreams really do come true. hahha. well, maybe. I just hope i'm able to go home to see it because it comes on really early in the morning and i don't think my roommate would like me to much if i woke her up to watch a movie. Of course, she is a heavy sleeper, so she might not even notice. Man, my arms are getting tired. i don't why that is. i guess i should relax and just sing along.  i'm singing in the rain!   hmmm. . that's not working to well. I really wish i could go home more often because i do not like what the water is doing to my hair. It looks horrible, but i shouldn't care because i've never cared before. Of course, my hair has never looked to so bad before. I'm really tired too. I want to read something interesting for once. I wish I had my Entertainment Weekly already, but nooo, i have to wait till Sept. 27. That's a long time! I don't know if I can wait that long. I need something! I'm dying over here without a book! I have cable now, but that's no substitute. I am glad that the cable has TCM and Cartoon Network. It's weird how my taste changed this summer. I never thought I would be into the PowerPuff Girls, but I am. i really always thought they're name was PowDerPuff Girls. Oops. It's a cute show though. I can't decide who i like the most. It's just one of those shows where",stream of consciousness,0,1,496,8.7,8.67,85.28,18.35,12.5,0,12.5,0,2.22,4.84,0,4.03,11.29,0.81,5.04,2.62,0.81,0.4,2.42,0.2,0.4,0.4,10.89,1.81,1.81,5.65,0.4,4.23,1.21,2.42,1.41,0.81,0,5.04,1.01,2.62,0.4,0,0.6,4.64,2.22,19.15,1.21,2.02,0.81,0,5.44,5.04,1.81,1.41,0.81,0.6,0.4,3.02,0.81,0.2,1.01,1.01,0,0.2,0,0.2,2.22,1.41,0,0.2,1.21,0.4,0,0.2,0.81,23.19,9.27,3.02,0,0,0.4,2.42,0,0,8.06,0,0,0

NaN,"this is my first writing assignment. I'm watching cosby on tv. I have a headache. I've had a headache most of today. I woke up and was still dead tired even after 8 hours of sleep. I had a stomach ache and felt like I was going to be sick. I had a headache and didn't feel like doing anything. so I got back in bed for a little bit. then went over to the san jac food place for some oj. that worked out pretty good I think for breakfast. I think from now on on mwf I'll just go to san jac for some oj and walk to calculus. that class is going pretty good. I was supposed to have a study group tonight but I called everyone and nobody could go. so that was kinda stupid since even the girl who set it up couldn't make it. but I don't really need it. I think I'll be doing more teaching than learning in that study group. I had calculus in high school but got a 3 on the AP test so I'll take calculus over again and learn the stuff better since I'm an ee major and will really need to know the stuff. I was thinking about switching majors to psych cause I really enjoyed everything I learned in high school when I took it. I don't know if I'll switch over though yet. I'm liking me ee302 and 306 classes so we'll just see where the year goes. all day I've felt like crap and I miss my best friend mariko so much. especially today since I've felt bad. she always makes me feel better. it's really tough being here at college 2 1/2 hours away from her and only being able to see her every couple of weeks. I'd come home every weekend if I had my car up here but my mom didn't let me bring my car up this year. I'd pay for the parking permit and everything but she said it's not part of the college experience. I don't care about the experience. I'm here to learn and I do that during the week. I do all my homework when I need to during the week and then nothing on the weekends. so why can't I come home and spend my time with the one person I want to spend time with. well I know people here that have offered me rides so I can get a ride home every couple weeks to see mariko. my mom was mad this past weekend cause I spent most of my time with mariko. and my mom said she didn't bring me home just to hang out with her. well from now on I'll get rides home from other people so I can spend my time with who I want since my mom won't be wasting her time driving and getting me. I feel bad for thinking that, but that's just how I feel.

Calculus is the weirdest because I don't remeber much at all clearly from high school yet I kinda like bein confused like that. I wonder how all of my friends are doing form high school?  I hear that the football team is using more of a passing game and I wish I was there for it all. I need to call my friend Jonathan, I can't wait to go visit him at Texas A&M. I've been writing for fie minutes now, its going to be a while. I need to go get I computer, I am tred of always waiting in line or bumming other peoples'. I'm gettin pretty good at spinning the pen on my finger, its kinda embarrassing if I do it in class and I miss. I wonder if my dad is going to get the new car or not. I would loe the chance to drive it. I would race cars if I could but I would be entering the field kinda late and I don't even know where to start. I wish I hd the time and money to take driing lessons this summer, then I could at least go to driev on a track if I had the car. Theer are too many things I want to do when I grow up. I like to be able to do everything, but I also want to marry the perfect girl and have the best kids and spend all of my time with them. I'e been writing for ten minutes now, I'm getting closer. My hand is starting to get kinda tired, I have multiple thoughts at the same time and I can't keep up with them all at the same time for this paper. I need to do my laundry, htose sheets I hae are still kinda stiff. I wish I had'nt slept so late today, I wasted half of my day and I missed a class too, it was probably the only time the teacher has gien a pop quiz.

NaN,"about whether or not I fear women overall. Well, I sure like to talk and think about them a lot. My mom was always such a hard ass on me growing up. I know she loved me a lot, although I hate to admit it, and I guess that's why she was. Or, maybe it was because of her upbringing. Anyway, nonetheless, I've been afraid of her forever and I'm ashamed because I think it fucks up my deal with other women and I really have a hard time deciding if I love her or not. I know it's my """"""""duty"""""""" or whatever that means, but do I really? Of course I do on some level, but, man, I always get all tearyeyed when I even start thinking about it. That's another thing: I haven't been able to cry in a good, long while. Oh well, c'est la vie. My friend Elizabeth comes to mind now. I wonder how she's doing up there in NY. We have a really weird relationship, and it really hurt when I learned that she liked Matt for a long time. Guess I always had a little something for her. That was a great time up at the Doubletree last Christmas, though, I will say. Mr. A footing the entire bill, too. I guess Townes Van Zandt does have it right when he said, """"""""We all got holes to fill, and them holes are all that's real. """""""" Last night, I learned about some of Manny's holes concerning his father. He sure has been acting differently lately, though. It must be tough, but I don't know how to handle it. Maybe it's just best to let him be for a while. I kind of liked that Emily girl I met last night as well. I guess that statistic that says that men think about sex/women every 30 sec or so is right; the majority of this writing's about them. Or, maybe I just have some complex or something. Probably a combo of the two. I don't know what to think about God these days. I sure have been praying a lot to Him lately, though, over this Sue pregnancy thing. God, I hope that works out for me. I know it's selfish, but, man, You've got to understand. I truly am sorry, and I'll never have sex with another girl again on a onenighter. Lord, hear my prayer. Amen. Our society's kind of funny these days. If there is a man upstairs, I hope he's having a good time. It's amazing how fucked up stuff can get down here, though. After high school, I mean. Sometimes it's hard to be a man, and a woman I'm sure. I wonder who's got it worse. """"""""Sucede que me canso de ser hombre. """""""" It just so happens I'm tired of being a man, says Octavio Paz.

NaN,"""""""I am sitting here in the dorm computer lab just thinking about how I haven't gotten my computer in the mail and wondering if I will ever get it. Maybe I just wasted a thousand dollars. For some reason, I just became very nervous. I think it might be because I am actively trying not to mess up in my typing. I worry a lot. Why do I worry a lot?  I am worrying about this weekend. I kissed a guy for the very first time. I am eighteen years old and this is the first experience I have ever really had regarding those kinds of emotions. Lately, that is all I can think about. I feel guilty for some reason. I feel like I should have waited for a more special moment. He was the only guy who ever said I was beautiful and we became instant friends. So, he taught me how to kiss. It really wasn't romantic. Maybe that is why I feel like I wasted my first real kiss, because it wasn't in a romantic manner. I just really would like to forget about it. I hope that I do. But, there is another side of me that is glad I did it. I have been in quite a panic because I thought I was the most inexperienced eighteen year old girl. Now, at least I have kissed a guy. I am going home this weekend to my comfort zone. I will probably tell all of my friends about my experience. I know that they will be so excited just because I seem to actually be growing up now that I am away. It smells good. It is probably dinner. I am really hungry. But I am hungry for something spectacular. I haven't eaten anything really good since I came here, not even chocolate. When I go home, I am going to eat spaghetti. Yuuummm!  That is my favorite meal. I will also eat a big piece of chocolate. I can not wait to see my little dog. I love her so much. She really is my best friend. The only thing that saddens me is that she has gotten passed the fact that I am gone. She follows my older brother now. I am glad that she isn't sad anymore, but part of me feels like she doesn't consider me her mother"""""""" anymore. I'll just have to get over it. I would rather have her happy than depressed. Sometimes I think I am depressed. My mother went through a depression after my father passed away. My brother just called me and interrupted me. I told him to call me in 5 minutes. Now it is very difficult to continue. I can't go back to the thoughts I was having before. My back is hurting. It could be because I am overweight and have large boobs. I hope everyone else is revealing as much as I am. What if I'm the only person who talks about embarrassing thoughts.

Whoa, a crazy thing that came across my mind yesterday was this thought (I was actually thinking about it yesterday in psychology class): """"""""They say that color is the result of light being absorbed or reflected off of an object. So in order to see color, there has to be light, right?  If that is true, then is it true whenever you go into a pitch black room, everything is actually without color?! I know that everything wouldn't be in black and white, but wouldn't everything be in black at least?! Everyone would be of the same color in a dark room? It's pretty mind baffling to me. """""""" Also, I've heard that whenever you dream, you don't really dream in color, but your mind and memory make up the colors. They are not true colors. Who really knows anyways? The zipper of my Dior makeup bag is dipping into the cap of my orange juice bottle that I had this morning. Last night was all fun and games until I got home and realized how unsure I am of everything right now, and it's really not a good feeling. I guess I'm just getting used to this whole thing, just transitioning. Jess forgot to get milk last night, so I had dry cereal this morning.

NaN,"I am a little irritated right now. I just did this thing for about 5 minutes and then my computer just like shut off!  I cannot believe I just spent those five minutes only to just have it all erased. Things like that irritate me a lot. I always just hate having done something and then it being useless. I guess that could be kind of an insecurity but yeah. I am not going to psychoanalyze myself. I guess since this is one of thise things that could do that for me. I wonder if this will get picked to be read. Probably not. Its getting done way early. I can't really see the reasoning behind the whole stream of consciousness thing. I mean yeah you can track your thoughts but couldn't you do that just by paying attention to yourself?  I dunno. just one of those things I guess. Moving on then. I'm eating a rice krispeys treat thing. I get hungry when I am irritated. I have to wonder how evolution made us that way. What is the point of eating when you are irritated. Shouldn't you want to do stuff?  that would make sense in the whole flight or fight mode sense kind of way. I am glad i have an apartment it doesn't smell here and the neighbors are really nice. Of course  you don't make a forced acquaintance like you would if you lived in a dorm I guess but this is more private and I can work on the bills and homework alone. Maybe I'll go out tonight with one of my new friends. I don't have plans and I'm not really interested in going to the game, as if I had the money to go anyways. Money is going to become an issue later. I should try and get a job this semester but i just don't want to get burnt out on my first semester. I don't really need the money but it would be nice in case of an emergency. And who doesn't like a little extra spending money?  I don't know i need to find somewhere close to work but i don't want to have to work as a cashier again. I hated doing that. Not as much as working as an area host(janitor) at a certain theme park. Not at all fond memories of the sausage shack and the bathrooms accompanying it around high noon. Its stupid how people have no real common sense when they go out to have fun. Honestly, who doesn't realize that a urinal is not made to be pooped in. It would hate to know the person who didn't understand what a urinal . URINal, is for its use is right there in the name c'mon people!  But yeah my lips are chapped really bad.

NaN,"So far I have been at UT for I guess 6 school days, and I can already feel myself slipping. School was so much simpler in middle and elementary school. Why can't I go back?  LetÔøΩs see. what did I do today?  I woke up around 2 (we have lives around here), and  was bugging my sister to take me to church. I haven't been there since I don't know how long, but I need to start going again. my ex-boyfriend called and I don't know how it made me feel. I want to be free of him and not have to deal with any of his problems. I don't want to desert him, but I don't know what he wants from me and what I can possibly do for him. it wasn't a really serious relationship and to tell the truth I have no idea what I was thinking when I went out with him. he's not my type at all and my parents would be so disappointed if they found out. thank goodness it's over already. I don't know how I feel about him. I would like to be his friend, but that's it, and I also don't know what he wants. isn't this depressing?  Guys. Don't they all suck?  I wrote my would-have-been-boyfriend in high school and for some silly reason I am still waiting for him to reply. I don't know what's wrong with me. Maybe things will work out in the next ten years or so. I get really tired and depressed when I think about my ex and I don't know what to do about it. I want to be his friend, but I know he wants more and I don't think I can offer him that. I need to ask him what he wants or rather expects from me. He comes from a broken home and has a LOT of problems that I don't want to deal with. He's from Port Arthur and asked me to come down for his birthday. Funny I was actually considering it. what's wrong with me?  I called my little sister (12 yrs. old) and she wasn't home. Neither were my parents. I think they are at my aunt's house eating as usual. they live in new orleans and I miss them a lot. I need to come back and visit and I don't think I can do that until Christmas vacation. that sounds a lot better than Christmas  break. It really bothers me that I didn't capitalize most of the words that should be capitalize, but I shouldn't be worried about that right?  I am so unenergized right now. I need to go jogging or something, but it is late. I can't believe Princess Diana died. Mother Teresa also died, yet she didn't get as much attention as Princess Di. So much has happened in my short 17 years life span.

NaN,"Hi, when I think of this type of writing I think of a project that my little sister did once. she is very interested in psycology and writing. for a class she had to do this and I thought it was very strange. right now I am watching the cowboys game. they suck. i love football, but the cowboys have lost all respect as a team because of the actions of their players. Troy Aikman is kind of cute and Emmit Smith is a really nice guy but all the others don't really impress, it is half time right now. My boyfriend plays football for St. marks. I love him because he is my best friend and he is so sweet to me. My friends keep giving me crap because we talk to each other all the time, but I can't imagine not talking to him. Last night at the Pike BBQ thing, Jerry Jeff Walker played and that was cool, except that I had cramps and felt bad and Wes had not called so I was mifted. I knew that he was having fun wiht the boys, but I still wanted to hear from him, I am not sure that I am doing this assignment correctly because it is hard to just write what comes to mind, you know. I fell like I am typing this to someone who is going to read it and so I don't know what to put. I am so tired right now. I went to church this morining with a friend of mine who made me go. (I told her to make me go)  The pastor talked about dying and how our spiritual goal in life is to die. I had issues with that; I don't think I was as openminded as I could have been because I was tired and hungry and grumpy and I had not talked to WEs this morning. My roommates phone is ringing,  I like my roommate a lot , but when he phones ring all night it can be annoying,  We are having fun together though she likes to party a little more than I do. That's okay. I am not that big of a party girl and I think that my friends think I am a party pooper. Oh well, I did not party hard in high school so why start now. I know how to have fun, but I came here to get an education, so studying an dmaking my grades is the most important. my best friend kathleen went to Harvard and she has not called me or talked to me yet. I like her but sometimes she can be very difficult to talk to I think that she was very jealous of my relationship wiht Wes. I am tired adn bored oh well  There are some very ood commercials on the television. I know we weren't supposed to correct our typing, but I am a perfectionist.
