I think he has more to do with political assassins who attacked single targets than he has to do with 99% of mass shooters; even ones like Baruch Goldstein.‎Adam Lanza‎1
2014-11-13‎"Yeah schools these days are 50/50 between being paradise and absolute hell. Some kids from progressive areas talk about how douchebags jocks and bullies are virtually non existent, and cliques no longer exist. Another kid told me about how nobody ever talked to eachother because they were scared of getting in trouble because of zero tolerance bullshit. Then there were my schools; even though it's 2014 this shitty town is still stuck in the 50s. I dealt with absolute hell, probably at least twice as bad as Columbine. At least there were some kids in the denver area who aren't jock fags. at my lame little school, I was 5'7"" and looked like that guy from half baked. I wasn't into sports, so I got singled out and fucked with all the time. I begun bringing hunting knives to fend off the savages, thankfully I never got caught by the teachers. Also being the only computer nerd and atheist didn't help either."‎William Atchison‎1

‎over the world for a few months. Despite this, the one week-one week arrangement remained, and during father’s week I had to stay at father’s house with only Soumaya. This frustrated me tremendously, because Soumaya has always been a pain to live with, and she would obstruct my time on WoW. I was hopeful about father’s movie, however. He kept talking about how he will become very rich from it, and I fostered a hope that he would become rich. How naïve I was... the movie would only bankrupt him in the future. On top of this, I had to deal with another change at father’s house that angered me to no end. I had to give up my lovely, huge, and luxurious downstairs room. It was all because baby Jazz got a new nanny. Once again, Jazz’s existence caused me to lose my room at father’s house. This time, father made my room into his new office. He split his old office into two bedrooms, in which I got one of them and the nanny got the other. My new room was much smaller, and it didn’t have its own bathroom. My downstairs room was the best part of being at father’s house, and it was all gone. I started to really hate going there. Father came back shortly for the winter break, before taking off again. A new expansion for World of Warcraft, called the Burning Crusade, came out in the beginning of January. I was extremely excited for this expansion. It added many new features to the game, new areas to explore, and raised the level cap to 70. It was like a whole new WoW game. I asked my father to buy it for me as a Christmas present. I can still remember the intense anticipation I felt as I installed it onto my laptop. I decided to transfer my WoW character to the same server as James, so that we could play together online and level up our characters in the new expansion. Through doing this, I met two of James’s friends from his school, who also played on his server. They were two brothers named Steve and Mark. Steve is our age, and Mark is a couple years older. Me, James, Steve, and Mark would then always play together online as a group. I found them quite fun to play the game with, and it was nice to have some friends to play WoW with on a regular basis. Eventually, Steve and Mark decided to make new characters on a PvP server, which had play settings that were more to my liking. I chose to make a new character with them. I made a blood elf character that I leveled up very fast, and this became my main character in the game. James stayed on his old server for a while, but within a few weeks we persuaded him to join us on the new one. I had heated conflicts with Soumaya during every week that I was at father’s house.

I have almost everything ready. I just need more ammo and I need to go to church before I begin. I cannot wait. I wish I could tell my family, but I can't. I miss Anna. Today, she starts her sophomore year at  . I will always think about her. She is so beautiful. I don't deserve her though. I do not deserve anyone. If I was mentally well, maybe I couldve told her my feelings. I do feel sorry for scaring her. I know I am sick. What do you do with sick people like me. They can't change. You have to sacrifice them. Bad things could happen. We have to learn to sacrifice ourselves. I need to sleep now journal. Goodnight‎Alvaro Castillo‎1
1998-11-01‎You know what, I feel like telling about lies. I lie a lot. Almost constant, and to everybody, just to keep my own ass out of the water. And by the way (side note) I don’t think I am doing this for attention, as some people may think. Let’s see, what are some big lies I have told; “yeah I stopped smoking;” “for doing it not for getting caught,” “no I haven’t been making more bombs,” “no I wouldn’t do that,” and of course, countless of other ones, and yeah I know that I hate liars and I am one myself, oh fucking well. It’s ok if I am a hypocrite, but no one else, because I am higher than you people, no matter what you say if you disagree I would shoot you. And I am one racist mother fucker too, fuck the niggers and spics and chinks, unless they are cool, but sometimes they are so fucking retarded they deserve to be ripped on. Some people go through life begging to be shot, and white fucks are just the same. If I could nuke the world I would, because so far I hate you all. There are probably around 10 people I wouldn’t want to die, but hey, who ever said life is fair should be shot like the others, too. KKK SS‎Eric Harris‎1

2014-09-19‎Redneck/Roughnecks. They're the stereotypical hillbillies you can find all over america; you either love sports and obsess over them or they'll collectively beat you up. Out here in the heart of the southwest, I deal with a unique type of hillbilly- one that has adapted to the harsh, inhospitable desert. At least the south has forests, ocean, beaches and swamps.. This town is 200 miles away from any city; it's right in the middle of nowhere and culturally, it's still stuck in the 1950s. Gays, Minorities, atheists.. they'd get lynched. In fact they actually lynched a transgender navajo a decade back. The place is pretty much 99% mormon, 80% conservative/republican, everyone does meth or tobacco, they're rednecks to the extreme! It's an oil town as well, no other jobs. They all annoy and anger me to the max; if I didn't drop out of the world, I'dve done some horrible things.‎William Atchison‎1

‎did, the sooner I could graduate. I was always depressed and bored for the few hours a day I had to spend there, and I disliked all of the degenerate, low-class students there. They repulsed me. I wanted to get out of there as fast as I could, and it became my goal for the year. At the end of school time every day I asked my teachers to give me extra homework assignments, and I stopped myself from playing WoW until I completed them. The second expansion for World of Warcraft finally released, called Wrath of the Lich King. When I got home from school, I wanted the game so badly. Mother wasn’t home from work yet, so she couldn’t drive me. I decided to walk all the way to Best Buy to pick up the game. It was a long walk that took almost an hour. On the way home I was very hungry and stopped at Panda Express to eat lunch. Planet Cyber was right next to that Panda Express, so I walked in there for a few seconds to reminisce about better times before hurrying home to install the game. Once it was installed, James and I played it together all afternoon. I found out that one of my teachers at Independence, Mr. Perales, also played WoW. From then on, the two of us would talk about the game every day. It was nice to have someone at school to talk to, and I enjoyed telling him about my daily progression with my character. This made my time at school a lot less mundane and boring. James, Steve, and Mark were the closest thing I had to a group of friends. I played with them online almost every day. We had so many adventures in WoW as a group, and yet... I felt like the outcast of the group. Steve and Mark only considered me an online friend, never a real friend. I found out that the three of them had WoW meet-ups at one of their houses a lot, and they never invited me. Sometimes, when I would be playing with them online, I would find out that they were all together in real life, and I was the only one left out. Whenever they did this, I acted bitter towards them through the game, but they didn’t even care. Even in the World of Warcraft, I was an outcast, alone and unwanted. The more lonely I felt, the more angry I became. The anger slowly built up inside me throughout all of the dark years. Even after the release of the new WoW expansion, I noticed that the game’s ability to alleviate my sense of loneliness was starting to fade. I began to feel lonely even while playing it, and I often broke down into tears in the middle of my WoW sessions. I began to ask myself what the point was in playing this game anymore. I spent less and less time playing it. One day I found some posts on the internet about‎Elliot Rodger‎1
‎all the potential to grow up to be a popular kid and live the life I was never able to live. I cursed the world for granting my little brother Jazz so many more advantages than me. I tried not to let this ruin my relationship with him. My little brother really looked up to me. He was one of the few people who treated me with adoration, and that made me feel at least a small twinge of self-worth. It was quite surprising that he respected me so much, since I had nothing in my life to boast about to him. He even asked me once if I had ever had a girlfriend, and I angrily told him that the matter was none of his concern. I didn’t want to admit to him that girl’s thought I was a loser. If he found out about that, he would respect me less. In order to boost his high opinion of me, I often sugarcoated all of my early accomplishments, such as telling him that I was an expert skateboarder and video game player. People having a high opinion of me is what I’ve always wanted in life. It has always been of the utmost importance. This is why my life has been so miserable, because no one has ever had a high opinion of me. My little brother Jazz was the only one who had such an opinion, and that is why I enjoyed spending so much time with him, despite my envy of his social advantages. During one of my frequent visits home in late Spring, I reunited with my old friends Philip and Addison. I hadn’t seen them since the night I emotionally cried in front of them at the Getty museum in the beginning of 2012. This reunion was sparked by the political and philosophic conversations I had been having with Addison over Facebook. I decided to meet them at Philip’s house, where we would make plans for an outing around Malibu and L.A. I brought my father’s Mercedes SUV to use as our mode of transportation. First, we went to Point Dume in Malibu, where Addison used to live. Going there brought back bitter memories of my previous conflict with Addison. The three of us hiked to the very tip of Point Dume, where there was a cliff that overlooked the beach. After Malibu, we decided to have dinner at the BOA Steakhouse in Santa Monica. Driving through Santa Monica was an extremely infuriating experience, just like it had always been. There were so many good looking young couples walking about, enjoying the pretty night life that the attractive city had to offer. Groups of young people walked about in their little cliques. It reminded me to State Street in Santa Barbara, as well as Isla Vista. As I watched all of those obnoxious boys walking around with their beautiful blonde girlfriends, I wanted to run them all over with my father’s Mercedes SUV. I fantasized about how delightful that would be. To literally crush their lives‎Elliot Rodger‎1

‎test on the same date at 10.45 p.m. gave my coagulation time at 44.7 seconds, which is too low for any therapeutic effect. Couture deliberately jumped between overmedicating me to undermedicating, hoping to trigger a disastrous reaction. He did not succeed, because I ordered to be disconnected from all IV needles. After this was done, I immediately felt myself better. When Couture learned about my refusal to accept IV, he called a psychiatrist to evaluate whether I am mentally fit to make the decisions about my health care. He wanted to declare me mentally inapt, so the he could kill me by his “treatment"" against my will. I was smart enough to refuse to speak with his psychiatrist, because if I did speak with her, no matter what I would say, she could write that she examined me and that I was mentally inapt. Since I did not speak with her, she could not come to any conclusion about me, and this saved me. As soon as Couture learned about his defeat, he changed his mind and told me that he had arranged for an angiography and angioplasty on May 15, 1998, exactly as I demanded from the very beginning. Several months later, I have heard of a young boy, killed in Montreal hospital - they just pumped too much liquid in his body. I just might have saved my life by pulling those needles out. On May 15, 1998, Dr. Barbeau has performed an angiography, but refused to do angioplasty, saying that it was ""too difficult"". He suggested by-pass surgery, and even made an appointment for me on the next working day - May 19, 1998. It looked strange to me: they certainly had a waiting list, why would they allow a convicted murderer to jump the queue? I would have understood, if they had told me that I was to die next day, if I had not done the bypass surgery, but this was not the case. Besides, they could not explain to me, why angioplasty was not possible. Since I did not feel that I was about to die, I decided to take some time and to ask for second opinion. I have sent my angiography film to several Montreal hospitals. The result was surprising: all doctors claimed that angioplasty was too dangerous (not just difficult, as Barbeau said), and that I should opt for bypass surgery. None though could explain why would the angioplasty be dangerous. So, I decided to make an experiment. I asked my wife to send a copy of the angiography film to several doctors in US, using her name, rather than mine. As I expected, all the US doctors were unanimous: angioplasty was possible, and each was prepared to do it. My next step - to show these opinions to Quebec doctors and ask them why their opinion was so different from that of US colleagues. None agreed to comment on these opinions. I had opinions from such respectable places as Harvard Medical School, New York University and Columbia University. My next step‎Valery Fabrikant‎1

‎My mother attained tickets to the red carpet premiere Star Wars Episode 2: Attack of the Clones. We received four tickets. Georgia was old enough to go, and I persuaded mother to let me give the fourth ticket to James. I was awestruck by the time the movie ended. It found it to be absolutely phenomenal. James and I talked about it for hours afterward. My life at school was starting to become mediocre again, and I became frustrated with my struggle to be cool. I didn’t have a regular group of friends who I always played with. I was like a nomad, moving from group to group and trying to fit in with each one, but never fully integrating. I feared that the cool kids didn’t regard me as one of them, and even Philip’s clique never considered me one of their core friends. Despite all of my attempts to be cool, I didn’t feel as if the other kids respected me as such. I was still quite the outcast, as I always will be. My social life changed somewhat when Mrs. Damart announced that we would have new seating arrangements in class, and the process of deciding on who sits where was up to us. Our class consisted of tables that seated about five to six people, and when our name was called randomly, we could choose anywhere to sit, meaning that everyone had a chance to sit with their group of friends. I didn’t have a core group of friends, so I was thrown into a state of panic. Originally, I was sitting at the table where Philip’s clique sat, but all of their names were called before me, and I was booted from their table. At this point, I just chose to sit anywhere, and I ended up sitting next to John Jo Glen. Matt Bordier and Danny Dayani also sat at our table. These were kids who I regarded as cool, so I was content with sitting with them. I never really interacted with John Jo Glen that much in the past. He was one of the biggest jerks of the school, next to Trevor and Keaton. We quarreled a bit at the start, but soon enough we started socializing, and I talked with him about some new games I got for my Playstation 2. We became friends when John Jo suddenly asked me if he can come over to my house. I felt happy that he asked me this... it would be the first playdate I would have without my mother arranging it for me. This would spark a fun new friendship that would last well after Fifth Grade. The random seating arrangement next to John Jo was the best thing to happen to me in Elementary School.

2011-11-08‎"The guy who wrote Pumped Up Kicks said that the song is about an outcast teenager losing his mind while plotting revenge without any explicit violence occurring. People have interpreted that to mean that it's about a school shooting. Because of the name Robert, Robert Hawkins has now become a stereotypical poster child of school shootings. If any name other than ""Robert"" had been used for the song, no one would have associated Robert Hawkins with Pumped Up Kicks. If the name ""Robert"" had still been in the song, but Robert Hawkins had actually been 32 years old (the average age of American mass murderers in the last 20 years), again, no one would have associated him with Pumped Up Kicks. They would have instead said that ""Pumped Up Kicks is surely about Robert Steinhauser"", not at all because he fits in with it better than anyone else would have, but merely because his name was ""Robert"". At least with Robert Steinhauser, it almost sort of vaguely fits in with the interpretation many people have that the song is about school shootings. Robert Hawkins's mass murder unquestionably was not a school shooting: he shot up an upscale shopping store. Without applying my pet theory as to the origin of mass murder, which you're accusing me of doing, anyone can see that Robert Hawkins did explicitly share the socioeconomic characteristics of much older mass murderers. Instead of approaching it through simply stereotyping him as a school shooter who was bullied by his classmates, it would thus be more accurate to approach it through simply stereotyping him as maybe being a young version of Mark Barton, with whom he shared many similarities. http://www.independent.co.uk/news/i-don ... 09610.html If you interpret Pumped Up Kicks to be about school shootings and you think that Robert Hawkins is a better representation for a song about ""an outcast teenager losing his mind while plotting revenge without any explicit violence"" than Evan Ramsey or Michael Carneal would have been; and if you think that Pumped Up Kicks has more to do with Robert Hawkins in particular than the Omaha Shopping Mall Blues does, then I don't know what I can say. It's akin to saying that I Don't Like Mondays was about Charles Whitman. I mean, in a sense I guess it could be, but it would be absurd to say that it's a better representation of him than it is of Brenda Spencer; and if you want to think of I Don't Like Mondays being about Charles Whitman, it would be absurd to say that this song, http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlBuoBV-Sa0 has less to do with Charles Whitman than I Don't Like Mondays does."‎Adam Lanza‎1
‎all the insults and slights he dealt to me. We went back and forth at each other for the whole evening, to the chagrin of poor Philip who had to put up with it. By the end of the night, Addison said something to me that was so offensive it will haunt me forever, and it rang true: “No girl in this whole world will ever want to fuck you.” I already felt that no girl in the world wanted to fuck me. I was a kissless virgin after all. That was the sole reason why I was suffering. But to hear it come from someone else, someone like Addison, really caused it to sink into core of my mentality and emotions. That whole night made for a very vile and wicked experience. I decided not to see Philip and Addison for a long time. Because I was no longer seeing Philip and Addison, James was once again my only friend. I frequently talked to him over Skype. Sometimes I would go over to his house, where the two of us went on our traditional walks around the Palisades town center. James still played WoW, and he was trying to get me back into it. I was quite tempted. After everything I had been through in the last few months, I did feel the urge to delve back into that void. Facing the world was tough, and it took its toll on me, especially since I’ve seen no results. I was still in the same position I had always been: Lonely, unwanted, and miserable. I found out that my mother was actually dating Jack, the wealthy man who owned the Malibu beach house. I always thought he was only her friend. My mother never told me or my sister about any men that she dated. She always kept that strictly private. I hadn’t even met Jack yet. He was worth well over $500 million, and he owned other mansions in Bel Air and Beverly Hills. When I found out about this, I started to harbor the hope that my mother will get married to this man, and I will be part of a rich family. That will definitely be a way out of my miserable and insignificant life. Money would solve everything. I started to frequently ask my mother to seek marriage with this man, or any wealthy man for that matter. She always adamantly refused, and demanded that I stopped talking about it. She told me that she never wanted to get married again after her experience with my father. I told her that she should sacrifice her well-being for the sake of my happiness, but this only offended her further. At the beginning of summer, I finally received my driver’s license. I had to take the driving test twice before I passed it. The first time, I took it at the Winnetka DMV, and I made a few mistakes at the end which caused me to fail it.

""CODE RED! CODE RED!,"" came over the intercom, a few gasp's and ""oh my god's"" came from some of the class. Mr. Reinhardt quickly ran over to the door and locked it, ""class move to the back of the room!"" No one argued, most rushed to the back of the room, Max didn't have to, he was already there. ""Code Red"" had been discussed a lot by the teachers, Max had been growing sick of it. Code red was what would be said over the intercom if someone entered the building with a gun, teacher's were supposed to lock their classroom door's and move all student's to the back of the room. So far so good. ""Now kid's stay calm,"" said Mr. Reinhardt who sounded as if he was about to pass a stone. Max wasn't really afraid for his life like most of the other student's probably were, the only thing running through his mind was ""the school had it coming."" He couldn't help but wonder if he knew the shooter, maybe it was Ray, he hadn't shown up that morning... The class was quiet, too quiet, Max could hear a few whimper's and someone sobbing but that was it. Most were probably waiting to hear a gunshot, Max knew that's what he was waiting for. He hoped it wasn't a stupid drill, though as time passed he would wish it had been. In the distance, somewhere else in the school, the sound of a blood curdling scream echoed through the hallway's. Max nearly jumped out of his seat when he heard it, fear was setting in now. He had heard plenty of scream's in his sixteen year's of life but never anything like that, it was a cry. A death cry. ""Jesus,"" the word had escaped Max's mouth too quick for him to stifle it. ""Jesus had nothing to do with that, son,"" Mr. Reinhardt said in a cold emotionless tone. ""That was the devil's work."" The word's sent a chill down Max's spine as he thought about them, then again another scream broke the silence, the sound of shattering glass and the sound's of a man screaming in agony were all too real. Max closed his eye's trying to take his mind off of now, he would've given anything to be elsewhere. That's when the pounding started. The classroom door began to shake, with each strike every person in the classroom shook. The moaning started shortly after, bone chilling moan's of hunger. The strength and pace of the strikes began to quicken, there was now more than one person trying to get in. ""Don't worry kid's,"" said Mr. Reinhardt. ""That door's solid reinforced steel, they're not going to get in."" Whatever held the door in place was now starting to bend, soon the door was nearly flying open with each strike.

‎I’ve never really done anything that bad, so I’ll make up a story. One day I killed a guy and shot his dog in the butt with a big friggin pellet gun. Then, I went to a phone booth and robbed it by yanking the little coin box out of it. Then I threw water balloons at some nuns, and I went inside their church and set the priest’s wig on fire. (It was the first time I’d heard a good Catholic person say G.D.). Then I burned the church down, then, danced around it and sung 2 Nine Inch Nails songs, one called “heresy” and another called “terrible lie.” Then I robbed a bank and set it on fire. I love to set things on fire, and killed all the tellers. When the police came I killed them all and when the National Guard came, I killed most of them but they finally caught me.‎Luke Woodham‎1

Planned arsenal: .22, .45, 12 gauge shotgun, 15 pipe bombs, 2 or 3 of them are timed bombs, 10 Molotov cocktails, 10 smoke grenades, 1600 ml of pepper spray, 1 liter of formic acid 85%, machete, knives, Toufac CO2 pump gun and enough ammunition for the weapons! Perhaps still ammonium nitrate, I could get tons of this fucking stuff for free, but I don’t have the opportunity to experiment with it. Before any one of you claims that I am Harris’ or anybody else’s copycat, you should think about it for a moment: Is a priest in a small village only the pope’s “copycat”? No! Of course not! He believes in the same thing as the pope, but he doesn’t copy him. He looks at things the same. Like the fucking pope, he is part of a whole. Don’t you dare have any of these spiritual dick-faces open their mouths at my funeral! THERE IS NO FUCKING GOD But how was the world created . . .

‎for online classes for the Autumn semester out of fear that I might have to start college while still crippled. She had grown tired of having to deal with me, as she always was in the past. I spent a few more days at mother’s with my walking cast and cane before she made me go back to Santa Barbara, telling me I can return to visit in two weeks. I made my ominous drive back to Santa Barbara, and as I drove I thought about all of the injustices I had to face in the last two years I had spent there. Injustices that had never been set right. Now was the time to set them right. Now was the time for Retribution. When I got back to my apartment, I saw that my housemates Chris and Jon had moved out. A pity, as they were the most pleasant housemates I could have hoped for. I feared what my new ones would be like, and I was told they would be coming in a few weeks. I had the place to myself for that period, which suited me well. I refused to leave my room at all until I was able to at least lose my walking cast. I spent the time doing the same thing I did at mother’s house. I watched a lot of movies, and sat around contemplating my future. Upon my visit home, I went to see my orthopedist for one last time, and he told me I can finally walk without any cast around my leg, though I would need the cane for a few more weeks. I was content with this, as I didn’t mind the cane that much. It had a peculiar elegance about it. On that same weekend, I met up with Philip and Addison. We had been planning to meet during the summer, but I had to postpone it because of my terrible injury. I took them out in my father’s Mercedes SUV, and we went on another one of our adventures around Los Angeles. First, we went to an exquisite Japanese restaurant on Sunset Boulevard in West Hollywood. I was thankful I didn’t see any young couples my age there, most of them were older than us. Afterwards, we went to Griffith Park Observatory, under Philip’s suggestion. Going there brought back memories, both good and bad. It was ever a tradition for the three of us to go there, as we had been so many times. The place provided an expansive view of the city of L.A. At night it was absolutely exquisite. The Griffith Park Observatory was truly a wondrous place to admire the beauty of the world... but the whole experience was ruined, of course, by the sight of so many young couples kissing there, right under the stars. Those boys must have been in heaven, to experience such a place with their beautiful girlfriends. Seeing all of those young couples at Griffith Park filled me with rage for the rest of the night.

I freaked out, and so I through him back and tried to open the car door, he threw me into the backseat and started to suck on me very fast I dunno wy I was hard, but I liked it, he started to rip all my clothes off and started to slap me in the face calling me some bitch or something, honestly, at the time, I really enjoyed it but right after I cummed all over his face, I felt really GUILTY and very dirty for he cummed all over my eyes and mouth I felt like an abused whore, could someone help me?

2015-05-10‎Violent media usually prevents real life violence and I can easily be generic and pull this little chart out to prove it. (check the attached image) http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/video-games/8676954/Doom-creator-John- Carmack-violent-video-games-reduce-real-world-aggression.html Like I said earlier, a newly 13 yr old kid from my town downright killed himself. He had a upper-middle class family (200,000 / yr ) .. which confuses me as to why they would move to this ugly, redneck rundown desert shithole of a town.. Anyways, he fucking kills himself from all the bullshit from the town. I usually take daily walks, ever since 2014 when I stopped being as much as a shut- in. I casually talk to a few people here and there. I remember having a few lengthy conversations with folks, and when it was relevant to the subject being discussed, I probably brought up the story of the kid a few times. You know what they all said about that kid? He was a sinner and deserved it. Those arent my words, they're the words of the redneck shitheads here. They're all mormon psychopaths addicted to tobacco and meth driving shitty pickup trucks from the 70s. You know the movie naoplean dynamtie? Imagine that but with 50x more hostility in the rednecks, and all the scenery replaced by ugly light-tan wasteland covered with weeds everywhere. My point? you cant blame that kid for killing himself. I'm not supporting his decision, because most suicidal people are usually good people at heart. Most victims of suicide ARE NOT REMEMBERED. I've spoken to the parents of this child and inspired them to do what the parents of Ryan Halligan did and perhaps make a memorial site and do public speaking on behalf of the bloke. Now with that being said, the bloke still had great parents and a nice house, but it's not like that would really counter the fact that the people we're surrounded with are thrice as scary as southerners. Weise lived far away from a lot of american civilization in a fucking rez. You all know his life story by now so it should be of no surprise why he was so dark and disturbed. To wrap this tl;dr post up.. The reason why most modern mass murderers exist is because they know for a fact that suicide alone would just leave them forgotten forever. But if they pull the trigger and take out some random people with them, the media will make them the talk of (not only the town) but the nation and perhaps even the world. Red Lake was on-par with columbine, and yet only got 1% as much attention. You know why? Because they were all native americans- minorities. Even still, a lot of people still faintly remember it 10 years later. Imagine if weise never went postal. Maybe a dozen would've known about it enough to turn a glance his way for a moment, maybe his grandpa would care. It's the killer's fault for the tragedy, but society's fault for making the killers.

2014-01-01‎Sex between an unmarried man and woman - I think saving yourself (whatever gender you are) until marraige is stupid not because I'm against the idea of loyalty, but because once you get married, the sex stops. Marriage is a scam and 80% of divorces are made by women. I hate the idea of sexual casualization. If you're gonna bone someone make sure it's during a relationship. I think that's a reasonable, non-extremist and level-headed opinion.. Divorce The effects of divorce are extensive and cause a lot of conflict on families. Elliot Rodger dealt with family divorce. Same with adam lanza. And btw 80% of divorces are initiated by women. They don't marry for love, they just marry for alimony and taking all our stuff. HAHAHAHAHAHAHA so much for feminism. Having a baby outside of marriage You should only have a baby if you're married, and only after you've given it plenty of time that you have good faith that it'll work out.

You're just in the closet when all you think about is gay people dude. Medical research using stem cells from human embryos Let's hold back scientific and technological progress! Pornography I love porn to an extent but between mormon idiocy of banning porn and liberal degeneracy like San francisco I think being in the middle of that debate is the only logical thing you can do. Access to porn decreases rape. But at the same time most porn is messed up nowadays. Suicide Suicide is society's fault.

‎to the United States. As he was just becoming a director, he believed Los Angeles would offer more opportunities. We took a short trip to California to gain an initial look at it. I don’t remember much of this trip, but I do remember having a good time. At the age of 4, I, Elliot Rodger, had already been to six different countries. Who can claim that, eh? The United Kingdom, France, Spain, Greece, Malaysia, and the United States. It was also during this time that my mother became pregnant again. I was going to have a sibling. My parents decided to have another baby, this pregnancy being planned, so that I can have a sibling to grow up with. We later discovered it was going to be a girl. Before my 5th birthday, my mother went into labor to deliver the baby. I can remember the night vividly. I was very ill that night, a bad omen. I stayed at home with Ah Mah while my mother and father were at the hospital, and we watched movies together. I was fraught with anticipation the whole time. And then my parents came back late in the night, and with them they brought a little black-haired baby wrapped in a bundle. I had a baby sister, and they named her Georgia. I have no memories of what happened on my 5th birthday. Shortly after it, we were making plans to permanently move to the United States. The news excited me, but I was sad at the prospect of leaving my life in England behind. My father took a short trip to the U.S. by himself to scout out houses. I remember talking on the phone to him while he was there. He told me he found a very nice house for us to move to. I asked him if it had a swimming pool, and he said it did. This news made me very happy. And then the time came. We started packing everything up at the Old Rectory. On my last day at Dorsett House school, my teacher was giving all of us candies when my mother came to pick me up early. I said goodbye to all the friends I had there. That was the last time I saw them. My father was given the offer to buy the Old Rectory for about 400,000 Pounds (we were only renting it at the time), but he declined, a decision he would regret later on, as it would have been a worthy investment. I cried as we drove away from the Old Rectory. All the experiences I had there; playing in the fields, driving my toy tractor, tending to my garden, going on walks with Ah Mah, swinging on the swing; all those experiences were gone. I was about to start a new life. We boarded the plane and took off to America. Part 2 Growing up in America Age 5-9 The plane ride was like a dimension between worlds.

Niggs and spics bring it on to themselves, and another thing, I am very racist towards white trash P.O.S.’s like and they deserve the hatred, otherwise I probably wouldn’t hate them. It’s a tragedy, the human nature of people will lead to their downfall. People’s human nature will get them killed. Whether by me or Vodka, it’s happened before, and not just school shootings like those pussy dumbasses over in Minnesota who squealed. Throughout history, its our fucking nature! I know how people are and why and I can’t stand it! I love the Nazis too . . . by the way, I fucking can’t get enough of the swastika, the SS, and the iron cross. Hitler and his head boys fucked up a few times and it cost them the war, but I love their beliefs and who they were, what they did, and what they wanted. I know that form of government couldn’t have lasted long once the human equation was brought in, but damn it, it sure looked good. Every form of government leads to downfalls, everything will always fuck up or yeah something. It’s all doomed, god damn it. This is beginning to make me get in a corner. I’m showing too much of myself, my views and thoughts, people might start to wonder, smart ones will get nosy and something might happen to fuck me over, I might need to put on one helluva mask here to fool you all some more. Fuck fuck fuck. It’ll be very fucking hard to hold out until April. If people would give me more compliments all of this might still be avoidable . . . but probably not. Whatever I do people make fun of me, and sometimes directly to my face. I’ll get revenge soon enough. Fuckers shouldn’t have ripped on me so much huh! Ha! Then again it’s human nature to do what you did . . . so I guess I am also attacking the human race. I can’t take it, it’s not right . . . true . . . correct . . . perfect. I fucking hate the human equation. Nazism would be fucking great if it weren’t for individualism and our natural instinct to ask questions. You know what maybe I just need to get laid. Maybe that’ll just change some shit around. That’s another thing, I am a fucking dog. I have fantasies of just taking someone and fucking them hard and strong. Someone like where I just pick her up, take her to my room, tear off her shirt and pants and just eat her out and fuck her hard. I love flesh . . . weisses fleisch!

‎of hope, of course, would be shattered as well. During this Spring of 2013, I began to seriously think about planning the Day of Retribution. My next step towards planning for it was to buy my second handgun, a Sig Sauer P226. It is of a much higher quality than the Glock, and a lot more efficient. In turn, it was also a lot more expensive. My Glock 34 was around $700 dollars, whereas my new Sig Sauer P226 was $1100. These prices were of no concern to me, however. When I first moved to Santa Barbara and experienced all of those horrible revelations about the nature of humanity, I knew that something like the Day of Retribution could very well happen if the world continued to mistreat me. I began to carefully save up all of the money that my parent’s and grandmothers were sending me. It was an ample amount to live on, leaving me with a lot left over to build up in my bank account. When I hit the $5000 dollar mark, which was fairly soon after my move to Santa Barbara, I decided never to go under it, deeming that $5000 was enough to buy all of the supplies and equipment I would need if I had to do something like this. The Day of Retribution had always been in the back of my mind as a final solution if all else failed in my life, ever since I had moved to Santa Barbara. As it so happened, all else did indeed fail. Women continued to reject me and mistreat me, and I remained an unwanted virgin. For the last months of Spring, I went home a lot because the loneliness in Santa Barbara was too stifling. Going home to visit my parents was always an emotional refuge for me. During these trips home, I spent a lot of time with my little brother Jazz. My father let me drive his Mercedes SUV while I was in town, and I often took Jazz on outings with it. On these outings, I began to really bond with the boy. We went to places like Barnes & Noble, the playground at the park, and local cafés where I treated him to coffee and pastries. The parks I took him to were Serrania Park and the Woodland Hills recreation center. I like to watch him play in the playground at these parks, because those were the exact same playgrounds I played in when I was his age... When my life as actually happy. As I watched him, I dreamed about that happy life I used to live, before my whole world turned to darkness. I realized how much different my brother Jazz was from me at that age. While I was shy, short, and physically weak; Jazz was tall for his age and very social. He had no problem going up to other boys at the playground and making instant friends. I began to form a bitter envy towards him, though I hid it really well. My little brother‎Elliot Rodger‎1

Was it the first inkling of sexual desire in my body? I was traumatized. My childhood was fading away. Ominous fear swept over me, and I stopped talking to that person. As the Sixth Grade year came to a close, I felt dissatisfied and insignificant. Indeed, a whole new world had opened up before me, and I had no idea how to prevail in it. I still wanted to live as a child. I never established any proper friends at Pinecrest, and the only playdate I had was the one with Connor that my mother arranged, and that turned out to be a disaster for me. My mother and father both showed concern that I wasn’t making any friends, but because I still saw some friends from Topanga, they didn’t make a big deal out of it. I consider Sixth Grade to be the better year out of the three years I would spend in Middle School. Girls actually paid attention to me. They knew who I was and I didn’t feel like I was completely invisible. I was extremely shy with girls and could barely have a conversation with them, but I still interacted with girls more during this year than I would for any following year. The cool kids treated me nicely, despite my reputation as the “quiet kid”. I always felt like a loser compared to them, and I hated them for it, though I still wanted their approval. I wanted to be one of them... I wanted to be their friend. The closest I came to truly being one of them was when Vinny and Robert both invited me to their birthday parties, which were only a couple of weeks apart at the very end of the school year. Both parties were at Skatelab skatepark. I hadn’t been to Skatelab for about a year, and when I walked in, all of the memories of going there with James filled my mind. I hadn’t even skateboarded for a while, but after a few minutes on the ramps my ability came back like magic. They were all quite impressed. I bet they thought I would end up sucking at it. I was happy to prove them wrong. Indeed, Sixth Grade was the peak of my life at Pinecrest. It would only go downhill from there. My mother bought me a brand new video game console, the Xbox. I heard a lot of kids talking about how great the Xbox was at school, so I was really eager to have one. I liked the Xbox much more than the Playstation 2. The graphics were better and the games were more to my taste. With the Xbox, I got the game Halo. At first, I found Halo to be very difficult and I gave up on it a few times.

I’ll probably end up nuking everything and fucking robbing some gun collector’s house. Fuck, that’ll be hard. Oh well, just as long as I kill a lot of fucking people. Everyone is always making fun of me because of how I look, how fucking weak I am and shit, well I will get you all back, ultimate fucking revenge here. You people could have shown more respect, treated me better, asked for my knowledge or guidance more, treated me more like a senior, and maybe I wouldn’t have been so ready to tear your fucking heads off. Then again, I have always hated how I looked, I make fun of people who look like me, sometimes without even thinking sometimes just because I want to rip on myself. That’s where a lot of my hate grows from. The fact that I have practically no self-esteem, especially concerning girls and looks and such. Therefore people make fun of me . . . constantly . . . therefore I get no respect and therefore I get fucking PISSED. As of this date I have enough explosions to kill about 100 people, and then if I get a couple bayonets, swords, axes, whatever I’ll be able to kill at least 10 more. And that just isn’t enough! Guns! I need guns! Give me some fucking firearms!‎Eric Harris‎1

‎I sit here all alone. I am always alone. I don’t know who I am. I want to be something I can never be. I try so hard every day. But in the end, I hate myself for what I’ve become. Every single person I know means nothing to me. I hate every person on this earth. I wish they could all go away.The only reason I stay alive is because of hope. Even though I am repulsive and few peopleknow who I am, I still feel that things might, maybe, just a little bit, get better. I don’t understand any fucking person on this earth. Some of you are so weak, mainly, that a four year old could push you down. I am strong, but my head just doesn’t work right. I know I should be happy with what I have, but I hate living. Every time I talk to her, I have a small amount of hope. But then she will tear it right down. It feels like my heart is breaking. But is that possible. I am so consumed with hate all of the time. Could I ever love anyone? I have feelings, but do I have a heart that’s not black and full of animosity? I know everyone thinks this way sometimes, but I am so full of rage that I feel I could snap at any moment. I think about it everyday. Blowing the school up or just taking the easy way out, and walk into a pep assembly with guns. In either case, people that are breathing will stop breathing. That is how I will repay all you mother fuckers for all you put me through. I feel like everyone is against me, but no one ever makes fun of me, mainly because they think I am a psycho. There is one kid above all others that I want to kill. I want nothing more than to put a hole in his head. The one reason I don’t: Hope. That tomorrow will be better. As soon as my hope is gone, people die. I ask myself why I hate more than anyone else. I don’t know. But my head and heart want him dead. He only knows who I am through reputation, and I know he is scared of me. He should be. One bad day, and there will be a sawed off shotgun in his face or five pounds of Semtex under his bed. I need help. There is one person that could help, but she won’t. I need to find someone else. I think I love her, but she could never love me. I don’t know why I try. Oh fuck. I sound so pitiful. People would laugh at this if they read it. I hate being laughed at. But they won’t laugh after they’re scraping parts of their parents, sisters, brothers, and friends from the wall of my hate. Please. Someone, help me. All I want is something small. Nothing big. I just want to be happy. End. New day. Today of‎Kip Kinkel‎1
2003-06-07‎"Where are we?,""Annie asked her husband Draven. ""We're about thirty miles away from Chicago, I know that much, but I'm not sure exactly where we are, we might be in Minnesota, ""Draven replied looking at his road map. Annie brushed her dark red hair away from her face and began checking her Baretta.Draven looked over at his beautiful wife Annie,they had met a few minutes after he had shot a lawyer on the street's of Chicago from a rooftop with a PSG-1 supressed sniper rifle a year before. He was in a rush to get away from the area,since the lawyer was under police protection and they'd surely have about forty pigs searching the area. Draven had to get rid of the rifle,so he wiped his prints off the trigger and grip and tossed it off the roof top,amazingly,it impaled a police officer as he checked the lawyer for a pulse. Draven met Annie as she was in the same building, strangling one of the employee's to death with a peice of Piano wire on the staircase,Draven fell in love with her at first site. Two contract killer's meeting on the same day with their target's dead a few minutes apart. They both made a smooth escape through the back exit. Draven had never heard of Annie,but she worked for the same guy as he did. Mr.Runey,an Irish mobster. As soon as the shit hit the fan Runey was killed in an assination by a black gangster name Tay.But that was in the past, Draven was now looking for his freind Grey, Ironicaly he was another contract killer. A creature lumbered forward,creeping up on Draven and Annie's parked car.It picked up a rock and slowly made it's way over to the back window, it started to hit the glass window, but the window didn't brake because of the lack of energy the creature had. ""Shit, let's get that peice of shit before he brakes our window,""Annie said climbing out of the car.Draven followed. ""Hey you, yeah you rotten mother fucker!,""Annie shouted taunting the creature, beckoning it to come closer. As she did Draven snuck up behind it, Annie grinned as Draven grabbed ahold of it's shirt and jerked it back knocking it off balance,Draven cocked the hammer back on his .45 and stuck the barrel in it's mouth squeezing the trigger,blood shot up and hit him on the face. Annie started to laugh. ""God damn it!,""Draven said whiping the blood off his face. Draven looked at her and smiled as they climbed back into the car..."‎Jeffrey Weise‎1

2014-01-01‎Women have always had it easy. Us men cannot have any emotion, we have to be into sports and killing, and we have to be strong. Women are only expected to use up our resources and -- in a distant past, take care of the family unit. Modern women, however, don't raise their kids. I know my little brother's best friend lived in a household with a single mother. She was 250+ pounds, made him do all of the chores and cleaning, and ignored the two youngest children. Those kids have spent most of their time playing video games instead of being taught values and morality. They will not have anything to reflect back on when they are older, and it is likely they will grow up weaker physically and mentally than would be. That single mother? She married a jock football player at age 17, only to divorce him 8 years later and stunt the family. 50$ says she probably had some nice guy friends who she neglected or treated like shit. If she married one of the nerds / nice guys, I'd guarantee the entire family would be better off. Women ignore and bully nice guys, and leave them to be rather miserable and rejected for their lifetime. The intellectuals and benevolent people usually never get laid and get bullied well into adulthood. It doesn't really change after high school. Yet retards, gearheads, and douchebags get rewarded for their idiocies. This is evidence enough that women are stupid. Dish in the constant nagging, gold- digging, manipulating, hypersexuality, cheating and so many other aspects of the typical 'liberated' woman, and anyone who doesn't have their head in their ass will agree that civilization has a major moral crisis going on. And yet for what I have just said, I would be shunned by most people, even though it's the reality. P.C. degenerates are destroying society.‎William Atchison‎1

Perhaps when they  come out with Postal 4 (If they ever do)  Not just the graphics, but there should be more to do, other than just  shooting people for no reason, there needs to be a plot, and a good  story line. But i doubt Vince Desi cares what i have to say :(  And there should be music, a good soundtrack, with tunes from  Marilyn Manson, Rammstein, Disturbed, and many others, you know  what kinda' bands we like. Mmmmmm, what else, what else? Make it  longer, ummmmmm, you know the kind'a things i want, and also  make a small additional game, just like the first postal game, but with  graphics of today (that'll just be a little fun thingy on the side) All  concentration showld be on the main game, guess it'll have to be for  Postal 4 cuz' the 3rd ones already being made.  Hope no one kills the makers of the Postal game, cuz' those guys  rock. If someone does attack ""Running With Scissors"" or any of you  guys, it'll be those religious fanatics, like those guys that kill abortion  doctors and stuff, so watch out!!  I also heard that the Postal movie was gonna suck, not that i know  anything, but it's better to postpone production and make it really,  really, really, good. Instead of rushing it. It shoul'd be a blockbuster  movie, that everyone on earth wants to watch, or will want to watch  after they here about it from their friends.  You gotta bring Postal into the mainstream. I want more people tosee what I see. By changing the format of the game and movie, you  can do it. Just a little, the basis of Postal dude should stay the same,  just gotta be a better story line. Lets get to know Postal dude's  girlfriend, the places he worked at, the people that pissed him off, all  that stuff, in detail, like a real kick ass game/movie  (Postal dude was sad before he became angry and psychotic, that's  the part we're never seen in the game. He was normal, but the world  made him the way he became, gotta show that in the game and  movie too) ‎Kimveer Gill‎1

‎from watching typical American shows on television. I thought it was something I had to do in order to be cool. I was very nervous, naturally, but I pushed myself to go ahead with it. When I got there, Robert Morgan saw me and asked me if I wanted to hang out with his group. I was grateful for this, and I ended up having a nice time. I was shocked that some 7th and 8th grade girls offered to dance with me. They came up to me in a group and taught me how to “slow dance”. I had to place my hands on their hips, while they placed their hands on my shoulders, and we would move slowly with the music. They were all taller than me, and I was terrified, but it felt so... good. That would be the only time in my life where I would have a satisfying experience with girls. The only time. Halloween of this year marked the last time I would ever go trick-or-treating. After this year I would be too old for it. Mother took us to the Lemelson’s, and I decided to not dress up in any costume. I went as myself, sporting my black Pinecrest sweater. As it was my last time trick-or-treating, it would be the last time I would have any sort of fun on Halloween. And I did have a lot of fun. It was nice to go out collecting candy with James and Noah, like we had been doing for several years past. My father cut off a portion of the child support he had been paying my mother, which forced my mother to move house. We moved to a small blue house on Glade Avenue in Canoga Park. I didn’t like Canoga Park at all. It was a very ugly and low-class area to the north or Woodland Hills, and I felt it demeaning that we would have to live there during mother’s week. The house did have some upsides. It had four bedrooms and a bigger living room than mother’s old house. My new room was a lot larger than my old one. And of course, my mother always had her own ways of making everything better. I would still enjoy my time at mother’s small house more than my time at father’s big Woodland Hills house. Along with this move, there came a new change in our rotation schedule. My parents decided that we would stay at our mother’s house more, instead of switching one week-one week. Mother would have us for all of the weekdays, and we would go to father’s on the weekends when he was in town. Around the same time that my mother moved, James’s family moved as well, to another Lemelson- owned house in the Palisades. They would only remain in this house for a very brief period, because a tragic event would soon occur in James’s family. One day at school, I was sitting in my class when I was suddenly called to the office. My mother‎Elliot Rodger‎1

2011-01-31‎It seems like an irrelevant question to be concerned about. No one can obtain knowledge about what happens after death, nor if anything is required to do for the deceased. If some ritual was necessary, no one could know about it nor have any knowledge about the requirements of it. Perhaps there's a magical platypus who requires that you burn a wooden effigy of a hamster so that the deceased can ride it to the gates of Valhalla. From observing other people who have died, the only conclusion which can be reached is that nothing happens. Treating death as if it's the end of everything would be the most prudent course of action because believing that something happens is contrary to the observable world of the life which you are certain about having, thus deluding you into behaving in a way which could negatively impact your life.‎Adam Lanza‎1

‎chance. Instead, I was all alone, and I had to see another couple watch movies together in that very theatre. Thankfully, that couple only stayed for a few hours. Mother invited a few more guests, and we ordered our dinner to be delivered from a local restaurant. By the time dinner arrived, I had already consumed three glasses of wine, and I had a fourth glass with the meal. Everything’s better with some wine in the belly, as a famous character from Game of Thrones would say. I was left out of most of the conversations, like I always was, so I just sat there quietly, sipping my wine as I had to bear listening to Maddy talk about how awesome her life was. I excused myself as soon as I finished eating, and boy did I stuff myself on that meal. I then walked outside onto the beach. The wine had long since gone to my head, making me feel a sense of dizzy invigoration. I started walking along the shore, taking in the magnificence of the gentle, moonlit ocean. It was so... romantic. I kept walking and walking with no destination in mind. The romance of it all filled me with despair and longing. I wanted a girlfriend to experience that moment with me, but no girl wanted to be my girlfriend. The only thing I could do was imagine how heavenly it would be to have a beautiful girl by my side. It is such a shameful tragedy. I ended up walking for two hours, and at the end of it I was crying to myself because I felt so sad. When I returned to the house, Maddy and her boyfriend had left, and so did most of the guests. The only guests who remained were my mother’s friends Alan and Rebecca, and their sons, as they were spending the nights there with us. I spent the rest of my time there relaxing and watching movies in the theatre. We watched the entire Jurassic Park trilogy, which brought back fond memories of my childhood. I went on a few more walks on the beach during the daytime. That beach was always quiet and peaceful, since the only people who visited it were those who lived in homes on the beach. I took full advantage of this. I’ve always found beaches to be truly beautiful, but I could never go to public beaches because they are full of young couples walking around in their revealing bathing suits, the sight of which fills me with envious rage. On the private beach, I could enjoy the serenity of the environment without having to worry about young couples making me jealous. There were no young couples, only a few families and old couples here and there. I did, however, pass by one young girl, and she was like a goddess who came down from heaven. She was walking alone, in her bathing suit, with her luscious blonde hair blowing in the wind. I couldn’t help but slyly admire her beauty as we‎Elliot Rodger‎1

""Surviving the Dead."" 1 The small town of Grovers Mill sat somewhere East, nearly forgotten by all except those who lived there. It was after eleven and dark as most stormy night's are, rain hammered down on the town relentlessly accompanied by it's usual acquaintances thunder and lightening. It's dull barren street's were completely void of anything living, all the shop's had closed for the night and everyone was in their warm bed's dreaming simple dreams. The shadowy figure stood on the outskirt's of the town's eastern border looking from side to side making sure it was clear, the black storm poncho kept his black jumpsuit and tactical gear safe from the rain. He tilted the cap of his black battle helmet upwards so that he could see better, seeing the coast was clear he shifted his M-16 to his right hand and brought up his flashlight pointing it down the opposite direction of the road flicking it off and on twice. In the distance through the falling rain a pair of headlight's flicked on after seeing his signal, the man put his flash light away and took the M-16 into both arm's once again as the truck slowly started to drive forward. The truck came to a rustic stopped near the town's morgue, a one story tall concrete monstrosity with a freshly mowed lawn with lush green grass looking almost fake. From the passengers side another man jumped out dressed in the same manner as the signaler had been. The looming military figure removed his talk box from his tactical belt and pressed down the talk button, speaking a single word. ""Mask's."" Hearing him over the radio the driver pulled a gas mask up from the floor of the truck and quickly put it on, those on the military hummer that had escorted the transport truck slid their mask's on too. The passenger from the transport truck slid on his gas mask moving towards the back of the truck, he climbed onto the bed and removed a single barrel, he set it down on the wet concrete and looked for the keypad somewhere on it's top. He punched in a four digit code on the keypad attached to the barrel and with a loud pop the top opened releasing a plume of yellow smoke, quickly he moved to the front of the truck jumping into the passenger's side. He picked up the CB radio, ""GO GO GO!,"" his tone was frantic and frightened. The transport truck quickly backed out of the morgue parking lot and sped off towards the western exit followed by it's escort. Unbeknownst to the townsfolk ""Operation Paperclip"" had just begun...

‎hang out with a blonde girl, despite the fact that she was a hired friend. It was the only time in my life that I had the experience of spending time with a girl my age, and even though it was all fake, I really enjoyed it. I felt so much better about life after each time we met. But then, I thought about how unfair it was that I could only get a fake little taste of such an experience, while other men get to do such a thing every single day with their girlfriends. Eventually, Sasha had to move out of Santa Barbara, and I decided not to have any more female counsellors. It has the same effect as hiring a prostitute, I imagine. It temporarily feels good for the moment, but afterward it makes one feel like a pathetic loser for having to hire a girl when other men could get the experience for free. In July, I spent a lot of time exercising in my room in a final effort to appear as attractive as possible to girls. I proposed that after two weeks of rigorous exercising, I will try my hardest to go out in Isla Vista and do everything I can to meet a girl and lose my virginity. It had been a long time since I went out to Isla Vista by myself, but I knew that I had to do it. I had nothing to lose, and my whole life was on the line. Before would set the definite decision to plan the Day of Retribution, I wanted to give women and humanity one more chance to accept me and give me a chance to have a pleasurable youth. I resolved that if I go out to Isla Vista for this final time, and I still end up going back to my room as a lonely virgin, I will have no choice but to plan my Retribution. I even attended college at SBCC again. I signed up for a summer sociology class and attended it for a week, before dropping it out of the familiar frustration of girls talking to other boys instead of me. This last ditch effort of desperation to once again try to live an enjoyable college life in Isla Vista came to an ultimate and devastating culmination on Saturday night, July 20th, just a few days before my 22nd Birthday. It was the day that I decided to go out in Isla Vista in an attempt to lose my virginity before I turned 22. That was the only thing that could have saved me. I was giving the female gender one last chance to provide me with the pleasures I deserved from them. I was too nervous to go out there sober, so I bought a bottle of vodka and took a few shots to garner enough courage to walk out at such an hour. I had taken one too many, for by the time I reached Del Playa Street, my head was clouded with drunkenness. At the start,‎Elliot Rodger‎1

‎everything I wanted to do! Why him and not me? I cursed at the world. What was seen can never be unseen, and I will never forget it, nor will I forgive it. My hope that I will one day have a beautiful girlfriend and live the life I desire slowly faded away. I was in the same dark and miserable place I had been a year previously; lonely, unwanted, miserable, and seething with rage at the world. I kept thinking about how some boys were easily able to get girlfriends straight after they went through puberty. I couldn’t fathom how they did it, and I hated and despised them for it. I kept thinking about Leo Bubenheim, and how he kissed that girl Nicole at the Sagebrush Cantina when he was only twelve. Twelve! He was able to have an intimate experience with a girl when he was only twelve; and there I was at eighteen, still a kissless virgin. My envy of Leo became an obsession. I kept asking my sister for information about him, but she refused to tell me anything. I frightfully wondered if he had lost his virginity already, and he most likely had. He was a popular kid, and girls desired him. Leo was happily living his heavenly life with the knowledge that he’s worth something to the world, while I had to wallow in my misery and loneliness. Life is not fair. One can either accept that fact, keeling over in defeat; or one can harness the strength to fight against it. My destiny was to fight against the unfairness of the world. My mother carried on pressuring me to get a job, and she would never leave me alone about it. She was a bit frustrated that I wasn’t getting one. The two of us had a lot of arguments, and living with my mother became an extreme hassle. After signing me up to a program in the regional center, my mother found a life coach to counsel me and help me find a job. This life coach’s name was Tony, a boisterous 40 year old man who came to meet me every other week. I was open to going along with this. I had plenty of free time, and I was so lonely that any social interaction was welcome. For our meetings, Tony usually took me out to lunch somewhere in the Valley, where he gave me advice on socializing and self-improvement. I continued searching for a job, but I still wasn’t able to find one. I refused all of the jobs that Tony suggested to me. The problem was that most of the jobs that were available to me at the time were jobs I considered to be beneath me. My mother wanted me to get a simple retail job, and the thought of myself doing that was mortifying. It would be completely against my character. I am an intellectual who is destined for greatness. I would never perform a low-class service job. My father told me that I could work‎Elliot Rodger‎1
‎up. The new Song of Ice and Fire book, A Dance with Dragons, was released. I emailed my mother to order me the book from Amazon. The countdown was ultimately over, and I had nothing to show for it. I was still a virgin, even after a month of living in a town full of college kids who had sex all the time. I realized that I had only twelve more days as a teenager! I was going to turn twenty very soon. One of my hopes was to at least lose my virginity before my time as a teenager was over. Being a virgin at the age of twenty would make me feel very defeated. I made a bid to do everything I could to lose my virginity in those few remaining days I had. With a tremendous amount of panic, I wondered what I could possible do. The only thing I could think of was to go out to the common areas of Isla Vista as much as possible. I had to put myself out there, even if it only increased my chances of having sex by one percent. One percent was still better than zero. For those crucial twelve days I had left as a teenager, I walked over to the center of Isla Vista every day and sat at one of the tables outside Domino’s Pizza, hoping against hope that a girl would come up and talk to me. Why wouldn’t they? I looked good enough, didn’t I? Or did I not look good enough? Such thoughts flew through my head in frantic waves. For dinner, I always walked over to the healthy restaurant called Silvergreen’s. There were always hot girls there, but none of them deigned to even look at me. On every one of those nights, I walked home alone, with my head down in defeat. I made no progress in school either. My geography class had no pretty girls in it, so I had no hope there. I spent a lot of time sitting in the cafeteria area, but all of the beautiful girls I saw intimidated me too much. One time, as I was walking across the huge bridge that connected the two campuses, I passed by a girl I thought was pretty and said “Hi” as we neared each other. She kept on walking and didn’t even have the grace to respond to me. How dare she! That foul bitch. I felt so humiliated that I went to one of the school bathrooms, locked myself in a toilet stall, and cried for an hour. On one of my very last days as a teenager, as I was sitting at my usual place at the food court outside Domino’s, I saw a sight that shattered my heart to pieces. A tall, blonde, jock-type guy walked into one of the restaurants, and at his side was one of the sexiest girls I had ever seen. She too was tall and blonde. They were both taller than me, and they kissed each other passionately. They‎Elliot Rodger‎1
‎people who were clients of Net Jets, a private jet company. Rob had no interest in such things, so he gave the tickets to my mother. I was eager to go, because I loved attending exclusive events; it made me feel special. For most of the time spent at the concert, I just walked around at ate food at the buffet tables while everyone waited for Katy Perry to perform. There was upbeat music playing the entire time, and a lot of wealthy families with their kids attended. Every family there must have had a net worth of at least twenty million, to be able to hire private jets. I tried to pretend as if I was part of a wealthy family. I should be. That was the life I was meant to live. I WOULD BE! If only my damnable mother had married into wealth instead of being selfish. If only my failure of a father had made better decisions with his directing career instead wasting his money on that stupid documentary. I couldn’t help but feel a bitter form of envy at all of the rich kids at the concert. They grew up in lavish mansions, indulged in excessive opulence, and will never have to worry about anything in their pleasurable, hedonistic lives. I would take great pleasure in watching all of those rich families burn alive. Looking at all of them really drilled in my mind the importance of wealth. Wealth is one of the most important defining factors of self-worth and superiority. I hated and envied all of those kids for being born into wealth, while I had to struggle to find a way to claim wealth for myself. I had to be ruthless, and do whatever it takes to attain such wealth. After all, it was my only hope of ever being worthy of getting a girlfriend and living the life of gratification that I desire. The red carpet premiere of the Hunger Games was an even more exclusive event. The reason we got in was because my father was friends with the director, Gary Ross. My father even contributed to the film as a second unit director. Gary Ross had been coming over to father’s house for dinner quite frequently in the past few months. When he told me about the Hunger Games, I had never heard about it before, so I decided to read the books that the movie would be based on. It was quite an enjoyable story and I became a fan. At the same time, my step mother Soumaya was in the process of filming a French reality T.V. series, called Les Vraies Housewives. Her status as a reality T.V. star, coupled with my father’s important association with Gary Ross, enabled us all to attain VIP tickets to the red carpet premiere, including admittance to walk on the red carpet itself, which was actually a black carpet, in a literal sense.

‎bypass surgery: I consulted 2 cardiac surgeons and both did not recommend it, while the cardiologists, who did recommend bypass surgery, were not surgeons themselves. Next, I reminded Mayrand that it was her colleague Ayas, who recommended the angioplasty and he did it because he felt my life to be in danger. Mayrand still insisted that I had to undergo bypass surgery, she could not though tell bypass surgery of WHICH artery. Finally, she understood the stupidity of her position and hastily exited. While she was getting out, I told her that as soon as she figured out which artery should be bypassed, I agree in advance. Several minutes later, she returned back and admitted that it were indeed Quebec surgeons, who did NOT recommend bypass surgery. Her next idea was to call B.C. doctor and ask him whether he would be ready to perform a new angioplasty, and if yes, she would send me there. Imagine the stupidity: to go from one end of the country to another for an elementary procedure, which can be easily done here. By the evening of July 16, 2002, I was finally told that the angiography will be done at the Sacre-Coeur hospital on July 19. I guess, Quebec doctors understood that their actions were clear and shameless murder, so they backed off. Angioplasty was performed on July 19, 2002, and it showed that I was right yet gain: jail doctor Coche brought me to the brink of death indeed. Almost all arteries were re-stenosed, and the main Right Coronary artery was blocked 80%; a small clot there would kill me for sure. It also showed that Quebec doctors were perfectly qualified to do the job, and were refusing out of maliciousness, helping Canadian Government to kill me. On my return from the hospital I spoke with jail doctor Coche. I asked him whether the results of the last angioplasty convinced him that he made serious mistakes by ignoring my symptoms for over 3 weeks, by refusing to call an ambulance, and by effectively bringing me to the brink of death yet again. He admitted that I could have died, but insisted that he did nothing wrong. In 1994, a guard has broken my ribs and a doctor did her best to cover up this crime. I complained to police, they not only refused to press charges, they did not even bother to interview the criminal guard, though they had in their possession a video-tape of the crime. I went to court against the doctor also, and judge Goodwin decided that I had not a shred of evidence (look for another posting for details). CONCLUSION I was abused for 12 years, and when my life was threatened, the abusers succeeded in provoking me. I lived so far 62 years, during which I never displayed any violent behavior, I never had even a speeding ticket; there were 3 minutes in my life when I killed 4 people. Should I be judged by these 3 minutes or by remaining 62 years? I was the victim, not‎Valery Fabrikant‎1
‎an awesome time learning how to skateboard and hacky sack. It was memorable year filled with joyful experiences. I didn’t want the school year to end. Once Fifth grade was over, I will have to go to Middle School, and the prospect filled me with anxiety. My little innocent mind always looked at Middle School as something far in the future, when I grow up. I didn’t want to grow up. I was enjoying my life as a kid right at that moment. I didn’t think about the future. Kids in my class told many rumors of Middle School life that filled me with fear and sent a shiver through my spine. Even through watching movies and T.V. shows I got a glimpse of what was in store for a Middle Schooler. There was talk of girls, and how it would soon be “cool” to be popular with the girls. Girls were like completely foreign creatures to me. I never interacted with them... I wasn’t expected to. In Elementary School, boys played with boys and girls played with girls. That was what I was used to. That was my world. I heard stories of how boys are expected to start kissing girls in Middle School! Such things overwhelmed me. I tried to dismiss it as much as I could and enjoy my life in the present moment. My school arranged a camping trip for the entire Fifth Grade class before graduation day. At first I didn’t want to go because I would be away from my parents for five days, something I was never used to. I was afraid I would get too homesick. I never spent more than one night away from my parents. On the rare occasion that they had to go out of town for a few days and left me with a nanny, I would cry at night. My teacher Mrs. Damart came up to me one morning before class started and persuaded me to go, saying that the graduation trip was something I wouldn’t want to miss. It would be a once in a lifetime experience, and after some hesitation I agreed to go along. I forgot exactly where this camping trip took place. It was located at a special camping retreat somewhere in the forest to the north of Los Angeles. It was very secluded... a small village of cabins and tents surrounded by wilderness and hiking trails. For the trip there, I decided to go with my friends Bryce and Charlie in a car instead of taking the school bus with everyone else. This was much more comfortable, and I was glad to have snagged a spot in the car with them. Everyone was assigned to groups of five to share a cabin or a tent. I was originally placed in the group with Charlie, Bryce, and a few others... but that group was given a tent to sleep in. I was appalled by how drab and uncomfortable the tents looked. I wanted a cabin. So I went to my teacher and asked to‎Elliot Rodger‎1

‎"2 Our second mission was against this complete and utter fag's house. Everyone in our school hates this immature little weakling. So we decided to ""hit"" his house. On Friday night (2/7/97) at about 12:15AM we arrived at this queer's house. Fully equiped with 3 eggs, 2 roles of toilet paper, the cheap brand, no pretty flowers. (we were disappointed to) superglue, and the proper tools to make his phone box a busy box (for those of you that are stupid, a buy box is where you set their box so that when they try to make a call, they get a busy signal and when someone else calls, they get a busy signal too). We placed 2 eggs in his very large, thick bushes. We just barely cracked them open so they will be producing a rather repulsive and extremely BAD odor for sometime. We placed the last egg on his ""welcome"" mat. It was very neat, I cracked the egg, put the yoke in the center, and the 2 halves on either side of the yoke. Then we teepeed his large pine tree and this...oak? tree. I dont know, Its big though. It wasnt a complete teepee but it was enough to agitate the home owner greatly.

She let go of the bars and jumped down, Max tried to catch her but she fell on him knocking them both over into the sewer water. Max kept his head above the surface, he didn't want to swallow any, sadly Morty wasn't so lucky, she shot up from the sewer water gasping for air. ""MAX!,"" she shouted angrily, ""YOU WERE SUPPOSED TO CATCH ME YOU IDIOT!"" Max helped her up. ""Sorry, I tried, but you came down at a funny angle...,"" he said trying to stifle a laugh. ""Oh sure,... erm... gross, now I smell like sewer water,"" she wiped her eye's with the back side of her right forearm. ""Where to now?,"" she asked. Max looked both way's down the nearly pitch black tunnel, lit only by dim light bulbs that hung from the ceiling of the sewer which seemed to be entangled with vines and brown roots of some kind, he shrugged his shoulders, ""don't ask me man, I just work here."" ""A man hole, we've got to find one,"" Morticia started down the right side of the sewer tunnel. ""How do you know that's the right way?,"" Max asked. She stopped and turned to him, ""Max, the town ain't that big if you haven't noticed. We're bound to run into one sooner or later, this place can't be that big."" Max stood still, looking in the opposite direction. Morticia stopped again, turning towards him once more, ""you coming or are you just gonna stand around with that 'I'm lost' look on your face all day?"" Max scoffed and unwillingly followed. Minutes later they found one, by now they were dreading the stench of the sewer, eager to get to the surface to the rain, the only thing they dreaded worse than the smell of the sewer was the flesh eating corpses which awaited them above. Max was the first up, since he was the one with the pistol, and probably had a better chance of being eaten first. Such a friend Morticia was. Max didn't let it get to him though, she was his best friend now, and if that meant getting nibbled on by ravenous corpses then so be it.

‎came over for a sleepover. We would play Nintendo 64 games like Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater and Donkey Kong late into the night, and then on Sunday morning mother would take us both to Skatelab, an indoor skatepark in Simi Valley. James had become really interested in skateboarding too, or so I believed. I was always better at it than him though, and I liked it that way. This was the way every weekend went during mother’s week, and I had the time of my life. I was so interested in skateboarding that I took my skateboard trick-or-treating for Halloween. My costume, of course, was myself as a skateboarder. We went to the Lemelson’s for a nice dinner and then set out to collect our candy. It was quite tricky to hold a bag full of candy while skateboarding, but I had fun. I remember some teenagers seeing me on my skateboard and saying “why didn’t I think of that”. Hah, that was gratifying. For Christmas, my mother bought me the new Playstation 2. I had been wanting it for a long time, and when I unwrapped the present and saw the box, I felt so elated. Beforehand, the only video game console I played was the Nintendo 64 (and the Gameboy, if that counts). The Playstation 2 was much more advanced in graphics, and it amazed me. When mother announced that I would have to share it with my sister Georgia and that I can’t keep it in my room, my excitement turned to indignation, and I threw quite a tantrum. After crying for a bit, I calmed down and settled to sharing it with Georgia. She wouldn’t be using it much anyways, I told myself. Even after getting a Playstation 2, I still played my Nintendo 64 a lot because I loved the games I had for it, and I had an emotional attachment to it. The Nintendo 64 was the first video game console I played, and it would always have a special place in my heart. One day during winter break at father’s house, father and Soumaya went out for a few hours and left me and my sister with Tracy. When they came back, they had a little puppy with them, and announced that it was our new pet. It was mainly a present for Georgia. Georgia had been desperately asking father for a pet puppy for the last year, but I didn’t think he would actually go through with it. I was so shocked that we now had a dog. I was always afraid of dogs when I was little, and I never imagined having one as a pet. The only pets I’ve had previously were my turtle and iguana, who both died within a year of acquiring them. Georgia was given the choice on what to name the puppy, and she named it Lucky. I thought this was a very lame and stupid name.

‎spell was astounding. I did my usual fantasizing about having sex with a beautiful, tall blonde-haired girl; but this time I intensified it a lot, and made up a whole story in my mind just to make the experience seem more real. If only it could be real. Some men get to live that fantasy, whereas I could only dream of it. Life is not fair. I finished the fourth book of the Song of Ice and Fire series. The television adaptation, Game of Thrones was coming out in just a few months, and I was really looking forward to that. I was also looking forward to the fifth book of the series, which had a release date of July 12th. After finishing all four books, I had become a huge fan of the series. It depicted a much more exciting world than the one I lived in, with a large array of complex characters, a few of whom I could really relate to. As I was reading up about the release date for the fifth book, I found an online countdown that showed each day, hour, minute, and second that remained until July 12th. Since July 12th was so close to my 20th birthday, I used this countdown as the official countdown of my last days as a teenager. I made it my internet homepage, and hoped that it would motivate me to do everything I can to change my life during this crucial period. Since I was back in father’s good graces, my mother agreed to meet with him and me to talk about my life situation. We had dinner at a Japanese restaurant, where we had a long talk about what I was doing in my life, and what my college plans were. My mother and father both agreed that in order to change my life, I needed to remove myself from my current environment and start anew. Living at my mother’s apartment was becoming unhealthy, and they thought that things would improve if I had my own place. It was at this moment that we began to form the Santa Barbara plan, in which I would go to college in Santa Barbara and live amongst the students there. The Santa Barbara plan was formed on that night, but its roots stretch all the way back to when I just turned eighteen. It was all because I watched that movie Alpha Dog. The movie had a profound effect on me, because it depicted lots of good looking young people enjoying pleasurable sex lives. I thought about it for many months afterward, and I constantly read about the story online. I found out that it took place in Santa Barbara, which prompted me to read about college life in Santa Barbara. I found out about Isla Vista, the small town adjacent to UCSB where all of the college students live and have parties. When I found out about all this, I had the desperate hope that if I moved to that town I would be able to live that‎Elliot Rodger‎1
‎While we were eating, some high school kids walked in. James saw them first, and right when he saw them he said the words “We’re fucked”. James knew I would have trouble with them. They were popular boys who had a flock of pretty girls with them. One of them sat down with two of the girls, putting his leg up on another chair with a cocky smirk on his face. I was livid with rage, and I wanted to pour my drink all over his head. James knew exactly what I was planning to do; we had been through similar incidents before. He made a lot of effort to try to dissuade me from acting on my anger, pointing out that there was a security guard nearby. I did the only other thing I could do; I packed up my dinner and left the restaurant, fleeing in defeat and shame. James soon followed, and we decided to finish our meal at his house. A dark and ominous aura clouded over our friendship that day. When the two of us got back to James’s house, I was still seething with rage. I didn’t understand why James wasn’t angry like me. The sight that we just witnessed was horrible to watch. To see another male be successful with females is torture for males like us who have no success with females. I was so angry that I told James of all of the acts of revenge I wanted to exact on those popular boys. I told him my desire to flay them alive, to strip the skins off their flesh and make them scream in agony as punishment for living a better life than me. James became deeply disturbed by my anger. I wished that he wasn’t disturbed. I wished he could be a friend that felt the same way about the world that I did. But he wasn’t that kind of person. He was a weakling. Once I had calmed down, the two of us had a long conversation in his room, and I ended up crying in front of him as I explained how hopeless I felt about life. Soon after that, I left his house, never to return there again. He will never invite me over after that incident, and our friendship will slowly fade to dust. During the last few days that I had to endure living with those barbaric housemates, I often walked out to Isla Vista hoping that I could meet a girl and take her home with me. I wanted to prove to them all that girls liked me, to see the look on their faces when they see a girl by my side. But of course, I had nothing to prove because girls didn’t like me. Every time I tried to go out and meet a girl, I ended up walking home alone in anger. On one of these nights, I crossed paths with a boy who was walking with two pretty girls. I got so envious that I cursed at them, and then‎Elliot Rodger‎1

I love you , You don’t consciously know who I am (please don’t skip to the back: read the note as it was written), & doubtedly unconsciously too. I, who write this, love you beyond infinince. I think about you all the time, how this world would be a better place if you loved me as I do you. I know what you’re thinking: “(some psycho wrote me this harassing letter)” I hoped we could have been together . . . you seem a bit like me. Pensive, quiet, an observer, not wanting what is offered here (school, life, etc.) you almost seem lonely, like me. You probably have a boyfriend though, & might not have given this note another thought. I have thought you my true love for a long time now, but . . . well . . . there was hesitation. You see I can’t tell if you think of anyone as I do you, & if you did who that would be. Fate put me in need of you, yet this earth blocked that with uncertainties. I will go away soon, but I just had to write this to you, the one I truly loved. Please, for my sake, don’t tell anybody about this, as it was only meant for you. Also, please don’t feel any guilt about my soon-to-be “absence” of this world (it is solely my decision: no one else’s) oh . . . the thoughts of us . . . doing everything together, not necessarily anything, just to be together would have been pure heaven. I guess it’s time to tell you who I am. I was in a class with you 1st semester, & was blessed with being with you in a report. I still remember your laugh. Innocent, beautiful, pure. This semester I still see you — rarely. I am entranced during 5th period, as we both have it off. To most people, I appear . . . well . . . almost scary, but that’s who I appear to be as people are afraid of what they don’t understand. I denied who I was for a long time. Until high school. . . . anyway, you have noticed me a few times, I catch every one of these gazes with an open heart. I think you know who I am by now. Unfortunately . . . even if you did like me even the slightest bit, you would hate me if you knew who I was. I am a criminal. I have done things that almost nobody would even think about condoning. The reason that I’m writing you now is that I have been caught for the crimes I committed, & I want to go to a new existence. You know what I mean (suicide).

‎girls don’t want to have sex with me. As a teenager and a young adult, Halloween has been a holiday of torment and depression because of this. In Isla Vista, this was greatly intensified. I tried my best to put myself out there on the Halloween weekend. I made many laps around Isla Vista, trying to bolster up the courage to talk to a girl or walk into a party, but I just couldn’t. I knew they would all reject me. What I saw during those walks shook me to the very core. Girls dressed up in extremely revealing outfits, and the sight of them filled my sex-starved self with hunger and desire that I knew I could never quench. On the last night of the Halloween weekend, I went out there with Andy and Stan and a few others. It made absolutely no difference. We didn’t get into any parties, and just walked around the streets like losers. Being friends with them wasn’t benefitting me at all. If only I had a beautiful girlfriend to experience such an event with! I would have even dressed up in a costume with her. It would have been so blissful and euphoric, to walk around in all of that excitement with a beautiful girl on my arm, to attend every single party because anyone would admit a beautiful girl into it, to make passionate love to her in my room at the end of the night, to snuggle next to her sexy warm body as we drift off to sleep together. THAT is the life I should have lived. So many other guys are able to experience that, and just thinking about if filled me with extreme agony. Life is not fair. In November, my brief friendship with Andy, Stan, and their group faded away. I often saw on Facebook that they did things together without even inviting me, which is the same thing I’ve had to experience with other groups of friends that I’ve had in the past. I was always an outcast, even among people I knew. I grew tired of their lack of consideration for me, so I stopped calling them. They weren’t even popular anyway, and I wasn’t benefitting at all from their friendship. I still continued to meet with Andy at restaurants on occasion, however. Every day that I spent at my college, the more inferior and invisible I felt. I felt like such an inferior mouse whenever I saw guys walking with beautiful girls. I hated having to endure it, but I had already worked so hard on my two classes that I couldn’t quit just then. The only way that I could gain a boost in to my self-esteem was to buy better looking clothes. My mother gave me a few more gift cards to Nordstrom, and I spent them on $200 dollar designer Jeans. When I wore these to school, I saw that I was wearing better Jeans than most other guys, and that made me have a slightly higher sense of self-worth. I also‎Elliot Rodger‎1
‎and innocent environment of childhood where everyone had an equal footing was all over. The time of fair play was at its end. Life is a competition and a struggle, and I was slowly starting to realize it. When I became aware of this common social structure at my school, I also started to examine myself and compare myself to these “cool kids”. I realized, with some horror, that I wasn’t “cool” at all. I had a dorky hairstyle, I wore plain and uncool clothing, and I was shy and unpopular. I was always described as the shy boy in the past, but I never really thought my shyness would affect me in a negative way, until this point. This revelation about the world, and about myself, really decreased my self-esteem. On top of this was the feeling that I was different because I am of mixed race. I am half White, half Asian, and this made me different from the normal fully-white kids that I was trying to fit in with. I envied the cool kids, and I wanted to be one of them. I was a bit frustrated at my parents for not shaping me into one of these kids in the past. They never made an effort to dress me in stylish clothing or get me a good-looking haircut. I had to make every effort to rectify this. I had to adapt. My first act was to ask my parents to allow me to bleach my hair blonde. I always envied and admired blonde-haired people, they always seemed so much more beautiful. My parents agreed to let me do it, and father took me to a hair salon on Mulholland Drive in Woodland Hills. Choosing that hair salon was a bad decision, for they only bleached the top of my head blonde. When I indignantly questioned why they didn’t make all of my hair blonde, they said that I was too young for a full bleaching. I was furious. I thought I looked so silly with blonde hair at the top of my head and black hair at the sides and back. I dreaded going to school the next day with this weird new hair. When I arrived at school the next day, I was intensely nervous. Before class started, I stood in a corner franticly trying to figure out how I would go about revealing this to everyone. Trevor was the first one to notice it, and he came up to me and patted my head, saying that it was very “cool”. Well, that was exactly what I wanted. My new hair turned out to be quite a spectacle, and for a few days I got a hint of the attention and admiration I so craved. My interest in Pokemon faded away at this time. In third grade, Pokemon was considered “cool” and everyone was playing it. Towards the end of fourth grade, I found out that everyone was growing out of Pokemon, and the only ones who played it were the geeky kids. I heard some‎Elliot Rodger‎1

‎garbage truck arrived, because the noise from the truck would mask any noise I make while leaving. The alarm, however, would definitely alert father and Soumaya. I got too nervous and abandoned that idea. Instead, I waited until everyone woke up and had breakfast. My plan was ruined by the alarm, and I had to come up with a new plan fast! I had little time left. I innocently told father I wanted to go on a small walk before the departure, and as soon as I exited the front door, I bolted at full speed. It was hasty, but I had to do something. I didn’t think father would catch on to my deception so quickly... After only clearing one block, I looked behind my shoulder and saw father chasing after me. All of my hope collapsed then and there, and I lost all of the fight in me. I stopped running and put my head down in defeat. Soumaya came in the car minutes later, and they both took me home. The plan failed. I was going to Morocco. The journey to Morocco was the most horrendous travel experience I’ve ever had. It was just me, Soumaya, and four-year-old Jazz. Jazz kept screaming and vomiting on the plane, Soumaya was in a sour mood, and I was completely miserable. I thought my whole life was all over. I had nothing to look forward to in the future. I wanted to die. Once I got there I felt like all of the life in me had drained out. I was so defeated. I couldn’t help but cry all the time, even in front of Soumaya’s relatives. Khadija didn’t understand why I was so upset, and she got offended that I was crying on the first day at her house. It was a complete disaster. I kept dreaming of home. I thought of the prospect of being able to return home, and a small hope sparked in me. I kept emailing my mother frequently, telling her how much I hated being there and how much I cried all the time. I told her that if she would give me one more chance and enable me to come home, I will try harder to lead a better life and become a person she could be proud of. After a week of doing this, mother gave in and flew to Morocco to take me home. I won. I was going home. When I returned to the U.S., I felt so relieved that I forgot about my troubles for a few days and relaxed. It was good to be back home. This is where my fight is, right here in the U.S., and nowhere else. The sense of elation I felt soon wore off. My lonely life as a social outcast resumed. I continued going on my usual long walks every day, feeling angry and hateful towards the world. During mother’s week, I would walk to the mall and sit on the balcony overlooking the food court next to the AMC theatres. There I‎Elliot Rodger‎1

I think that's my only class that I don't know anyone in. i have friends in my language class, and in my calculus class and in my psych class. i just don't kno anyone in my chem class. but hopefully that will change soon. oh today either my roomate's dad or my dad called today, but this guy that was in our room picked up the phone, and our partents are really strict about guys, so I hope I don't get in trouble. the guy who picked up the phone covered it up pretty well, but then we expected our parntets to call again, but no one ever called, so I kinda got worried, that they would think that we have guys in our room. oh well, I think I may be getting worried over nothinh. because they probably wont even say anyting, or even know. oh well. oh, I have a minute left in my writing assigment, so I guess that's it ‎stream of consciousness‎0

I have heard that people have weird dreams when they can't sort out all their problems during the day. I am really interested in why people have odd dreams and would like to further study the factors as well as reasons that cause these events. Whenever I have a dream, I hate the fact how I can never remember the following day, even though it's what wakes me up. Why is it that one can have a dream and after he awakens, he can no longer remember what or who was in it. I would really like to study the causes of our dreams and the reasons why we become so disturbed, yet can remember nothing. It would be interesting if someone did an experiment on students as a project; to detect and understand maybe the basis for having dreams. """‎stream of consciousness‎0

We went to a little store called oat willies it is  kind of a """"subculture"""" store. it has been around for a long time. they sell all  kinds of hippy novelties- pipes, inscense, books about drugs, and probably drugs  too if you know the right people. anyways my friend bought some sunglasses then  as we were walking back a friend from highschool came running out of baskin  robbins to say hi. I don't know her very well but she seems really nice. then we  went into this vintage clothes store. they had a lot of really soft comfortable  looking t-shirts. We both tried on a couple. then the guy that worked there  accused us of stealing a shirt which was really weird cause niether of us really  had anything that we could have hidden a shirt in. he found this hanger on the  rack that didn't have a shirt on it so I guess one of his shirts was missing and  I feel bad for him but it was still kind of insulting to be wrongly accused. Oh  well no big deal for me I guess. so I bought one t-shirt for three dollars and  we left. maybe his lost shirt will turn up somewhere. next we went to another  little store that sells interesting odds and ends.

I don't need coffee either but I think abbey thinks I'm mad at her so I'm going to go anyway and just study I guess. I mean I knew college was a lot of studying but I didn't think it'd be this much. maybe because I'm such a slow reader. I only read about 20 pages per hour. and in the textbook its only 10 per hour. its so slow and so many pages. I finally finished the psychology homework like 2 hours ago, it was sort of interesting but I hope the next chapters are better. I don't think I'm retaining anything. which is bad because I read for so long that you'd think I'd be learning it. I get psychology confused with philosophy and then can't seem to remember either of them. but in class I listen and I get it, then after I try to think about it and all my classes run together. yesterday was especially bad because I got my first grade on a calculus homework assignment. I made a 71 and it really pissed me off because I worked so hard and asked the teacher assistant for help but he gave me the wrong answer and I trusted it. he also didn't do some examples on the board correctly, which made me get another one wrong. today he was all ?oops? yeah it made me mad. but oh well I can drop it according to the syllabus that I don't have printed out. I hope whoever reads this does not think I'm a psycho or anything, or can't spell because its either a typo or I just don't spell well. I really am a good student though and I'm really sad about the calculus hw because it was my very first college grade and I have been waiting for all my hard work to pay off, and it sucked. I was in the bathroom at kerby lane and I cried when I told my dad, I always do that. its good that I have bangs now because if I were to cry or not pluck which I need to do, you can't tell that much. I'm funny about crying, I do it when something really touches my heart, which is kind of often I guess. but pain wise I'm pretty tough, I played basketball for so long. I'm so accident or injury prone.

I still have to go to my Rhetoric class. It's pretty boring too. I'm not a very good writer at all. I don't much enjoy going to class. I don't apply myself to school near as much as I should. I say I'm going to study but then I put it off until the last second. I guess there are a lot of people that do too. I'm pretty bad though. I don't study hardly at all and make B's and C's. I don't fell stupid for making sub par grades but I do feel stupid for not studying and trying. Then I could get all A's and B's. I'm a pretty laid back guy.

They can be idiots sometimes, but for the most part they're pretty cool. I have a girlfriend that I've been with for a year and a half. We don't fight very much. She gets mad at me a lot more than I get mad at her. She never use to get mad at me. But then a few weeks before I moved down to Austin she started.

I just realized I missed a club meeting tonight. I also remembered about the informal classes Ill be taking Monday. I should also be practicing guitar but I'm too lazy. (Homework for that matter)  Boy it's something else being 27 stories up. People look like small ants moving around in the strangest fashion. Now I don't even know what I'm saying anymore. I feel sick from the food I ate for dinner, and it's inhibiting me from my studies. What else to say. . . . . I remembered I should call Peggy since she left a message the other day, but that can wait till later. Oh, and Rob, well I need to inform him about the Houston concert info. I wonder if those airline tickets to D. C. came in yet. And where are those items I ordered from the catalog?  I'm beginning to worry. I cant believe B of A charges a dollar to merely check a statement from an ATM. They also charge for depositing and withdrawing currency from the bank teller instead of an ATM. outrageous. I'm really looking forward to go back home soon. I'm still homesick, but it's fizzled somewhat since the first few days. Looking at my bookshelf, it reminds that I bought Contact by Carl Sagan, which I keep intending to read, but never get around to it. I hate that. Why did I buy the book?  Well I thought Contact was an excellent movie for the moral implications that are brought up. It's a great thing to see such a science oriented film focus on faith and not mere facts. Carl Sagan must have been a brilliant man. My next door neighbors just turned up the stereo, so there goes the silence. Hmm what song is that?. Oh yeah, semi charmed life. I should look for those guitar tabs later. That reminds me, should go to the party next door on Sat. or not?  I suppose it couldn�t hurt, but then I'd get further behind on my studies.

‎ok i have been a little nervous about this assignment, not too nervous but a little. i'm kind of a quiet person so writing my thoughts for twenty minutes is a little intimidating. i don't really like how a lot of the stuff we do in psychology is over the internet. i guess it's convenient, but the internet messes up a lot. it is working today though. i just bought tickets for jimmy eat world over the internet. they are one of my favorite bands. my best friend, kristina, is coming up here to go to the concert with me. i miss her a lot! i need to clean my room. courtney, my roommate, has cleaned up a little. i don't think she cares too much that i am messy. she's messy too. she is from my hometown, so i knew her before we lived together here. we are getting really close. i'm glad we decided to live together. i'm glad i didn't wait til the last minute to do this assignment. i need to do my calculus and physics homework too. i also need to, well i don't need to but i want to go get a DVD called waking life. it is really good. it is a movie that makes me think because it questions reality. i like movies like that. i've been thinking about doing stuff with movies as a career, like visual arts type stuff, but that's only if i don't get into the architecture department. i need to take this psychology course because i will need to know how colors affect people's emotions if i am going to major in interior design. that really intrests me. i need to call kristina and tell her that i got the jimmy eat world tickets. she was at my friend jory's house the last time i talked to her. i miss jory a lot too. i haven't seen her in a long time. me and kristina and jory have been friends for a long time, since seventh grade. i miss them a lot. i need to call my friend cherry too. she lives in oklahoma because that's where she is going to college. i have about four minutes left. i hope this is the kind of stuff you wanted us to write. i guess it is because this is what i'm thinking about. i hope it doesn't matter that i didn't capitalize the word   i.  i never do even when i write unless it is in a paper i need to turn in for english class. my senior english teacher is a really nice lady. i really admire her. she is very encouraging. i miss her too. bye          ‎stream of consciousness‎0

‎"""Okay, I'm not quite sure what to write. I'm sitting in the undergraduate library right now because I can't get my computer at home to get internet access. It is a pain to have to have to come all the way down here to use the computer, but on the other hand it's good because while I'm here I'm going to study some other class materials. Maybe coming to the library will motivate me to keep up with my studies. It's ten minutes until 9pm on Sunday and I can't wait to go to bed! I just got done working out and I am already a little sore. I had a good day today, I did a little shopping this afternoon, and then I got to see my parents. They were driving through Austin on their way home, San Antonio, from Fort Worth. We went to dinner and got to visit for a little while. I was happy to see them, but a little sad because the reason they went to Fort Worth was to see my grandmother, my mom's mom. She has breast cancer and isn't doing as well as we'd like. She's especially nervous today because she starts radiation all over again tomorrow. It's kind of tough to think about this because my mind starts to wander and start asking thousands of """"what if"""" questions. What if she passes away? What is my grandfather going to do? How will my family survive? Luckily enough, my family is very close, so I know that everyone will find the support they need, but there is still no way to prepare yourself for these things. My mom says that she's more worried about how my two sisters and I are going to be when my grandfather on my dad's side passes. He's only 69 years old, but he has diabetes and doesn't take care of himself like he should. My body is weak right now, mainly from working out, but I can't help but notice that I feel like my body is """"sunken"""" since I started talking about death. You'd think that I would talk about something cheerful, especially since I am a pretty cheerful person. I guess I just need to talk about my fears for a while. Well, the rest of my life is going well. I transferred here from Texas Tech and I am adjusting to UT and Austin pretty well. I definitely miss my friends from Tech, but I can always visit them. I'm in an incredible relationship with my best friend. Mark and I have been together for close to two years now. It's an amazing thing to find true love. It's kind of scary to think that this is probably going to be the guy I spend the rest of my life with, but without a doubt I cannot wait to spend the rest of my life with him. I feel like just yesterday I was starting high school, and here I am in my second year of college. God has given me some incredible attributes.‎stream of consciousness‎0

‎"""You can't tell a person to write their feelings and expect that to show their thought processes. The awareness of the exercise takes away the naturalness of thought and the process of transcribing one's thoughts is inexact anyway. Well, I'm having difficulty doing it anyway. My apartment sucks. It's so modern. The clubhouse is littered with """"artistic"""" wrought-iron chairs and bright paint and triangular windows and shit. There's nothing artistic about that-- it means nothing to the creator and it's just used to entice """"hip"""" college kids to waste their money on these glossed-over crack house apartments. I'm not too upset about it though. I'm used to that sort of thing from corporate entities. The hard thing about these exercises is the difficulty of knowing the audience. It's not to the professor or the TA or my classmates or even to me because, I'm thinking it, why do I need to tell it to myself?  I write this and click the submit button and it travels into some ethereal world where it is represented to the prof / TA / whoever as an affirmative for social security number 465953267. Maybe that makes this more / less daring. I don't have to worry about you(whoever you are) reading it, and more importantly about myself going back and reading it tomorrow or in a week or a month or whenever. It makes it more daring because I can write anything and as soon as I click submit, it vanishes as far as anyone is concerned. Less daring in that I risk nothing. I'm wondering about the symbolic value of that word submit. I submit my thoughts. Earlier I was thinking about something. It was a little fragment of a story about existentialism in a Borgesian dream format. Maybe I'll develop that now. I dreamt last night that I was a mercenary in far away world where I had no vested interest in the goings-on. The denizens of said world were warring over things of grave importance. I posed the following question to myself: """"If I were to care about a side which would it be?""""  And so I picked a side and started fighting. Without fervor, without life-and-death importance, but with respect and a little curiosity. Not too bad. I'm not much of a writer. I guess as 20 minutes pass one begins to get used to the audience and just write. I'm out of ammo.   """‎stream of consciousness‎0

There are 3 rooms in my apartment and he chooses the one with my bed in it, which I am currently occupying and sleeping in order to turn on the lights and sign on the internet and read a book. When I inquired why he was doing this and let him know that I actually was trying to sleep at the time his only respeonse was,   No, it's cool man,   it's cool, I won't keep you up.

Soooo i guess i'll type for ANOTHER 20 mins to make sure i get the credit. Im not an overachiever either, but i might as well just type. We're going to light some candles in our room now. My roommate just said our room smells like shoes. . mmmmmmmm. Luckily though we bought tons of candles for our room to light and smell fresh(er). Thank goodness we knew eachother before moving in so we could plot out our room and make it sooo pretty! Alright i feel a headache coming. I think because im hungry. I ate, what. maybe 4 or 4 1/2 hours ago?? aaaaah im hungry!!! Morning seems so far away. Alright my roommate just reminded me of how frustrating it is that i just typed all that beforehand and have to do it again. thanks!!!! yes i am frustrated. stupid hand!! its because i type fast and don't pay attention to what im hitting so much. I just get sooo into this, haha. hey her vanilla candle smells better than mine. oh well mine looks prettier. Ok  i need a date book. I just started thinking about the football games and when im going to go. I want one of our good friends from Chicago to come in hte weekend of the A&M game. that would be fun for him. But problem. I think thats the day after Thanksgiving. The morning after actually. Shit. My friend Jess will be in Chicago until Saturday, and I know im going to Lubbock. . But i can always drive back in time thats no big deal at all. But what to do. Because Austin honesctly doesnt compare to CHicago. So i need something fun for him to do while hes here. I mean besides 6th street because he is a club freak. But its great, because hes so much fun to go out with!! And even better, he knows everybody either doormen or bartenders or owners or all of the above. So essentially he can get us in with no problem (not like theres much of a problem anyway being girls) because all the fun ones are 21 and over. Shhh don't tell my mom I told her i stopped going to them! She found out once because of jessicas crazy parents. oooh i can't stand that. But we still continued and had a jolly time. Everyone there knows us and that we're underage. Its great. really the chicago cops, the whole town is nuts.

My stomach keeps growling, but I am not sure if I want to eat because I feel as though I shouldn't eat because I want to lose weight although all my friends say that I am crazy for feeling this way. They keep telling me that I am perfectly fine the way I am. I still don't believe them because they don't see what I see in the mirror everyday. I've been told that I have a contorted way of looking at myself and that when I look in the mirror I see something different from what everyone else sees. But isn't that true for a lot of people?  Don't a lot of people see themselves in the mirror and not like what they see?  I think that it is perfectly normal to feel this way. What isn't normal though is acting upon it. Oh well. I can still hear the television and sometimes it distracts my thoughts because I begin to pay more attention to what is on the tv rather than my own thoughts. Now I want goldfish because I just heard the commercial. I can't think of what to type again. I think that this assignment causes us to think too much about what to type and that it puts us on the spot so that we freeze up and are no longer able to type what we think because we keep trying to type interesting things and not simply what is really on our minds. My room mate just laughed. I wonder why she laughed. I can hear the people out in the hallway. These walls are really thin because I can always hear what is going on outside. The refrigerator noise is really annoying. It's so loud. I feel sick still. I just want to go lay in my bed and sleep forever. I never get enough sleep. I always end up staying up really late and then I feel dead in the morning. My foot is falling asleep as well as my hands. I have the worst circulation in the world. Why is it that my feet and hands are constantly falling asleep no matter what position I put them in. I think it has to do with the fact that I don't get the proper nutrients. My hands are starting to get tired now. I can't wait until I am finished typing. I have about 2 minutes left and actually it wasn't really that hard to type for 20 minutes consecutively. I wonder how long everyone else's writing assingments are. I bet some of them will be longer than mine because a lot of people can type faster than I can. Oh well so much for that because it's too late now to start typing faster. I could try but then it would just seem pointless. My contacts are getting dry and it's getting hard to see the screen.

Right now I am thinking of a way to manage my time and get everything done. Right now I am hearing dead silence as my roommates and I are all studying in the same room. I am also hearing the fan and the doors slam from others people who are down the hall from me. Right now I am feeling very tired and my eyes are about to shut but I'm trying my best to stay awake. As I type, I'm thinking about other work that needs to be done by tomorrow and wondering if I'm ever going to get that done tonight. At this instant I'm noticing how  there are so many pictures of friends in front of me and how much I miss them. I'm wondering about how tomorrow's classes are going to be and what other will be assigned for that day. I am also thinking about how hard my classes are and how I am going to pass them. I'm trying to figure out a way to manage my time, a way to prevent me from procrastinate, and a way to stay in control with my study habits. Right now I also feel sad because I really miss my family. It's so hard for me to be away from them because I'm so close to them. I especially miss my little bother and little sister. They always make me laugh. Today my day was tough. I hardly understood what was going on in there so I had to stay after class and ask questions.

‎Crap, I was half way through this assignment and my computer just cut out or something. I really hope it didn't already submit because I don't want to screw up my credit for this paper. Great, now I'm completely paranoid that I've managed to screw up something so simple. I'll keep my fingers crossed. I need all the help I can get to do well in this class. Actually, I haven't worried about my grades in a long time. When tests start, I'll panic. It's really hard to focus in my morning classes during lectures. I never get enough rest. My schedule's all out of order. I can't fall asleep until around two or three and then have to wake up at seven. I'm tired all day long. I hear my TV and want to go watch it. I always put stuff off and watch too much television. I have a problem with procrastinating. I never used to be this bad. I'm scared that since I can't get on a study plan, I'll fail. I hate it when I over use a word when I'm writing. I feel like I haven't written enough, but does length matter?  My birthday is next week, which somewhat depresses me. I'm not close to any of my friends, and I'm scared they're going to forget about me. I feel like the only loser out of my friends who's not having this great college experience. It's not that I'm homesick, just kind of restless and bored. I haven't met that many people and frankly, feel like an outcast. My head hurts, but I have no tylenol. I hate swallowing pills. I used to break them up and put them in yogurt. I'm such a wuss. My roommate went home for the afternoon. I'm glad she is gone. She can be a little much with the extreme cleanliness. I went out of town one weekend, and she made my bed. I don't really want her invading my space and touching my things. ‎stream of consciousness‎0

‎"""This is the first writing assignment I have had in college. I'm a little nervous. I don't know why I should be worried about this because at least this writing assignment is an interesting one. I've never written in a stream of consciousness. I just lost my train of thought. I tend to do that. Actually, I constantly go off on these tangents as I hold any conversation. It's quite annoying. But hey, it's me. It's about to rain outside. I was just telling a friend about how hilarious it was that everyone noticed that it was raining when one student left early during class yesterday. And Professor Pennebaker was totally right when he said noone was paying attention anymore to what he was saying because we were all thinking, """"How the hell am I going to get home now?"""". I laughed for a long time after that, but I was still thinking about the rain. After I ran out of class I noticed a lot of people were prepared, and had their umbrellas with them. I also noticed that the people with these umbrellas who were walking with someone else without an umbrella, did not share their umbrella with the other person. Not one of them. I thought that was extremely odd. I have never used the word umbrella so many times in one sentence. I'm very sleepy now. The rain tends to have that effect on me. I love the rain, not just for that reason but it's also soothing. But I do hate when it rains right before, or when I am about to go out. It's a hassle that I haven't had to deal with for a long time. I'm thinking we are in the middle of a drought. I can't wait until winter either. That time of year makes me happy. I don't know why I keep referring to weather. I'm not one of those, """"It's lovely weather we are having today"""", kind of person. """‎stream of consciousness‎0

‎"""I'm going to be late, why did I schedule my classes so late in the day? I heard it was better to have later classes, but isn't 2pm for my first class a bit too late? It's too much trouble to change it, and oh my gosh! How am I supposed to concentrate in a room of about 500 people with my Microeconomics professor being so plain and boring. It reminds me of my U. S. History class junior year. it was crazy, I could barely stay awake. 2pm is generally when I take my afternoon nap as well, you know? Now it's twice as hard to stay awake in that class at that time. And today I've got a 12:30pm class, which I guess is a better time, don't you think? Yesterday I had a lot of time to spare before class, so I woke up early, and went to go work out, which worked out ok. I'm going to go workout to day as well. I'm going to try to work out as much as possible. you know how they talk about the freshman 15? That scares me. I mean I can see how freshmen can gain that weight. For example, I ended up skipping breakfast yesterday, and had a big lunch, which is more that I generally would eat for a lunch. SO I end up eating more than usual. But for dinner I had a sandwich and some cereal, so I think that was better. At home I just constantly snacked, which I heard is actually better than eating full meals. But at home, I actually had food lying around the house that I could just pick up at any time. IN my dorm, on the other hand, we've got ants, so I can't just have food out everywhere. And while others have a whole pantry full of food in their dorm, I've got a box of crackers, cereal, some soup, and fruit snacks. I haven't had milk in awhile, maybe I'll have milk for breakfast today. should I? Because if I do that then I won't really have a lunch, but breakfast for lunch you know? Uhh. I don't know, Everything is pretty new. This whole college lifestyle. Oh my gosh the first couple of days I was here I was really depressed. I didn't see very many of my friends, and the friends that I was seeing weren't my closest of friends. But we went over to one of my friend's dorms the other day, and just hung out and talked about old time. now that was fun. It's hard getting all together though, because everyone's got their own schedule and things to do. It'd be nice to get together again. One day at lunch I got together with a whole group of my friends, it was a lot of fun. better than just having a boring lunch with some friends that barely even talk. And my dorm room. I mean I like it, but when you compare to other peoples dorm rooms. oh my‎stream of consciousness‎0

‎I really don't know the first thing to say in this paper. I know I was confused about what to do, but there is really no confusion to it. is there? I don't know why I am talking to the computer like it is really going to talk back to me. Well, what am I thinking. I first want to know why it is so darn cold in all of these buildings, like I am about to freeze now in the computer lab at Kinsolving, and my roommate is talking to me about her boyfriend coming to see her today. Hell, I hate men right about now, because my man and I broke up a few weeks ago, before I came to school because he can't handle being in a serious relationship, that just happens to be long distance. I just don't know what the problem is. I mean if I am capable of being faithful, which has come pretty hard for me in the past, then I can be in a committed relationship. God, I need to get these nails off of my fingers because I keep messing up and having to backspace all the time. I think I'll get them soaked off tomorrow, after I get my navel pierced. I must seem like a really superficial person considering some of the things that are running through my mind. My fingers are starting to hurt because I am having to work extra hard because I have on these freaking nails. I just saw the number one in the tower on the computer screen that this boy just showed me. He looked so young, and he was actually kind of cute, but not tall enough. I know I just said that I hate men, but that was a lie. I can't live without them. Especially the tall ones that play basketball or run track or something. God, I want a man! I wonder how I would sound of I started talking all philosophical and stuff. I am not the type to go into deep analytical thinking, and I bet you are say, then why are you in my class. I think that the you are cool. I mean Prof. Pennebaker seems to be cool, but anyway. I am so bored right now, I have to braid this dude's hair, and I kind of don't want to, but he's going to pay me and I need some money, soon, and there is some back to school thing in the business atrium tonight.

‎Okay, I'm starting. I did assignments like this in freshman English back in high school. It was pretty cool. Mrs. Johnson was a great English teacher, but she scared me sometimes, like when she would yell at one of the kids in class to prove a point about what we were learning in class. I really liked that class. I liked the books we read. We were reading Huckleberry Finn, and one of her points she made was over censorship, she took the book away from us. We couldn't even go to the school library to finish it. I guess she got her point across. Another point she made was no matter how little time given for an assignment, you can get it done. Before we read Animal Farm, she split us up into groups, sheep, pigs, dogs, chicken, and we had to have a campaign. This just wasn't any campaign, we really had to work for it. Make up slogans, flyers, songs, costumes, bribes. you name, we were graded on it. We were allowed to decorate all the halls with our flyers. It became really big, Mrs. Johnson and her campaigns. It just kept getting bigger every year. I guess you could say the incoming freshman were getting crazier each year. I didn't really care, each year that went by was closer to me getting away from there. I can't stand it back home. I knew everybody in my school, and they all knew me, so tell my how I ended up with only a handful of people who would talk with me during lunch. I wasn't rude to people. least I don't think I was. Oh, well, I'll never see most of those people again in my life. Yippee! No, that's not the least bit sarcastic. I think sarcasm is a certain type of humor. Only certain people can do it, and only certain people think it's funny. I had to deal with sarcasm all the time in my family. I don't understand how some people say they come from a broken family. Your family doesn't necessarily have to be split up to feel like you've come from a dysfunctional family. I have to live with what my father does, and so does my mom and brother. Big deal, we make it through one day at a time. Like today, I just stopped worrying and went to a concert. It was pretty cool, although I wish I'd gone with someone who wanted to go up into the mosh pits. I know they're dangerous, but, come one, they're fun and you get to get close to the bands. I also went to a concert on Friday night. That one was cooler. The lead band was so cool. The singer was dancing around stage so crazily. It was a really neat experience for me. Only seven more minutes to go. No, I'm not counting. There goes that sarcasm again.

‎Right now i am simply writing and not feeling anything in particular. I am somewhat upset right now though because my throat is hurting, and this is due to the fact that i have started smoking a lot more than usual. I am a pretty sensitive person so i think that is why it hurts. who knows. I also am feeling a little unmotivated at the moment and i can't figure out why. This is the time in life when i am supposed to be super juiced to go out and get what i want, to grab life by the horns so to speak. This is not happening though, and it is kind of scary. Throughout my life i have been pretty much handed everything i have either through the mediocrity of others or through my own natural abilities, or a combination of both. It scares me to think that i have never applied myself fully to anything that i have ever done, and have still managed a somewhat successful, although underachieving, life. It makes me wonder a few things though about myself and what i have in store for the rest of my life. I don't know if i actually know how to apply myself fully to something, and if i do will i actually be able to stop and apply it to something else. This not only applies to me with work and school but also with personal relationships. Up to this point I have many friends, but very few whom i can actually call close friends. They are just there because of attrition or because i was what some people might call popular in high school. I wasn't popular because of my stunning personality though, but more of what i was;  a basketball player, an intelligent person, and somewhat goodlooking. When i got to college and found that there are hundreds if not thousands of people like this i found out that i am not at all who i thought. I don't really know who i am and who im not, and i am kind of scared to try to find out. When i finally decide what i am will i like it?  Will anyone else like me?  Will it make me happy or will i learn to hate myself because i disdain the person that i actually am. They say that you can be whoever you want but this is not true. You can TRY to be whoever you want but for some reason you cannot always be this way because there is something deep down inside of you that knows better. If i try to be a suave cool underpressure type guy, but fall down a lot, it doesn't really fit. I can want to be that way so badly, but it may never come true. If I accept that fact that i am a goofy dork will I like what that will get me.

I don't want to be there now, for no one is there friend wise really, but I just miss the security. I can't wait till I'm busier here at school. There is so much I want to do. There is a smudge on my computer screen, just enough that the words beneath it are  a little blurred. I wonder where the name Bevo came for the mascot of UT. Names are so funny. I mean who comes up with them. My name is strange and unique. People always ask me how I got it. I know it is derived from my grandfather's name, but I don't know how they logistically came up with it. Is Logistically a word. I doubt it . I'm always coming up with words like that.  I had the best weekend. It was a lot of fun. I got to spend some time with friends I hadn't seen in a while. I only wish it wasn't so rushed. We were constantly doing stuff. I just wanted to hang out and chill, but Oh no we had to party non-stop. I don't drink so I feel as if I'm not always that much fun. I know that is stupid. But that's how I feel.  Feelings are so weird they suck sometimes and are awesome other times. They are so demanding. I mean whatever you are feeling takes so much energy be it positive or negative. I feel lonely now. But I'm glad. I need to spend time with myself. but I'm the kind of person that can't stand being alone. That's something I'm going to have to work on.  I played soccer in high school. But I had surgery my senior year and couldn't play. I kinda want to play again, but I'm worried I'll suck since it has been so long. I cant believe I've used the word, """"suck"""" so many times that is so rude and un-lady like. excuse me. Well I don't even know who I'm apologizing to. I just know if my mother knew I used that word she would have a few words with me.  I just realized I need to flip my calendar. I can't believe it is already Sept. It seams like just yesterday summer was here. I'm not as good of a typist as I used to be, I keep hitting the wrong keys, or should I say striking the wrong keys.   Typing is a lot like playing the piano you strike keys in a planed out order‎stream of consciousness‎0
‎Right now I am tired, sleepy, and restless. Stressed about finishing work and school. I have a lot of work to get done before going to school. I want to get off to a good start this year and not fall behind. I need to finish this assingnment and get to others before school starts. I'm hungry and I need to make some food along with other things I need to do. I think I'll make a sandwich. I also need to take a shower before I go. I need to get my clothes out of the dryer so I have something to wear. I think I'll wear shorts today. I'll also wear a baseball cap. I want to pickup a cd on my way back from school today. Also need some groceries. I hope I don't have much homework tonight. Only a few more days until the weekend. I'm going to Houston this weekend, that will be fun. This is a three-day weekend. I'm looking forward to having three days off. I'll probably hang out with friends and go to a movie this weekend. Oh, yeah, Jared is back in town this week. I'll probably hang out with him this Friday, cause Saturday morning I have to go out of town. What is today?  Tuesday. That means I only have two classes today. That's pretty good, but the next two days are pretty long days, and then Friday is another short day. My 20 minutes is  almost up. I'm glad I got this writing assignment done and out of the way. Well, I guess that's it.  ‎stream of consciousness‎0
‎So I'm sitting here writing this thingy for psyche. I feel like a dork for getting this project done so early but I wanted to get it over with. It think it's funny that you, Prof. Penn, may read these and still have absolutely no idea who we are. It must be rough being a prof. in a big class like my PSY301. My mom is always reminding me that I didn't take it in high school and that's what I get for not taking it in high school. a giant class. It shouldn't be a horrible class though. I can't believe someone would paste something in this rather than just writing. I love writing. I've been writing a summer journal for the past 10 years and I love it. I'd love to write for a living but I just do the journal thing well. I could write a journal-type book, or a sex in the city type article. bah, there's no money in anything I want to do. listening to frank sonatra. he is very relaxing. come fly with me come fly let's fly away. ol blue eyes. man, this is going to be harder than I thought. it's only been 3 minutes and 59, 4 minutes, 4 minutes and 5 sec. ok I can't do that forever. what would happen if someone IMed me right now?  would I fail the assignment because I stopped writing?  I should have turned it off. yuck. I just burped. ew, I just wrote that I just burped. see, I had spaghetti for lunch and I can still taste it because the food sucks. I miss home all ready. I feel like a dork because I miss home, and I want to go home every weekend. I need to be social. I need to get out and met more people. there's so much pressure on college to be great because high school blew for me. my head itches. bleh. bleh, what to say what to say. my arm hurts now and it's only been 6 minutes and 11 sec, 24, 16. ok I'll stop for real now. I am a dork for doing my writing assignment so early, aren't I?  I guess no one will know. why do I even care?  I keep switching in and out of I and I. capitals that is. I never do capitals when I'm typing on AIM so why should I do it now. I don't think it capital letters. !  well well well. this better go through. the testing. pre testing that is, doesn't work yet. I hope this works because I don't have a printer that will verify that I actually did the assignment. yea for being a poor college student. actually, I live in san jac and I had no idea that everyone thought this is where the snobs live, geez. genevieve just got on. I wouldn't talk to her even if I wasn't doing this thing. ah, sharp pains in my arm. that's so weird!  I guess it's‎stream of consciousness‎0
‎I miss everyone so much, and I can't believe that I care about him so much, as a person, as a friend. its scary. its like the whole robby thing. robby. I wonder how he is. I can't believe he had a girlfriend. I wonder if he still does. he was such a great guy, he still is I'm sure. he thinks he has to define himself now by drugs or smoking or horrible music. I'm not understanding that. I wonder if wonkie is doing the same thing? I can't believe she would smoke. I bet she couldn't believe I would drink. why does armando think I would give it up to will. I may like the guy, but that doesn't mean I want to jump in a bed with him. I hope he was just kidding. I wonder why robby went off the deep end and pushed everyone away. I hope that doesn't happen to will, I hope he doesn't push me away. if he pushes me away, he has arthur left, and russ, but he will push russ too I'm sure if he pushes me. I hope that arthur falls off a cliff and breaks both his legs and arms, and has to leave UTSA so that he doesn't ruin will. I hope that he doesn't kill him. it made me almost cry when russ was kidding about that. it makes me so worried when he says he doesn't mind getting into a car with drunk arthur. I know he knows its wrong. does he think trying to validate it to me will make it ok? what would I do if he died and I was the last one to talk to him, and I knew he got in a car with a drunk arthur? I would feel guilty. but there's nothing I could do about it. I couldn't stop him. there's no way. he is making decisions on his own now. well I don't think he is doing a very good job of it. why does he tell ppl that he got high or drunk and decided to go to utsa? I know he remembers that it was me saying he should go for it. I convinced him to go there, like he convinced me to go here, and now we're both not happy. I think I handle it better. I don't know that running away to san antonio to see him/everyone is better, but at least I'm not screwing things up by being drunk all the time and fo ‎stream of consciousness‎0

I especially enjoy the way they manipulate the texture of the music. its panned all different kinds of ways to where if you're listening to it in a portable cd player or anything that has a distinct sound system you can notice all these minute details that they have injected in there. any other way would require you to have incredibly sharp hearing sense. I can't believe I have a kitten now. my mom told me to take care of it and get a job to support it. I just laughed at that. is it getting hot in here? I swear. one second I'm cold and the next I'm burning up. and for some reason I'm having a hard time typing right now. I think its because of the temperature. that and lack of knowledge of what to say. my cat is crawling up my leg and meowing right now. I wonder what it is that she wants. I wonder why the mars volta decided to say now I'm lost"""" as the most definitive part of the chorus. its pretty great anyways. aww. the cat wants to snuggle in my lap. too cute. I'm going to have to do so much reading tonight. sheish. so many classes and concepts to keep up with. something smells like kitty litter. uggg. kitten. she needs to stop biting me. ahh. she is going to tear my sweater. that is my favorite sweater! I've been everywhere and through everything in this black sweater. I started out with it during my emo days of high school and then grew up wearing it. good times and bad, I've worn this sweater. man. I can't wait until I have my interview with saul williams. its going to be so rad. I can't wait to do research on him so that I can know about every little detail to talk about. hold on. I need to take the sweater off. great. right when I decide to do that the air conditioning decides to come on. just my luck, it always works out this way. I wonder if I could ever get my poetry published. it would be amazing to claim that I wrote a book or compiled just a whole bunch of all the poetry I've written. sometimes I get paranoid that someone's going to copy and steal it since I have it online. not a good idea rola. boy I really like this song. I wish I could write songs this amazing.

There are so many times when I am just sitting here playing on the computer and doing nothing really, and no one wants to talk. The minute I start doing something productive, there is like five people trying to talk to me at once. All that typing and its only been two minutes. I have no idea what to type. Can your mind really go blank?  I mean, I want to use the expression right now, my mind is blank, because I'm not really thinking about anything, but obviously I'm thinking about something because I am typing this stuff. So my mind really isn't blank then. So I guess your mind doesn't really ever go blank. My roommate is funny. I keep picturing her when I walked in the door from class earlier. She was asleep on the couch but she had the pillow on her face. How someone can sleep with a pillow on their face is beyond me. Its looked so funny though. I should have took a picture. I'm really sleepy already and its only going to be seven o'clock in the evening. I am still not used to this getting up early for class stuff. Ah. The new real world is on tonight. I absolutely love watching that show. All the drama. Its interesting to watch. Its kind of sad though I think, the way people love to watch reality shows. I mean, they are not really a true picture of reality. They film for hours and hours and hours, but the show itself is usually only a half hour episode, and they usually only run for a few months, once a week. Can u imagine how much film ends up on the """"cutting room floor"""" as they call it. All the drama and stuff is pretty much made up by producers if you think about it. If not made up completely at least embellished. And its all because of editing. Birthday. Someone on TV just said the word birthday. I'm so excited. My birthday is a week from tomorrow. Yeah!  but I also have my dad's birthday next week and my boyfriend's too. And I have no idea what to get them. Actually what to get my boyfriend. My dad is easy.

I feel like this is some type of race, like a time trial or a running race in which I have 20 minutes to run as far as possible and must finish strong. This writing is not so painful as I though because I was sure that I would just go braindead and have nothing to say. I do have a lot to say but it might not be the most earth shattering writing.

The lights just came on. I'm so relieved because now I can feel the air conditioning. I'm a little bit off the assignment because Cara is watching me. Cara says hi. she is really sick right now and her nose is always runny. she snotted on my bed. or maybe she just drooled. I don't really know. Tonight I need to go to the theta house and study. We have to get certain amount of hours done . I don't really want to read anymore of the Great Plains by Webb. It is like a history book. It  makes me want to fall asleep sometimes when I read it. The most interesting section was about the animals on the Plains. The little jackrabbit has a white patch on its butt so that whenever it is in danger or something it flares it up to communicate with it's own kind. I guess that's how it works. Right now it's talking about the north vs. the south and it is way boring. I have about 70 pages  to read tonight. It is a little overwhelming. sometimes I get behind  and feel real guilty about it because I want to keep up with all my classes. I need to do my math homework too. I kind of just feel like taking a nap until we go study but then I'll never get up. My bed is sooooooo  cozy. I just put on some pink sheets and they rock because they are soo soft. I kind of feel like watching Backdraft. Whichever Baldwin guy is in it is really good looking. He reminds me of this Stratford guy that is living in  towers. He is really good looking obviously and really sweet too. He walked us home the other night from the KA house because he thought it was too dangerous. then he started talking about what church he went to. I was thinking this guy is too good to be true. But then someone told me that he had just broken up with his long time girlfriend because they are at separate colleges. I don't think I would like to get in the middle of that. If that's the only reason why they broke up then that's not enough. Because obviously they had something big to hold onto and not let go of just like that. But he is one of the better guys  I've seen around lately. I kind of want to just ver out tonight but I know that I'll feel bad about it later.

‎     I've been thinking about relationships lately. As we speak my mind is bewildered with thoughts of my ex-girlfriend that i was with for over a year, and the new girl im dating. Im still friends with my ex, but she still loves me and im not in love with her any longer. This new girl means the world to me, she is a nice change of pace for me. It's something new and I like it, but I can't help but still have feelings for my ex. I think the reason is because I was in a sexual relationship with her for a year, my first sexual partner. And I think that keeps me tied to her in a way. And the problem is when I'm with this new girl, I'm very turned on and want to be with her sexually but for some reason I can not get aroused, if you nkow what I mean. It's not that I don't want to, because I do, but for some reason I'm just not able to. I wonder why this is? Why can't I just have another healthy sexual relationship with this new girl. Is it me? What can I do to fix the problem? Should I just stop thinking about it and eventually it will pass over time? Or will this be a chronic thing? Im in a bind because I don't want to offend this new girl by not getting aroused with her. I don't want her to think I'm not attracted to her. God, I can't wait to see her! She lives in Dallas still, she's a year younger, so I can only go back in town on occasion to see her, and what makes it even worse is the temptation from my ex, because she goes to college here with me. And she has already taken advantage of me when I was drunk. Should I tell this new girl this? What good would it do? I'm not going to volunteer the information to her, but if she asked me I definitley wouldn't lie to her. When I broke up with my ex I wanted to be free, I mean I was going to college and I wanted to see what possibilities there were for me without the weight of a girl friend on my back. But then just a week after we broke up, I found her!! And she makes me want to go back to a relationship state. She likes me how I am, but I like to try and impress her as much as I can. I find myself spending  a lot of moeny on her! Plus, I'm taking a weight lifting class here to make myself look better, not just for her, but myself too, but I definitley want it for her because I know she would like to see me with more muscles. She's so beautiful! Her face pops up in my head everyday. I see her face on everyone I meet! Am I in love again? I‎stream of consciousness‎0

‎"""I am so mad right now. I have tried so many times to go to the Internet site for this class, and it says error. The URL. I am upset. This thing is due Friday. So now I'm in word, waiting for the stupid site to be fixed. I just got off the phone and the conversation made no sense. There was a party in the town I am from, and some guy got stabbed and died. He was 35 and from San Antonio. The weird thing is that no one knows who stabbed him. Now to me this makes no sense. They were at a PARTY. There are usually people everywhere. Oh well. I have a lot of stuff to do. Me and Allison are going apartment hunting tomorrow. It's weird, I've only known her since I moved here in August, and already we are good friends and plan on living together next year. We want to live at Orange Tree because it's cute. I looked on the Internet for some info on it, and there is none. I think it is stupid that we have to go apartment shopping in September for a place we won't move into for almost a year. Oh well, we are doing it now so we don't get screwed. I was just talking to Corey, my cute boyfriend, and I was telling him about the pleasure center in mice and how different it was from humans. I always tell him what I've learned in class because it helps me remember it. I feel sorry for him, I wouldn't want to hear it if I were him. He's so nice like that. I ordered cookies last night from Tiffany's Treats, they deliver freshly cooked cookies to your door. Anyway, I was in a friend's room at Hardin Housewhich I hate and we were talking about boyfriends and stuff. I told them I want to get married on November 19, 2005 to Corey. They laughed and asked why, so I told them. We've actually talked about marriage, and we both love each other that much, so it's cool. We want to live together in a couple of years. Actually he is going to live near us at Orange Tree if at all possible. He has a brother who is a year younger, Codey, who is a pothead. He has a girlfriend Amy, who I don't like. She's only a freshman in high school, but she doesn't belong with him. Corey and Codey are total opposites. I have a lot of work to do. Tonight I have to do calculus, read for my freshman seminar, and do my Italian work. I got a quiz back today from that class, and I got a 75. I was so upset. I'm used to A's. Italian is not a required course for my major, so I was wondering if I could take it pass/fail. That would be good, then it couldn't bring down my GPA. I need to ask some one about that. I hate my roommate and suitemate. They‎stream of consciousness‎0

‎I have read for classes almost all day. I can't concentrate on anything that I start to do. I will read a couple of pages, and then I will take a break, or I will do something else. I don't want to get behind, but I just am not motivated at all. I want to have all my reading done for my classes before I go to them. Everyone tells me that it will help me to understand the lectures. I don't want to be catching up all week. I want to try to get my reading assignments for next week done before I go home for Labor Day. I am excited about going home on Thursday. I don't want to have to read anything while I am there. I have not seen my friends for almost three weeks, and I will finally get to see them, not just talk to them on the phone. I don't really talk that long to people in the phone. I have only talked to my best friend three times in the two weeks that I have been here. I feel like I have been in Austin forever. I came to school early for Rush. Sometimes I wish I would not have gone through Rush. I did not get into my first choice sorority, but I got into one with really nice girls. I don't know whether this is something that I want to do anymore. I don't even know if I can get out of it. I just can't wait to go home where life is normal. I just want things to be like they have been all of my life. In the past two weeks, my whole life was turned upside down. I don't feel like I have to stay here. I feel like in the next few weeks this will all be over and I will go back home where I have always been. I do enjoy my classes. Right now, they do not seem to hard,  but I am sure they will get much harder. I only know one person (at the most) in my classes. I feel like I do not have any friends. I meet all kinds of different people, but I would not consider them my friends. Even some of my high school friends are not my friends any more. My best friend all through high school is the only person that I still talk to. I dated my other best friend during high school, and we were finally becoming friends again after breaking up, and then it was time to leave. Now, I find out that he was lying to me about almost everything. I don't understand why he could not tell me the truth. It is not like I care who he dates, but it would be nice to hear it from him, and not from other people. I don't know about other people. All this makes me question all the people who I thought were my friends. I just feel like everything is spinning‎stream of consciousness‎0

‎"""I believe in the future of agriculture, with a faith born not of words, but of deeds. Better days through better ways. That's all of the Creed to the FFA I can rememeber, although I had to recite it for many times. I feel somewhat out of place in my apartment with 4 other room mates because I pay the least rent but I have the most disposable income. I'm not sure if I spell a lot of words incorrectly because I'm dyslexic. I will say that by typing, my spelling improves. My hand writing is horrible. I can bearly read the things I write. I've worked out deals with most all of my teachers in the past about letting me take assignments home and write them. Man, this room is hot. I just turned on the fan but it's still way too hot. I want to take guitar and speed reading classes. Those are two areas of my life in which I think I drastically need improvement. Although, none of which are pertinent to my life right now. I supose the speed reading class might be. I'm so far behind in my readings for all my classes, I don't want to start. Twenty minutes is a long time to write about nothing. I wonder how many books have started, or been intirely written with not forthought what so ever going into the plot. I had a dream I thought should be a book the other night, but I can't remember it. My memmory has been getting worse daily. Not just because of the alcohol consumption. I think I'm acutally drinking less now than I did in high school. I'm feeling an excess load of self inflicted stress lately, and I think it should get a little worse in the next coulpe days and then a lot better. My girl friend of over a year and a half and I broke up a couple weeks ago, but continued to date. The part that bothers me is that I don't have the same free time as she does, so all my free time still goes to her, but she's dating other people. I told her today that I wanted to sever ties for 3 weeks and see how that goes. She's totally against it, and if I were her, I would be too. She still has the comanionship of her 1st and longest boyfriend, and can date other people on the side. One of which is the same age as my 23 year old brother who is a huge reason we broke up in the first place. I feel this pain inside me I've never felt before when I hear her talking about going places with him. But like my roommate says, there's nothing like a good jam secion. He's talking about music, but I want to jam with some other girls. Get my mind off of her. I know that the migranes and headaches are from her, and that she really is being selfish most of the time, and she's not‎stream of consciousness‎0

‎I have a horrible headache and I don't want to read for my other classes. My mind keeps wandering off into the conversations on the television. My head itches, so I am going to scratch it. I thing I am going to enjoy the business council . I am glad that I got on it I need to be on a organization. I wan to go to Cancun this spring break but my boyfriend wants me to meet his family in Chicago. I really would  rather go to the beach. I am listening to the television again, even though  it's in the other room, and I hate guys who date strippers and then they tell the girls to get out of it. Hey if you liked her as a stripper before then you need to like her the way she is. I am upset that I am missed the MTV music awards because I love music, if I could anything I wanted to I would quite school and pursue a career in the music business, even though it is so saturated. I just noticed that Victoria's Secret is having a huge sale on pajamas, I could really use some. I am noticing that my mind is shifting every direction. It is difficult to write about nothing and stay on a particular topic. If you gave me something to write about I would be able to concentrate, or maybe I just don't realize that my mind wanders so much. Isn't it like every three seconds. Oh this weekend was so cool I went to a foam party and I had a blast. I was up to my face in foam last night. I have never been to one of those before in my life. I probably would go again too. Because everyone was really mellow and just having a good time. Do Do, I am now singing a song in my head and kind of dancing. I was fascinated at dinner today because my roommate's father was telling all about his experiences with scorpions when her was a boy. I was pretty freaked out the whole way home. I kept feeling like something was crawling all over me. It was weird. I am so bored now, You said to be honest so sorry. I want to go shopping for some new winter clothes that always feels really good, I get so excited when I buy stuff and I look good. Well I need to workout first because I have become a little bit more flabby than I would like to be. My eyes are going blurry maybe I need glasses or else I am really tired. ‎stream of consciousness‎0

‎seems as if everyone is dying. isn't that sad?  I just found out that an acquaintance of mines is pregnant again. I don't know how to feel. this isn't her first pregnancy and she should know better. what is this world coming to?  my cousin is going through a break up right now and I don't know what I can do to help. I know she can do better than him, but I also know that she likes him a lot. What's a girl to do?  I am really relieved that I don't have a boyfriend anymore, yet why am I still commenting on that?  I was a lot better before he called. I just wish he could disappear and I don't know. he really needs to straighten out his life. you know what the funny thing is?  I think that the bad guys are the guys that like you more. it may not be true, but when it is, it is. let my rephrase that. when a guy that's on the wrong side falls (for you), they fall hard. I don't know if anyone has fallen for me yet. it is midnight and I still have other things to do. thank goodness I remembered about this. I actually don't mind typing like this. this is just like one of my journal pages that I try to do at least twice a week. I really believe that it serves as a stress reliever and should be done more often. well it's been 35 minutes so I�m outta here. lan ngoc ngo       ‎stream of consciousness‎0

‎Right now I am feeling very stressed out with all of the work and reading that my professors have given me. In my Language of the Stage class my teacher gave my about 60 pages to read and take notes from and we have to discuss the reading this Friday. It has alredy taken me a good long while to take notes on the first 17 pages. I don't know how I am going to read the rest. I am almost thinking that I should just not do it but if I did that I would feel very guilty about myself for not doing it. So I think that I am going to be pulling an all nighter trying to finish reading and taking noes on the materials. I just think that the work he put on us is a little harsh. That is a lot of work. Now my best friend from home was going to come stay with me one night this weekend. I was so excited because I haven't seen her since we both left for school, but now she is not coming but all of her friends that go to school with her now are going to come. I am so upset because I really wanted to see her. She is going back home to see her family instead. I know that she wanted to come stay with me but she just couldn't but I really wanted her here because I know that we would have had so much fun together and I wanted her to meet all of my friends. Oh well, I know that she will come to see me soon I hope. Well so far I have had a really good time here at school. I have become friends with a lot of cool people and my sister is here also. The only problem is that I have been going ouit almost every single night and it is really wearing me down. It's like I wnat to make good grades in school but I also want to go out and meet new people. I am also a Pi Phi here and so there is always something we have to do during the week. I really need to cut back on going out all the time and try to get some good sleep. I also need to start working out again because I don't want to gain weight and I am really afraid about that. I also want to work out just so that I feel good about myself and feel like I have done something productive for the day. I hate feeling like a slob and that is what I have felt like lately. Well I am having so much fun but I really miss my friends that aren't here. Only a couple of my friends are here but I enjoy meeting new people and getting to know everyone even though it can be hard when you don't know many people already. ‎stream of consciousness‎0

‎My main thoughts right now consist of music. I am thinking of a new song that I wrote about my thoughts on the people that I have seen at UT. Music I feel is the greatest thing in the world because I get to release all my emotions through a song. I think most people do not understand music or in that same since the love for sound and melody. These reasons have helped me to conclude why people like bad music like boy bands. Surely anybody with any amount of intelligence could see that these bands or groups, have no talent except that they can sing other peoples songs. I don't believe any of them write their own songs, so I can't see why people would think they are talented. This brings me to something else I do not like about people, they are generally fake. What I mean by this is that they do everything to impress others and not them selves. For example, people try to fit in with a crowd by wearing certain types of clothes and name brands of everything. This things I do not do and hopefully never will. I feel that people really do not know what they want or even how to get to where they do know. I thought by coming to UT that I would see less of this type of attitude from people but I now know that this is not the case and people are like that everywhere go in life. From this point I would like to say that UT is great(except for parking)and that I do like more people here then I did in high school. I am not sure what I want to do with the education I am receiving from this school but I hope that very soon I will recognize my calling in life. ‎stream of consciousness‎0

‎This past weekend I took a short journey back to my home city of San Antonio, Texas. I went there to get some more items from my house, and as you can tell I'm still in the process of moving in all of my belongings into my dorm. The dorm itself I like very much because it is a good enough distance from the university itself so that I can feel as though I am actually going home each day after classes; plus the food here is excellent. This semester so far has been going by a little slow just as the first few weeks of every school year do. However, last week was very satisfying due to the fact that I got much accomplished. I got much of my studying done and I finally got my book situation in order. At first when I went to the Co-op I bought all these different books for each of the classes I am taking and then I came to discover that I didn't need about three of them. So then I had to make time to go back and return the books that I no longer needed, and I had the pleasure of standing in the horrendous line it seemed they formed just for me. This weekend I also went to the football game to see my favorite team in the land play a not-so-good team, but I still managed to have a great time. I bought two tickets for my brother and my best friend who came in to visit me. The day after the game when I went back to San Antonio I got to visit with my baby brother who is now about seven months old. He is beginning to talk and make little noises that babies make. I was a little sad to leave him so soon after his birth, but I will see him every now and then when I get a chance to journey back home. I also got to spend time with my girlfriend of about two years. We went out to eat and to see a movie. We weren't sure what movie to see so I thought I would let her pick because of the nice that I am, and she - being the girl that she is - picked wicker park which is a story about this guy who falls in love with a girl two years ago and he sees her walking down the street. He immediately bolts out the door of the shoe store he is standing in and tries to catch her, but his friend stops him to talk and he loses her, but to make a long story short he gets sidetracked bye this psycho girl who falls in love with him and is trying to keep him away from the girl who he originally wanted. In the end he finally gets to talk to the first girl and they are happy as can be. I can't wait for winter time. It is definitely one of my favorite times‎stream of consciousness‎0

But I'll definitely need to leave in around thirty. that boy Michael was really cute. really cute. he is the first nice looking Mexican that I have seen yet. Ok maybe there were a few others but he lives on my floor and he introduced himself. that's one of the things I don't like about this school. no one introduces themselves to each other. it's like everyone only cares about their own lives and won't be bothered by anyone else's. but you know what. I think everyone else wants to meet people too, at least the majority but they just don't know how to go about doing it so they act like they don't care and disinterested or they act like they are much too busy and much too good for anyone else. it's very sad I think. at the beginning everyone is all excited, expecting other people to be really nice and friendly and then they meet the first bitchy person. Now they realize how things work around here and in an effort not to get thwarted and rejected by another person, they too take on the same attitude and on goes the downward spiral. just because we all fear a little bit of rejection. Sad really. that was my friend matt from economics class. He's not really my friend but I sit next to him in class. he seems nice enough and he is going to let me borrow his econ book since mine has not come in the mail yet. I'm going to be so behind in economics. I tell you. I really like that class though. so anyways. I know how this goes because I thought everyone would be nice and friendly but I was met with blank stares when I smiled at anyone anywhere on campus with the exception of a few. A very few. whatever. I am still going to smile and I am still going to introduce myself and be nice because otherwise I will be miserable and unapproachable like those people. ugh. I just put """"so anyways"""" instead of """"so anyway"""" I think that sounds as dumb as """"laters"""" when one really means """"later"""". that is really very jr. high. I miss those days. I wonder how Cindy is doing. ugh. I really don't want to go to the convocation because everyone is just going to be with their own little group and I will be an outcast once again. I'm pretty and nice and outgoing and popular and smart. Damn that sounds really conceited. Maybe I'm a little of that too. I considered erasing a couple of those adjectives but I think that's pretty dumb considering I really do think those things about myself. it's not socially acceptable to think good things about yourself. It's much more appealing to not know any of the good things about oneself. I confess that I too am attracted to ignorance of ones own worth and humility and modesty.

The problem with that is, i just know too many people here, so there's always someone to hang out with, we just don't get new people to hang out with. and it's also kind of pointless if you sit down and think about it. because the odds are, if you see someone somewhere and introduce yourself to them, you very well may never even see them again. I mean, how much does that suck. ooh this is my favorite part of the song. shine on you crazy diamonds. wow, that just made me think of band banquet from last year and i have absolutely no idea why. unless it's because my date was wearing a gold sequine dress and was definitely shining. yeah, that's prolly it. oh lord my hands are tired. i'm so out of shape. i've definitely lost like 20 pounds of muscle over the summer. and now, everyone here is huge. i was big back in high school, but comparatively, i'm a stinkin shrimp. and i really don't have any particular skill at any sport. i played soccer in high school, but i played goalie and i hate it now. i'm average at any sport but i don't really excel at anything in particular so i'm at a decided disadvantage. ‎stream of consciousness‎0

‎"""I do not know what to write about for twenty minutes. It took me so long to get a computer at this place, and I would like to E-mail my best friend in Arizona since I never get to see her. Well, I guess this is the coolest assignment that I have had so far since it doesn't require any thinking- well, it actually does. in fact, that's all this assignment is about. But, I mean it is not hard. I am really worried about my classes this semester. I feel like I have been going to school here for a while, but it has only been a week. I have a lot of reading to do. I think my classes are not too hard, but I KNOW THAT THEY WILL GET HARDER, I JUST HOPE THAT I DO WELL. Oops, I just turned the caps lock key, sorry!  Well, I am now thinking about what I should eat for dinner. I am also thinking that I don't want to gain the freshman-15. I eat pretty healthy food in the cafeteria, but I eat a lot more than I did at home. but I guess since all of my classes are miles away from each other, I will be OK. My boyfriend is coming to see me sometime soon, I wish that he was here right now. I hope that he is doing OK because I wonder about him. He's always changing his mind about our whole relationship- whether he thinks it will work out or not. One minute, he is all for it, and another, he thinks it will never work because we are too far away from each other. Anyway, all I know is that I really care about him, and that I have to leave the rest up to God to figure out. I feel really exhausted right now because I only got 6 hours of sleep last night, and then I woke up and went to class after a cup of coffee, something I think I'll have to get used to drinking now that I am here. that's one thing I really miss about College Station, though (even though there can't possibly be that much to miss in a town like that except for the people)  I miss the Java shakes I used to get at Sweet Eugene's, this coffee house I love so much. I thought that by coming to Austin, I would surely find a replacement for the Java shake, with all of the many coffee houses here, but I have yet to find something to beat it. Although I did find this shake called a """"Skinny Banana Espresso Shake"""" at a coffee house on the drag called Metro. My really good friend Maria and I go there every Friday now to get one- it's like one of our new little Austin rituals, so we can make sure to stay close by seeing each other once in a while, and making an outing of it. It's really weird though how people you least‎stream of consciousness‎0
‎     Well I finally found the website for this place, and now Im not really sure what to say. Im sitting at my desk, and my room seems really warm. Im also very angry at my roommate Katie right now. Sometimes she just isnt very considerate of other peoples feelings. I signed up for an experiment thing in my CSD class, and I have no idea where the room is! All it said was Totten and the time and I have no idea what that means. I hope my teacher explains it closer to the time. Oh I also have to sign up for the experiment for this class too. I almost forgot! The ink on my hand is already wearing off, I should go write down the time on paper when Im done with this. I really like the class though, except my teacher is boring. But its cool because I want to major in communications. The lady from there never called me back! I should call her again soon. Well maybe I can get the application online or something. I wonder whats going on with the guys next door. They're always coming over here to say hi. I think Im going to ask Vinay if he wants to do his calculus homework with me! Hes pretty smart, and maybe he can help me. Poor Kris. I can't believe hes sick now because of me! I hope hes feeling better. This chair is really nice! Yesterday was pretty scary, I get really nervous about stuff like that. The bells at the Tower were really pretty though when they were playing God Bless America. I guess its a pretty historical moment, and Im glad I was here for that. Even though this wasnt my first choice I guess its ok. Its kind of big, but maybe I need that. Wow its been 8 minutes already. I don't know if this is due by 5 today. wait what is today. Ok I ha 3 classes so its Thursday and oh ok Sept 13. Thats tomorrow. This is crazy. I should get started on that map too. I wonder who will be analyzing this, or if it even gets analyzed. Yeah I bet it does. Why else would I be writing it. I think it said it was going to give me a printout of what I wrote and something else too. an analysis? I don't think a computer could do that. Wow tomorrow is friday already yay I get to see all my friends back home! I have to go see Peter and see how Forbidden Gardens is! He said hes still going to work there until the end of the year I think. I wonder what college he'll end up going to. He could get into Princeton, I hope he does. If not hs coming to UT so that'll be cool. Uh I can't believe this morning! Im so mad at her! I wonder when shes getting back! Should I act mad or just let it go?‎stream of consciousness‎0

‎sort of empty without it. It was such a big part of my life for so long. I think I'm going to attempt to walk on next year to the UT soccer team. It's really hard to do that though. The team is extremely competative. Though, I think after I talk to my coaches back home, maybe they can help. My main concern at the moment is doing well in school. I really need to buckle down and study. I study everyday, but I need to do it more I think. Maybe I'm just stressing about my upcoming tests. I'm scared about my chemistry test. Though, I think with the right amount memorization of some problems along with some other material, that I'll be fine. I need to start preparing for my biology test tomorrow. The test is Thursday, so I have 2 days to get in all the information. I feel tired right now. I wish I had came back to Austin earlier so I would've started on my work earlier. Well, tomorrow's another day, so I guess I'll just do a lot of studying tomorrow. There's no sense in doing it right this second when I'm not feeling to good and when I'm tired. My main priority is studying for my biology test Thursday. I need to go over the old exam she gave to us. My boyfriend just called me, but I had to tell him that I would call him back so I could finish this writing assignment. I really hope I do well on my test Thursday. If I did well, I would be so happy. That would mean that I actually liked my major and that I could retain the information pertaining to it. I want to call my boyfriend back after this, but my roommate """"can't consontrait"""" with my talking, so I guess I'll go outside. Though, she's talked many a times with her boyfriend while I was reading. Oh well, maybe I'm a little more respectful. """‎stream of consciousness‎0

I've known that God has someone special picked out for me, but i never thought of actually backing off and letting God bring him to me. i know He will, but it's hard to not be looking for that someone. yeah. . still a little rusty on the subject - that's why i should actually FINISH THE BOOK! :)  and that's another thing- i have NOT been keeping up with my quiet times recently!  not just recently. it's been quite some time. i want to but there's just not that constant desire you know?  it's something that i need to be praying about. there are lots of things i need to be praying about, such as continued enthusiasm for my studies at ut. i am so excited about all of my classes!  they are ALL soooo amazingly interesting to me, and i hope i just don't get burnt out on any of them. the only class i'm having a big problem with is my biology class. i'm so interested in the material, but my professor just sucks. she's nice, and i can tell she's interested in and excited about the information, but she just doesn't know how to present it in a way that others might find it interesting as well. i've never fallen asleep in a class until this one!  and yeah. . i haven't made it to that 8am biology discussion lab on fridays. it's not‎stream of consciousness‎0

‎of doing it in the morning?  That doesn't make any sense. I need to change the song on the stereo. I'm not in a very UB40 place. Righteous Brothers are good. But this song reminds me of Joey again. I hope that the Marine Corp. Birthday Ball goes well in November. I'm really nervous. What should I wear?  Good grief, I never thought that I'd type that kind of question. How flaky. But I am still wondering what to wear. Would a gown work?  And what color?  This isn't like a school dance or anything. This is a real thing, where Marines and their wives/girlfriends are there. Older people, I mean. I always feel so much younger on the base than everyone else. I feel like they're all wondering,   what is she doing with him?   or   she's way too young to be here.   My hands are beginnning to ache. I keep backspacing my mistakes. Perfectionist. That's me. I wonder if I really am one. Maybe not. I wonder where Melissa is. I should look at her schedule. if I can find it, I mean. My feet are cold. How do I keep that from happening?  And why is it that men's feet don't get cold as often as women's?  Is it some sort of evolutionary thing?  Or just another one of those differences?  I miss my friends. Maybe not all of them---they're kind of flaky. But I miss Brandon and Lauren. And Mary. I couldn't believe that she didn't even call me yesterday. My mom told me that she has a present for me, but just didn't have my address. Whatever. She could still call me and wish me happy birthday or something. I don't get it. Sometimes I feel like she's the best friend ever. But then other times (*most times) I feel like I'm being left behind again. Why do I get left out?  I think I'd like me if I were someone else. Even when I'm with Brandon, or Lauren, when we're in a group, I'm not the popular one. I really wouldn't mind being that person for a change.  ‎stream of consciousness‎0

‎"""Geez, I'm trying to think about what I'm supposed to write about for 20 minutes. This is weird. I wonder if people use this assignment as a Dear Diary"""" thing. I wonder if the psych people are going to read every single one of these writing assignments. That would be a lot of reading to do. How can they read so much? I get so tired of reading all the time. I want to have fun. Instead of having fun though, I'm always stuck in my room reading all the time. I hate reading. School reading isn't fun. text book reading that is. I don't like reading textbooks on weird classes to read on like chemistry. Why do we need a next book for that class besides for doing homework problems. No one reads the text book crap. I don't even understand why some classes have certain books. Hm. I just don't like reading. I think this means that I'm going to have problems in college later on. Everyone always tells me that when you're in college, you have to have the patience to read everything. If what I read what actually interesting, I wouldn't have a problem. Hmm, well I remember in English in High School, a lot of the books that we read were really interesting. I liked Lord of the Flies and Anthem, and the Scarlett Letter. Those were really cool books. The bad thing about the readings was that we had to analyze EVERY SINGLE thing! I hated analyzing. I mean, analyzing is important, but not when you have to analyze stupid stuff. I remember on the Scarlett letter test we had to analyze why the grass was green. what the hell was that all about? I don't' get it! There are some things that don't really need explaining. They're just fact. How can you explain fact? Seriously, I think teachers just want to see how well we can think of things at the top of our head. I think they're trying to teach us something on that. How well you can come up with some explanation in a split second. Actually, I guess that can come in handy. Like for example it can help you with coming up with an excuse to your boss on why you were late. You wouldn't get a """"good grade"""" if your reasoning wasn't valid enough. Hmm. I don't know. Some teachers are cool. I miss my teachers back at home. I miss Mr. Fred, he was such an awesome teacher. I somewhat liked calculus because of him. He had a weird personality. that's what made him cool. I also miss Mrs. Conrey. She was fun to talk to too. I miss our little group in Bio2. That was my favorite class! I loved hanging out with the gang. Geez, I can't believe that time is gone. life went by so fast. I wish I could go back and relive some moments. not to change them. but to feel that kind of happiness again. Now, everyone is so concerned with getting‎stream of consciousness‎0

‎There are many things that have been bothering me lately. I feel as if I have been betrayed by those that should be absolutely loyal. It is sad that people must always interfere in the things that make you happy. It is as if other people sense when you are content and are trying to steal your happiness out from under you. I have made many new friends that I know will be there for me for many years to come. I feel as if I am part of a sacred family that always supports and protects those that it calls its own. Well, that family has just been defiled by the actions of one. Even though I am not perfect myself, by any means, I always try to do my best when it comes to keeping promises. I am afraid to see what may come of this action. The consequences could be severe indeed if we are found to be guilty of this false accusation. I do not understand what could possess another person to want to place his family in jeopardy just for the sake of conversation. I am deeply saddened by this recent turn of events and I hope and pray that everything will work itself out and that my family will survive and be able to grow into the future. I am prepared to accept the consequences of the actions of my brothers; that is what makes us a family. We have already grown beyond the notion of selfishness and are prepared to assist our family members in any situation, even if it means that we will suffer greatly for actions that were not ours to commit. This new family means the world to me. After leaving my home I felt alone and afraid until I found a group of friends so loyal and so trustworthy that I immediately felt at home again. I will do anything to see that my new family is not harmed or defiled in any way. I believe that it is necessary to have a strong support group to succeed, not only as a student, but as a human being. I am prepared to lay down my selfish tendencies for the good of my family. It is the least I can do. I love my new family as much as my old family. I refuse to see it be destroyed. ‎stream of consciousness‎0

‎I don't really think there is much of a purpose to this assignment. Granted, I realize its purpose but do not find it to be entirely essential to this course. I do realize, however, that this   experiment   is to be able to tap into the minds of students for a multitude of reasons. One, assuming the student submitted factual personal information (i. e. name and social security number), then certain concerned faculty members can tap into the minds of students they, a) don't like, or b) about which they are concerned. Of course, this can be helpful to understand a student better, or should that student be suicidal, intervene in a timely manner. Unfortunately, if these submissions are not read when they are first processed, then the suicide could take place without due intervention. Of course now, whoever is reading this is probably evaluating my deep psychological reasons for even mentioning suicide. I am sure that this is being analyzed as my subconcious admitting to facts that my cognizant mind would never release. This, however, is not true. While one must accept the fact the subconscious and conscious directly interact, rarely does one prevail over the other. Granted, we have absolute control of the conscious--or at least, more control than that of the subconscious. I am sure, that by now, for a 17 year old college student, I have begun to come across as some sort of pyschological analyst who has put entirely too much thought into this essay and that, for the most part, this is a typical essay and those who submit similar writings are merely trying to impress the reader with their psychological knowledge prior to and INTRODUCTORY course. This is rediculous. As an instructor, s/he probably does not care how much one particular student knows or what their analytical take on this assignment is. And thus, I shall switch from this entirely too practical frame of mind to a more entertaining frame of mind. Why don't we (yes,   we.  As in, the poker players inside my head. Actually, I'm not a fan of poker, so we'll say that we're playing four-man Chickenfoot (dominoes). Please note that the use of   four-man   was not a sexual comment, but the use of   man   was simply to imply that there are four /participants/ in the game of Chickenfoot in my mind. As long as we're discussing dominoes, how about a little trivial information?  Afterall, one does not know when s/he will appear on a radio quiz or a game show. The dots of dominoes and die are known as   pips.   You may recognize   pips   from the rock-n-roll band   blah-blah-blah and the Pips.   This, obviously, as my age has already been discussed, was before my time, and thus, I cannot recall the name of the lead singer, but merely   the Pips. ) discuss my roommate.

I need to finish reading government and psychology, and hopefully on the road too. it's a lot easier reading that though. yoga's at 8:30. am I supposed to meet melissa there or is she coming back to the room?  o well. I miss mikey =(  man, as I'm whining as if this is a diary entry. man, I forgot to call alex again. I guess I'll do it later. hmm, I wonder how tough rowing tryouts really are. o well. man, all I'm saying is o well. still not really sure what I'm supposed to be writing. now I'm listening to the juliana theory. good stuff. I'm not all about the class dj's choice of rap stuff. I don't think he is right about it making people more energetic. hearing a song for the millionth time that wasn't good the first time does not exactly put me in a great mood for an hour and a half psych lecture. but I do think I'm going to like the class (as I'm kissing up to the computer). no, its interesting stuff though. hmm, I'm still not sure about how government is going to be. I want to do law, and I think it's really interesting, but there's no way I'll have time for all the reading. and a lot of it is way too boring. hopefully if I take notes in class and what not I'll be ok. I hope calc won't be too hard this semester. a lot of it should still be review from high school, but I bet the end will be new hard stuff. too bad mikes not still around. the engineering majors are too damn smart. am I supposed to censor stream of conscious writing? because I figure that goes against the point, so I shouldn't go back and fix stuff, but this sure as heck isn't formal. o well. of course I am tempted to go back and count how many times I've said o well. ridiculous. hmm, I should really clean this room. but I guess most of the mess on my side is amber's junk. o, I guess no psych tomorrow. more time to nap in the afternoon, which is good because I know I'll be up way too late if I'm going to get close to finishing the reading for government. how late is gregory open?

‎I enjoy my life so much right now, but I am also at a really tuff time in my life right now. I love Austin and UT, but my boyfriend lives back home. Things are great between us, but it is so hard not being able to see him everyday. I miss the little things, like just being able to drive 5 minutes to go to his house, now it takes me over three hours to go to his house. I guess though that when I do get to see him, that the time we spend together is more valuable. I never realized how much we took for granted the fact that we used to live so close together. Now just to hear his voice costs money. I miss him so much. I have faith that things will work out between us, it is just going to be a long hard road through college. We have a lot of growing up to do though too. We both have a huge jealously problem, which is part of the reason we broke up the first time we were together. Whenever trusted each other enough to let the other one go out with their friends, so we were always together, and eventually I guess we just got bored of each other. I think the biggest mistake we ever made, was breaking up because a lot of things happened during the time we were broken up that puts strain on our relationship now. Although I have to thank my parents for sending me down to provisionals this summer, because when I left, Adam realized that if we did not work things out soon, we were never going to be together again, because I was not going to wait around for him. I love Adam so much, I thank God everyday that I met him. He has been my best friend for three years now, and I couldn't think of anyone that has helped me through as much stuff as he has. He has always been there for me, except for when we broke up, and he only left because it hurt him to be around me. Other than that Adam is the person that has helped me through the toughest times in my life. No matter what happened during the day, Adam can always make me feel better. He can make all my worries fade. ‎stream of consciousness‎0

‎"""Ok so I just got back from a four hour study hour thing at the ZTA house. WOW the most pointless thing ever. I read maybe 10 pages. How am I supposed to study with 50 other girls there in the room? You don't have that much space and of course you want to talk about what happened last night and who ended up where, and blahblahblah. I know they have good intentions in making us do this, but 4 hours at one time is waaay too long to try to study. No one really got anything done. But hey it was fun- I got to bond more with my sorority sisters! Speaking of sorority stuff, I love it. At first, I was afraid I wouldn't like it, or that the girls wouldn't like me, but I Couldn't be having more fun. I have more friends than I thought I would have going into college, and they're real friends, too, not friends you """"pay for"""" with sorority fees. I'm listening to music right now, and recently (as in the past couple of months) I've gotten more and more into music. I've always loved music, but ever since I dated a great guy who is a complete music person I've liked it even more. Today kyle and I (my aggie ex-boyfriend) were joking about how pathetic we are for missing eachother so much. it was funny. we knew going into it at the beginning of the summer that we were going to break up when we went off to college because, of course, it wouldn't work. But now that we're all settled in, we still miss eachother. It got really serious really fast. it was unbelievably random. We never thought we would hook-up, but it happened and it was awesome. I hate to say it because I'm so young and I hate it when people say things like that, but I could quite possibly see myself with him after college- like permanently. That's so weird. Well, sincewe did break up, we are allowed to hang out with other people (date-wise) but neither of us really wanted to. Last week I met this really cool guy from the Woodlands-he's an ATO pledge. I've gone to a couple parties with him as his date and I kind of have a crush on him. It's exciting, but at the same time, I'm far from being over Kyle. The whole point of not being together was that we could go out and have fun without being tied down, but I still feel bad about it. I have constantly had this entire """"soap opera"""" on my mind for the last week- nonstop. The cool thing about being in a relationship is that you have that stability- you never have to wonder if he likes you, or if he's going to call and all that. With a new guy it's always like I wonder if he likes me and why didn't he call?-worrying. It's fun, don't' get me wrong, but it kind of puts ur confidence in check.‎stream of consciousness‎0

‎What to write. I just missed dinner because I came down here to write this paper. I think that they should make dinner last longer then just till 7:00 at night. That sucks. Last night I requested that they give us a new couch because the one we have now hurts my back. Besides I saw what the new couches looked like and they are pretty cool. They are bright blue, not just plan gray. Grey is so boring. I wonder what I will do tonight. I could stay home and do my homework and sleep,  maybe get to see what a good night's sleep feels like. But I will most likely go out and party like I always get suckered into. So the guy situation on campus. Not to bad. The one I�m dating now is a sweetie. But now that I�m dating him it is not as fun anymore. Why is that?  The fun part is the challenge of getting the guy but now that I have him I don't want to spend any time with him. I am such a bitch. God, my eyes can't handle looking at a computer screen too long. They get all dried out. We have a Nintendo at our room upstairs, and I sit there for hours and my eyes kill me. Well, not really for hours, just a little exaggeration. My roommates are pretty cool. I like them a lot. Sometimes I feel bad because I don't spend as much time with them as they do together so now they are closer to each other and I kinda feel left out. But I spent my time with my other friends. My best friend Athena who is just down the hall and whom I love so very much. I am so glad that she is here. I would hate it here if she weren't. When I fist got here I was kinda upset that she was on my floor because I wanted my space and my time away from her, but now I love it. It is a perfect set up. I can go and visit her anytime I want and she can come to my room if she likes but I don't feel like hanging with her than I don't have to. How come I can write forever and this screen just keeps scooting over, it makes my feel like I�m not writing that much. Last time I did this I only wrote one line. And the sad thing was I was sitting at the computer for about an hour. I just had people distracting me. I wonder how you check your e-mail. I wonder if Chris wrote me. Chris is such a great guy. I hope he comes down and visits sometime soon. I miss the boy. He is the one guy I regret not ever liking. I had my chance with him and broke his heart, but I guess that's the way life goes.

She   was like 12 ,and she broke up with him by playing an Ace of Bass   song. That is like froever and a day ago. That is weird what you   remember. I can like hear the people around me. these walls are   super thin. The guys above us do the weirdest things like they make   weird noises. It sounds like they are taking golf balls and dropping   them on the floor. It is weird. They do it at random hours in the night   to which is always funny but annoying I think. Most of my friends are   guys so I don't find their stupid things that annoying because I would   probably do it too. i am not like a tom boy or anything though. Hey i   only have like five mintues though. My two guy friends that came with   me down here joined a frat , so we don't really get to hang out as   much as we used to. They are at some party getting drunk or on   some camping trip. before we came down here , we all agreed we   didn't want to go Greek ,but I guess they changed hteir minds. It   doesn't like make me mad or anything it is that I feel a little left out   sometimes. It is not their fault. i don't really want to go to the parties   though because I don't drink. Is parties with and   i   or an   s  ? Oh   well! I don't know about going Greek. I mean I am sure it would be   fun ,but I am not sure it is for me. Sometimes I think I am too fat to   join a soroity because all you see is really small girls pledging. It is   like trying out for cheerleader. i am not huge or anything. I used to be   though. I lost like sixty pounds in high school, but I am still fairly a   big girl. I look a lot better than I used to though. My sister has just   lost weight and now she calls me fat and tells me I should lose   more. She doesn't always come out and say it , but she will poke me   or laugh or tell me that i can have her old clothed because they are   WAY to small for her. She says they would fit me because I AM SO   MUCH BIGGER. That makes me so mad. I wear a 12 usually and   that is not that big. Marlyin Monroe‎stream of consciousness‎0

‎I honestly have no earthly idea. I just woke up about 2 hours ago. Drop off my younger sister at her school, which is my old high school. My boyfriend is still a senior there. At times it is awkward going there but at the same time very comfortable. I brought my (old) teacher  a lot of buckets for the upcoming carnival for the little kids. I enjoy bringing her to school 1, because I remember how horrible bus rides were. So I never rode it. Actually I rode it 2yrs in middle school, because my mom could not drop me off. And secondly I get to see my Bert. It is weird being in a relationship, not because it is uncomfortable. More like it is a different experience. I never really had a relationship until my senior year. It really isn't hard balancing my priorities. My number one priority is finishing school. Hey, I realized that my typing isn't as bad as I thought. I still have to look at the keys at times. Back to Bert. He really is an extremely wonderful person, cute, good husband material( not that I am thinking about that right now) It's just that it really is hard to find someone genuinely nice and sincere to everyone, and especially you. I think it just sucks that he is my first true relationship. Because, the old notion that the first most likely isn't the last. Only time will tell. It's about 10:02 and I didn't go to work today. Instead, I am doing this lovely assignment. Excuse my typing, I am not that good. Oh, I know what else I am thinking. My big 18 B-Day is coming up, and my dad is still holding strict control over me. Like I am twelve all over again. He doesn't realize that I am growing up and staying home this year doesn't help. Although, I love my home and mother. I only wish certain straining attitudes would alter. My first class today is math 305G. oh, boy! My teacher is actually, pretty nice. Right now it  is much more of a review, and my homework assignment is due today also. There were only actually a few problems that I quite couldn't recall. I just have to practice on more problems. I am not at all surprised of my needed review. The problems were wonderful word problems which I have never seemed to master without practice. Well look here it is three minutes past my 20 minutes. and these people are becoming a little antsy (I think that is how you spell it) about time limits. Oh, if you actually do read any parts of these assignment  I HOPE YOU ARE READING THIS BECAUSE I JUST WAS THINKING THAT YOUR CLASS IS ACTUALLY ENJOYABLE. AND I HOPE TO MEET ONE DAY NEXT WEEK, INSTEAD OF BEING A NUMBER IN YOUR 50000000 PERSON CLASS. (JUST A LITTLE PLAY WITH NUMBERS) Adios, till we meet again for the next writing assignment.

‎by the time he calls I'll probably be in my 3:30 class. Sometimes he gets on my nerves so bad, but I love him so much. I just feel like he doesn't hardly ever have time for me. It's even harder now that I'm in school. We hardly have time to talk because he's at work from six a. m. to 5 p. m. and I don't get out of class m-f until 5 p. m. By that time both of us have to eat dinner, and I have homework or he has errands to run. sometimes he comes and sees me or I go see him. Seguin isn't really that far. But it is an annoying drive. This summer we're supposed to move in together. I almost wonder if we'll still be together then. It makes me sad to even think about us breaking up. He's the best thing that has ever happened to me and I've never been happier. I've also never been sadder sometimes. I guess that's just part of being in an adult relationship. If we live together this summer, we're going to live in San Marcos. I wish we could live in Austin, but he would have to drive to San Antonio every day. Oh well. I still have six minutes left to type. I need to call my mom today and see how my family is doing. They came up to see me on Sunday, but didn't get to stay long. It really is amazing how our relationship has changed. They finally respect me and give me my own space. Before, me and my parents argued ALL the time. Now we actually have phone conversations without even saying one cross word. it's pretty nice. I know it's just because they miss me though. The lights in my room are so annoying. the ones that came affixed to the walls are bright harsh florescent lights. the other ones we bought are sooo bright they hurt my eyes. I guess I'm not going to get to work out today. It's already 12:45 and I still have a lot to do before my three thirty class. I wonder what you guys are going to learn from all this babbling of mine?  To me, I wouldn't see anything interesting about a bunch of kids rambling on about their thoughts. Damn my typing needs work. I used to be a great typist, now I have to backspace a million times to get it right. It's terribly annoying. I think after I'm done with this I might sign up for my experiments for this class. I did the pretest the other day. it took way longer than I expected. My arms and hands are getting tired of typing. I can't wait until this is over. only 48 more seconds. that fan is still making that stupid noise, and my suitemate just got home. She always slams the door.

I may go just to laugh at the SHEEP and. well. mEDITATE. And plus. it would probably light up this nice girl's life. Aww. It would also be cool to go someplace and have everyone be really happy to see you. I wonder if it would be wrong for me to go in order to reap these benefits. especially since there is NO CHANCE in my conforming to a religion. Hmm. It seems like I have been given the opportunity to explore some areas of my life that I have suppressed in the past. Certain tendencies. I guess I am really scared when it comes to this. I am afraid maybe of what I might find out if I try it. I mean. i have finally admitted to myself that these thoughts are frequent and substancial. But I don't want the course of my life to change that drastically. Right now I long for both but am happy with one. If I try the other and realize that it is so much better than the other and begin wanting only IT then I will have to do some major changes in my life and identity. But it might NOT be good. Or I might continue liking both equally. Which could also cause problems. Sheesh. """‎stream of consciousness‎0

It's like asking an oriental person if their family is originally from Africa. It's just stupid. I don't look hispanic at all. Everyone assumes too much. When I say I lived in South American, they all assume Mexico. And when I say no, then they think I must have lived in a hut in the middle of the jungle. But its not only the Americans. Now I'm remembering all the dumb questions I got when I moved to Lima. When I said I'm from Texas, they all said no you're not, you're not wearing any boots and a gallon hat. Or they'd ask where my horse was, or what happend if my horse got sick and how would I get to school if that happened. Plus I got all the dumb Bush jokes.

‎Hi, I'm sitting here in the computer lab at the FAC, and it is dark outside and I'm a young attractive female. . I'll definitely need an escort when it's time to go home. Home, that's what I call my dorm these days. it's just easier for me. I want to have some established place to live and stuff that way I'll be more plugged in to the university lifestyle. I used to laugh at LT when she called her dorm home. I guess I am following in her footsteps. although her strides are quite different from mine. and talking of strides, I miss cross country and all the guys. it was so much fun. I enjoyed every moment of it without even knowing it. I wish I could rewind back to those days when everything was so nice, so quarantined and all the laws of nature followed as they should. what went up came down and so on. I wish I could just see the fruit of my hard work as I did in cross country. the family atmosphere that I ridiculed and even took for granted at times. how could I have been so? I who loves others, I who cherishes all my friends. they were all my friends, all 23 of them. some more than others, but we all had that common goal that I find characterizes friendships. we were a sister hood. gosh, what a mourner I am, lamenting over the past. but they were good times. I'm sure, and I hope to God that I'll have some more good times or even better than ever times still to come. but this I can only hope that God gives me. For who knows tomorrow may never be. perhaps this is all I have. I'm not afraid though, just not prepared to meet my maker yet. I don't think I've done what I was purposed to do. therefore I'm not ready to go yet. in fact,,, I don't even know what it is that I was purposed to do. perhaps it is not a single great thing, perhaps it is just all those little things that I should be doing that I was purposed to do. who knows?  who cares but me and my maker?  Anyway, I guess that's life, not figuring out what one was purposed to do but just doing it. I guess it just comes naturally as all things in life do. I don't think planning is such a great idea. I don't think MLK planned to lead the civil rights movement when he was a freshman in college. I guess the civil rights found him and appointed him leader. or so I guess. and whatever it is that I'll need to do will find me and use me for what I am worth. when put that way, it sounds almost prostitution. but it cannot be. mankind is not a prostitute race. or is it. I don't know. sometimes I think it is . other times I think it is a dignified race.‎stream of consciousness‎0

‎samesex marriage based on religious reasons. (Hmm, are my two pet peeves of the day related? Of course!) J. And so I'm left sitting here, wondering how people can be so stupid as to embrace Christianity and oppose homosexuality. Ugh. THESE are the times that try men's (and women's) souls! Which brings up another point. I'm so annoyed at how misogynistic our society is. The craze in the past decade has been political correctness, and conservatives are sick of it. But things haven't changed nearly as much as people think. I still sit through lectures where the professor refers to every character described (a banker, an investor, a CEO) as he. he. he. I can't stand it. But perhaps it's not so much that these professors are bigoted to some degree. Perhaps they're simply trying to convey the way the world really is! Because women don't have anywhere near an equitable stake in society. In finance we were shown some subcommittees of the boards of directors of Procter and Gamble and Home Depot, Inc. Out of some two dozen positions between the two companies ONE PERSON was a woman! I can't stand it. I feel like I'm a bastion of fairness and equity and reason in a sea of stupid people! (Keep in mind, I'm not this pessimistic in my day to day activities, perhaps just in my mind. Hehe. ) And, not that I'm trying necessarily to relate it to our class, this is all psychology! It's probably evolutionary psychology more than anything. With regard to religion, as survival machines for our genes, we'd like to believe we will continue indefinitely. This manifests itself in various religions that promise us eternal life. And we'd like to believe that our existence isn't arbitrary, so we conjure up a god who gives us meaning, ignoring the myriad moral and logical problems this presents. With homosexuality. gay people don't reproduce if they fully express their sexuality. Of course not all do, which is why homosexuality could persist in the population as long as it has. And so on some level I'm sure we're afraid that if we accept homosexuality, more people will """"choose"""" to be homosexual. Then the species will die out! Oh no! (I know per Richard Dawkins that evolutionary psychology operates on a genetic level, not a societal level, but you see my point. ) Anyway, I suppose that's my time for this week. Tune in again next week for more ramblings from Brian's ultraliberal mind. """‎stream of consciousness‎0

‎"""just sitting here trying to avoid the whole problem of procrastination and hoping that perhaps I can get all of this done and start off the year right. I don�t know anymore about really anything and I sometimes think that I need a change in my life, like college isn't a big enough change in and of itself. The whole problem is that I need to keep doing well so that maybe I can transfer my credits. I want to go to Georgetown so bad and yet I have to do this in order to do that . God I wish that I could easily keep my room mate off of my computer and away from my shit. I bugs the hell out of me to have my email folder full of the useless crap from his anyone can pass classes. Like the morons in there with him really don't have anything better to do that waste their professor�s time and energy by having him spoon-feed higher education to these bastards with a sugar coating. It would just be easier if they were all herded together into a large barn and taught the ABC's all over again, then maybe it would make more sense to them. Maybe I�m just still adjusting to a new environment, of maybe I really do have as much vile contempt for may of the people around me as I think I do. I hope not, that could really hammer my ability to become what I want have if I end up hating three quarters of the general populous. Maybe I just need a stiff drink and a nap. Yes, it is time to stock the fridge. But what to buy, I know that the whole beer issue is a mute point and that no matter what I buy my room mate will drink it, maybe he won't be interested in the wine or schnapps or Vodka, I would really like to get a nice brandy. I just am concerned because he had little or no moral problem with eating the very expensive cheese I got at central market and so he might drink some very expensive wine all n the name  of culturing himself. That would really suck. I wish I had brought that bottle of nitrogen from home. not that  expect to be leaving wine sitting out that long but it is nice to have in any case. That reminds me, I need to subscribe to the wine connoisseur catalog. they have some really bad ass stuff that would make great gifts for my drinking buddies.

‎I feel kind of alone. I feel like I can't trust as many people as I use to. The people I trust are miles from me. I miss them. I miss talking to them everyday. Even though we still keep in touch it's not the same. I miss my hometown. I miss playing highschool basketball. College is going to be hard for me because I never study and when I do Study I can't study that long because I get tired because tired. It feels like my life is just beginning because I'm experiencing new things. I wonder if I'm going to meet the perfect girl up here. I'm kind of scared of this assignment because I don't know if I am doing it right but I think I am. I need a haircut because my hair is starting to get shaggy. I like getting haircuts. I'm tired but that's nothing unusual because I 'm always tired. I think I'm going to visit my home town this weekend. I want to see a good movie because I haven't seen one in a while. My eyes are starting to hurt because I have to stare at the keys hard. ‎stream of consciousness‎0

‎Not only was the server down but it has taken several minutes to upload, even when I am connected at 32000 bps. I'm also seemingly tired because I just got back from water polo practice and we did a lot of swimming today. I feel a sense of responsibility doing this assignment and the others so I can get  back to reading the text and doing other subjects. At this point I'm winding down the day to get ready for bed and this is the time to release all the stress and aches  and to clear my thoughts. The only thoughts the come to my mind are what I will put in this assignment after each word. I do feel a little amused because I am also having a conversation over the internet with a friend in Houston, so I am not totally out of it yet. I also have to arrange my classes for the next day so I can be prepared with my bag and books I guess. I also need to set my clock and get ready to wash up and finish this letter. But I guess this is all the time I have and I will be ending this right now   :-) ‎stream of consciousness‎0

‎TOday was an easy day for me since I only had two classes to attend. IN math, I really had a hard time staying awake. I didn�t know if it was because I knew the lesson already or was it that the teacher was boring the heck out of me. Either way, I was very tired and at times, I just dozed off. In my EDP class, I had to find information on financial aide. I also had to start a checking account at the credit union. By chance in the corner of my eyes, I could a brochure on financial loans for students. So I picked it up and will bring it to class for my presentation. Right now I'm stuck in my room and typing my psychology assignment which is due on Friday. It's an easy assignment because it will be graded on whatever you completed or not. I probably will need this grade to bolster up my average since psychology isn't really an easy class. Tomorrow will be a more challenging day with 3 classes to attend. English at 8 in the morning is a killer time for me. I had no choice but to take that time slot because all the times were filled up. I tries to call TEX many times, but had no luck. Now I have to get used to waking up early every Tuesday and Thursday at about 7:30 in the morning. It's a pain in the butt, but the good thing is that I can come back and sleep some more since my next class is at 3:30 which is psychology. I really need to take a nap before my psy class because last week on Wednesday, I didn't take one and when I attended the class, I had a hard time staying awake. I'm glad that I'm in college now because I feel more independent than at home. My mom would always get on my nerves with all her questions and nagging and now she isn't able to do it anymore. But it gets to a point where I kind of miss the questioning and the nagging which I think is contributed to homesick. I can't wait until thanksgiving when I get to go back and see the family because I really miss my baby brother. I would always take his pillow and blanket just to tease him but my mom would end up shouting at me to give it back. I also miss playing basketball with my 1tenth grade brother. He is trying out for the basketball team at his high school and I hope he makes it. He still thinks he can beat me, but that won�t probably ever be true until I'm about 60 and he's 57. This weekend, I hope to attend the football game with my friends again. I went to the one last week and we blew away Rutgers by a lot. It was a great game because there were a lot of people in attendance and the place was packed. A packful of people‎stream of consciousness‎0
‎even try to use me. Make me do all the work and they get a free ride. I am going to do really good this semester. Of course, I am going to make the connections I need to bring up my grade. You know, go to office hours, SI sessions, ask questions. Meet people who really want to study or just ask a quick homework question to. See, I like that kind of a friendship. Someone who can help me on something I can't work out on my own, then not want me to spend time with them. Maybe I just think of this as high school and its not. I am pretty sure everyone else is here to get their educaiton and get out, not to make friends. Well, after Economics class, I went to the SI session for Psychology. Now this is going to be a hard class. There is just not enough time to study. I want to spend more time studying, but I can't. I try to make room for studying at home, but my daughter makes it really difficult. I wish I would have finished school before I had my daughter. I can't even tell you what I did with my time before her. I really do hope that after I complete school, if I do, that I will be more financially stable. I hope that all this struggling and time away from my family will be worth it. I really hope I made the right decision to put us in debt over student loans for my education. I really want a college diploma. I really wish I wasn't a loser and I could get into the school of Business. But, I have accepted that I will not. But once I get my Economics degree and I become a CPA, that we will reek the benefits. I want a big beautiful house and I want to be able to pay off our credit cards and save money. I don't think that I am asking for much, but I guess everyone wants these things. More about my day, during my Pschology session, I noticed that I really don't know much about the material. I really need to get to studying the chapters. I hear the tests are really hard. Pennebaker seems like a really good professor. He makes us laugh and makes me listen and not fall asleep, but he also gives us a lot of information. (I am getting tired of typing. My hands hurt, but I like the practice in typing)  I want a lap top. I really think that if I get a lap top that I can get a lot accomplished during my study time. I could go to the library and type and not have to wait to use one of their computers. I can't even use our computer at home because my daughter gets in the way. Alex, my husband, doesn't pay any attention to her when I am there. It makes me wonder how they are when I am‎stream of consciousness‎0

‎Yuck, what a cruddy day. I had to go to 4 hours of classes and then I had to wait 30 minutes for the freaking bus to pick us up. Then I had to stand up for most of the ride home. And it was really hot on the bus. Luckily today wasn't too hot outside though. I saw on the news that we are expecting some rain and cooler weather. That's good. I guess. I don't know about the rain part though. I hope I can find my umbrella. I hope I didn't lose it when I moved up here. I live in a really neat apartment now. I like it a lot. And my roommate is really nice too. I was kind of worried about that. I transferred here from A&M this semester. I like it here. But it's not really any different than in College Station. Just bigger. My classes aren't any harder so far. I hate calculus. I'm usually pretty good at math. I think it's also because my TA that teaches our discussion is horrible. He hardly speaks English and doesn't know what he's doing at all. Of course I don�t' really know what I'm doing at all either but. Wow 20 minutes is a long time. Lots of random stuff kind of floats through your head. Like the fact that I can see that I have email and I really want to check it. I just checked it before I started writing, I guess somebody wrote back. I wonder who. Probably Amy. Amy was supposed to transfer this year too and be my roommate but she forgot to send in her transcript. She's kind of spacey about stuff like that. But she's like the sweetest person I know. Actually I don't really know a lot of people here. That's kind of sad considering I knew practically everyone at my high school and I had a lot of friends at A&M. My roommate at A&M just rushed a sorority this year. Neither one of us rushed last year. I'm happy for her. I wonder if I should�ve rushed this year. Then I�d know more people. But my boyfriend goes to school here. But he doesn�t know that many people here either. The year just started so I guess I'll meet more people as it goes by. I need to go workout tonight. I haven't worked out really well in a few days. I feel much better and more relaxed after I work out. I'm still feeling kind of stressed after my gross day. I have a lot of homework to do and a lot of other things on my list. I always make lists. I wonder what that says about a persons personality. I'm really organized and like to plan things. Maybe that's part of it. Strange. I wanted to plan a trip to go tubing in San Marcos before school started but we never got around to it. I hate how my boyfriend makes fun of me and says that I never plan anything. I‎stream of consciousness‎0

‎     The room seems to be nice and cool, much better than the heat outside. I should keep in mind that in thirty minutes or so I will go to a study group. I'm kind of hungry, i don't know what I should get for dinner today. Should I go for sushi or pasta, why am I so indecisive?  I wonder what my friends are doing right now. I hate it when I don't know what to write, or when I have a blank moment. I should remember to check if there are any conflicting exam times with my biology class exam. What is it that makes people tick?  As soon as I find the time to, I'm going to read Lord of The Rings. Maybe i shouldn't get sushi because its too expensive, but its also so good. There goes my indecisiveness again. I wonder which song I should listen to next, what am I in the mood for. This song sounds good, I guess I'll stick with this one for a while until I get bored of it. Is there any other homework left, I hate it whenever I get the feeling that I'm forgetting something but can't seem to find out what. It might be a good idea to do laundry this weekend, but i'll probably get lazy again, must remind myself not to be lazy. Maybe I should call my study partner that I might be late in coming because of thi essay. I'll turn around for a while and see what my roommate is watching on TV. I wonder if the music that I'm playing bugs my roommate or not. The TV show thats on right now seems pretty funny. I've never had Mountain Dew: Code Red before, maybe I should try it sometime, that is as soon as they restock the coke machines in my dorm. What is the point of life? All we do is try to become someone who has a purpose in society, and then in the end it doesn't even matter cause we all eventually die. I wonder what it would be like if I could be immortal. Many seems to think that being immortal is a curse cause you'll go through a lot of pain and it'll never end, I on the other hand find it interesting. I hope I can get a high GPA and keep it, it would really be nice if something academic turned out perfectly the way I wanted it to. I still kind of mad at the chemistry online homework, how could I be so stupid as to make such stupid mistakes. Oh well I can make it up on the next homework. I better do good on the exam, cause this is supposed to be easy for me since I've done it all already.   ‎stream of consciousness‎0

It's always a mixture of body odor, popcorn and some sort of Lysol. Really nasty. I wonder how Lauren is doing? I really like that girl, but lately my attraction to her is more as a friend. Sexually, she is pretty frustrating. I assume all Mormons are. But when I have numerous girls around me who are much more. um. Liberal sexually, it makes me think twice more often than I'd like. I wonder what she thinks of me. That situation with Tyler is fu. Messed up. I'm sure she knows that. But now that I think of it. That whole thing is pretty messed up. OH well. Someone came in the room and kindly asked us to be quiet. He's walking over to someone. Whispering in his ear. Smiling. Oh well. I think my battery life is running low.

But I really don't want to talk to him. The refrigerator is making this humming noise that always bothers me, even when I�m sleeping. I hope that my roommate sleeps over at trey's apartment because I don't want to hear her snore. There is somebody talking outside, I can hear them even way up here. I should turn off that light by my bed because if it burns too long everything gets too hot. The creaking of the walls here bother me too. and now some girl just ran down the hall. The airplanes can be really loud here because we are so high. I don't understand why people can't shut their doors quietly or push their chairs in without making so much noise. I wonder if anyone is going to call me in the middle of this. That would make me lose everything. Those people that call that person next door are really pretty stupid. They let the phone ring like fifteen times. In a small dorm room is that really necessary?  My typing has gotten so bad, I hate to capitalize. I should have sent that letter on Saturday, but I was just too lazy to bring it down there. Now it's going to have a weird date on the letter that doesn't match the postmark date on the envelop. I guess I�m not the only one that does that though, so it's ok. My feet are cold. They are always so cold. and today the girl next door was complaining about how hot it was. I am never hot in this room. There is some humming coming from outside. I wonder if it is just a bus being idle right now. My computer just got more energy or something because it made some noise. People are walking in the hall now, I can here them. These walls must not have good insulation. There goes a loud car that was revved up too quickly. That doesn't make sense to me. I should wash my dishes. I wonder what my neighbors are talking about when they just said """"that's really bad. """"  my wrists are starting to hurt, I should probably change my hand position. I also should do my laundry. the rest of my laundry. I need to wash my towels. I wonder how long I would have to wait in line for the stuff.

‎I am curious on why we need to do this assignment. Is it some sort of test? Or experiment? Well I guess I have to do it any way, so. I'm think that it is late and that damn pretesting takes to much time to just answer the same questions reworded ten times each. I hope my show in San Antonio goes well Wednesday I hope those assheads advertised this time but if not we still get paid. But that's still bad business. I really like the Common Sense album I think I'll burn a copy from sterling. I wonder what my roommates are up to? Probably just sleeping since they all have early class in the morning. My earliest class is Spanish and I dread going to that class. Man it takes up most of my schedule and if I don't do well it will bring my grade down big time, but crap like that happens. At least I can still be a frigging rockstar ha if all else fails. Which isn't looking so bad or hard by today's standards. One hit song will get you paid for life and all I hit songs needs is radio play. NO heart felt lyrics; no emotion, no good beat, and no moveable beat at all even just radio play. If you make it on TRL your set damn we played with Papa Roach and there were probably 700 people at the show the next week they were on TRL and now they could probably sell out a 10,000seat venue easy. I'm not putting them down they are a good band but that just goes to show you how the industry works. One of these days I'll be on top though no doubt. My band plays with a new band or a go to see a new band play ever week and half of them have no stage presence of any show what so ever. And if the crowd is not interested you can sell your total package to them. You can be a band that gets lots of radio play, but if you can get the crowd moving on tour your going to just sparkle and fade. My only fear is I'll be a 30yearold man with kids and still be hunting for this illusive dream and I really don't want to be in that boat. I assume I'll know when the ship has sailed and I'll just except it and move on not swim after it just to sink deeper. Only time will tell though, if nothing else I had my days in the spot light but if my 15 minutes of fame are already up I'm going to be one upset greedy bastard trying to get my hand on just a little more.

Not to say they are not important it just my dreams cloud my reality and‎stream of consciousness‎0

‎This morning I went to class at 8:00AM. I was really tired so I guess I should have gone to bed earlier than I did, but I was having fun with my neighbors. After my 8:00 class, I had two more classes, but now I'm done for the day. I was so hungry when I got back at noon that I had to go eat right away in the cafeteria. Now I'm trying to do some of my homework because I have a lot to read. College is more demanding than high school. I never had to read a lot in high school, but now it seems that all of my classes require me to read 2 chapters a week. It's very hard to keep up with. And it's distracting in the dorm because something's always going on that you want to participate in. but when you have so much to do you have to set your priorities. My roommate just came back from class a few minutes ago. Her schedule is very different than mine. She went to the roof to sunbathe and then came back to the room. I really don't want to study. I'd rather watch Fear Factor that I taped last night. I was eating dinner at 7pm yesterday and therefore had to tape it instead of just watch it. I am going home this weekend to see my boyfriend. And then on Sunday I might be going to a waterpark with some of my new friends here. They are nice people. There are quite a few people here from my high school in Houston, but not many people that I was friends with. One of my friends, Sandy, is here and actually lives in the same dorm as me. She lives on the 22 floor though. I live on the 18th. It's really hard to get an elevator from this high up in the building. Sometimes I have to wait almost 5 whole minutes for one. That is especially annoying when you are on your way to class. This morning I was almost late for my economics class because I went to breakfast with my neighbors. I wasn't really hungry but I had a yogurt and some orange juice. Then I felt kind of sick. I made it to economics, but just barely before the teacher started class. My economics class is all the way over in Jester, and I live in Castillian, so it's annoying to walk all that way. Especially at 8AM. Monday, Wednesday, and Friday I don't start until noon though, which is really nice. On sunday I didnt wake up until 2:30pm. That is the longest I have ever slept in. Tuesday and Thursday I have 8AM classes, but that was because I had no choice. I went to the 6th orientation, so I didnt have much left to pick from. One of my neighbors is from Houston like me. Except he's from Kingwood, which is where my boyfriend's dad lives. I like it out there, because there are lots of trees.‎stream of consciousness‎0
‎it back to that and call it a disease, but really, your mind. that's where you control it. I keep hearing how our mind can heal us and how we think has an enormous impact. Do we not have control over our mind? That should be the one thing we do have control over, and that is where the power is. Is it really incorrect to say that depression is all in your mind? I think not. I guess that I'm not being fair to the depressed people because my life is good. close enough to perfect for me. I am lucky to not have to deal with all the garbage many people have to deal with. I had a good child hood, good parents. No worries really. But, it is not like I've never been depressed. I spent most of my freshman year in high school depressed, but now I look back and understand why I felt that way and how silly it was, and I don't plan on doing that again. I guess, you just have to live and learn. I mean it's ok to do what's wrong just as long as you eventually figure out it's wrong and fix it. Ok. what was that all about? I ramble so much. It's hard for me to have conversations with people because my mind always feels like it's in 10 places at once. I'm tired. I really am. I always feel a little tired. I had a terrible encounter with mono my freshman year in high school. It was horrible, and ever since then I get tired easily. Maybe it's all in my head and I can convince myself that I'm not tired. I should try this. It could be very beneficial. I am already starting to procrastinate. Why? Why is procrastination and epidemic among youth? Hey, I think time is up. I could go on for hours, but I really should get to my other homework. or not. ‎stream of consciousness‎0

I have never seen any before and now I want to go buy the  whole set because it was so good. but I need to get my job first and save up my money for headshots, an agent, then I can buy crap like new clothes and videos and cds. I can't wait until tomorrow, it is going to be so much fun!  I hope that I feel okay. I feel better today but tomorrow I need to be totally healthy. I hope I did one of those things where I got sick at a good time so I didn't miss anything important. This writing takes forever, I have other stuff I need to do to. Oh, well, it's for science. I m bored. my eyes are drying out from looking at the computer screen. when is clay going to get back?  I also have some theater homework I need to do. I am so tired, maybe I should just forget the how and go to bed early so I feel good tomorrow. yeah then I could fail all my classes and get kicked out of UT. that would suck. I did nothing today. it was a relaxing though somewhat boring day. but I needed it because I have been sick all weekend. I have been able to start smoking again, but I really should quit sometime soon. I am tired, it's hard to focus. I guess my body has been working over time to kill this damn disease I got.

I am really determined to get into upper division nursing after 2 years. I don't know what I will do if I don't. I guess I will just transfer back home and go to school there if I can't get in here. But I really want to prove that I can get in here. I am trying really hard in my classes, but it just doesn't seem to be doing me any good. I read what I am supposed to and work the problems, but I just can't seem to learn the material. I'm not taking any dance classes right now which is really ackward for me. I have never gone a year without dancing. Last year I was dancing 4-6 hours every week day and this is just strange. I don't excerise in any other way than that so I am starting to feel out of shape. Dancing was my way to let everything out. I wasn't always as good as I wish that I could be, but it was a way for me to prove to people that I was good at something. Here I can't do that. I am just another person walking down the side walk. At home, in such a small town, everyone knew who I was. And here I think I know about 20 people at the most. None of my friends came here so it isn't like I really have a relase. I am going to go home this weekend, and I know it is kind of soon, but I really miss my boyfriend. Maybe I am just not cut out for this large college atmosphere. It might be best if I go home, I know mom and dad would like that a lot more. But I am tired of doing everything for my parents. I never did anything in high school for myself. Mom and I got into arguments all the time and it seemed like my whole life I was just trying to prove myself to her. She treated me like a child even last year, like I was still 12 and couldn't take care of myself. Being an only child I was smothered by my parents and grandparents. I don't know. It was nice getting what I always wanted, but sometimes I wished that there was someone else there to put the blame on. It's hard to handle everything that went on in my family. Someone once told me to write down what bothered you and it would make you understand better about what was going on and how to fix it. It doesn't work. Besides, I get tired of writing all of that down. I am super duper hungry right now butI don't want to eat because I am really afraid of the freshman 15. I haven't been eating well lately. I won't eat most of the time, but then it seems like when‎stream of consciousness‎0

‎that it has prepared me a little for this. I'm really good with endurance which is key in rowing. In high school, we had to march for 8 minutes straight. my senior year I had a solo and I had to run around to my different sets and then stand still and play a long slow balad for a couple of minutes and make it musical. That was pretty hard to play without people realizing I'm completely out of breath. But it was really rewarding, I had the opportunity to play in front of thousands at a time at our football games. I could never get up in front of a crowd and speak or sing, but I can play my flute in front of anyone. I really wish I was able to be in the UT band. I had always wanted to be part of the band, but now my major doesn't allow the time. I hope that later in my college career, I have the chance to be in the marching band at least once. I think it would be so much fun. Music has always been a big thing in my life, I love to play it, but I also love to listen to it. My favorite kind of music is country. I especially love george strait. I have most of his cd's. I know every word to every song he sings, I only need to hear the first chord of one of his songs and I'll know its him. I'm also a big fan of 80's movies. one of my favorites is young frankenstein. mel brooks makes wonderful movies, I think they're all hilarious. real genius is another good one I like. most of my favorite movies I'm able to quote from beginning to end. one of the classics is the princess bride. there are so many great one-liners in that movie. my dad and I always say random quotes from movies anytime something happens. my dad knows the most trivial things. he'll know the answer to the most random question you can think of. its pointless, but its pretty cool. my dad and I are really close, I wish I could be more like my dad. we grew really close when my mom passed away when I was little, he remarried, and now I have a brother and a sister. I love my little sister so much, she's the cutest. she never uses my real name, she always calls me sister. I really miss her. but I talk to her often and she's always so excited to hear from me. she just got a new rabit, she's had 5 and three of them were sold in the stock show and one of them died. but now she has 2. I hope the heat doesn't get to these two like the others. she's always really worried about them. she also has a dog, and I have a dog named princess. my dog is a choc. lab. she's really cute, but she's also really old.

‎I've never felt empty ever before, its amazing how complete your life feels for a certain time and then just because of this one person everything just falls apart and you have to start all over again I know it happens to everybody at some point of their lives but whoever it must be happening to they must be going through hell. I believe in god and I know that whatever he's doing its for my betterment but I wonder why he did this in the first place if he wasn't going to make it work. Right now there are so many questions in my mind but there is no one to answer them at all I'm feeling so disgusted with everything I feel angry and its all because on this one person who before a year didn't even mean anything to me and now rules over all my thoughts and feelings. I wish I could foresee the future or go back into time and fix up everything before it falls apart. I'm sitting in a lab full of people and my friends come every now and then and say hi to me and treat me sweetly and every other second my thoughts keep going back to this evil person who just messed up everything I do. I must be sounding like any girl who's fallen out of a relationship but I don't care I'm very hurt, and in my case I know he doesn't care at all whether I'm sad or depressed because he has someone else waiting for him at home who's going to make it alright for him and make him forget me forever and ever. and me? I m going to cry and keep thinking of him for a long time because I know I'm true and I loved him even if he didn't. So if I cry I know its because of the love I feel for him, and he doesn't care because he never really loved me at all, and I was stupid all the way to believe that he did. I promise never to be that stupid again I'm going to immerse myself in my work and other people and get on with my life whether my heart likes it or not because all this while I've been doing whatever my heart wanted me to do and didn't do whatever my brain wanted me to but now I'm going to think practically because I know that in this cruel world people who care for others get run over and only the cold hearted survive. So I am going to be cold hearted. and I'm going to be mean. sweet from the outside and mean from the inside just how he is. the whole world loves him because he's sweet from the outside but no one knows about how dark he is from the inside as bitter as an evil man who's never any good for anyone in his life.

‎     I am listening to Tracy Chapman, The Promise, and this song makes me soo sad. I think about Toby, and how this song completely makes me want to do what the song says. I want to find my way back to Wisconsin. I am actually going through a very emotional and frustrating time right now. I don't know how many things are going through my head but there is alot to think about. I don't know what I want to study. I have no goals, and that in itself is sooo frustrating. I want to be able to start working towards something. I love being able to definitely have a plan. I am not someone who can handle doing something unexpected. But I am starting to cope with. Another thing that I am dealing with right now, that I constantly have in the back of my mind, is the fact that I am in love with someone sooo far away, that I've spent a week with. I learned last night in my meditation class that love is the key to everyones happiness, or anunda. Everyone desires love; everyone wants to find and experience love. And once found, then nothing can become a barrier. But for me it is my parents money that is a barrier. I've never been on my own, and they are paying for everything right now. They pay for my apartment, schooling, books, and they give me a sum of money to live off of. I doubt that if I wanted to be a full time student that I would be able to have the luxuries that I do now, and have a job, and support myself. However, I want to experience my own dreams. I want to be able to say and do what I please with  no strings attatched. Man it feels good to say that. I only wish I had the courage to actually do what I am thinking. I want to travel and find love, and discover who I am before I can make any decisions whatsoever about my future. I am soo completely lost in the ideals of my upbringing and the conflicting ideals that I feel are more important. I fell that my parents have not experienced true happiness because they have chosen to live a conservative life full of restrictions both imposed by society and imposed by their own ignorance of what is True (with a capital t) I want to get away from it. Howeveri t is going to take much courage on my part. TO part with everything I have grown up believing. Well, not entirely. I still posess the same morals and ideals of what a person should be to stay peaceful and good. However, the materialistic impositions that I have lived with, the restrictions of what I can do, and the expectations that they have of me that I will never fulfill. I can't speak to my parents without them shrugging or belittling my desires and aspirations. Obviously they are not‎stream of consciousness‎0

I get to see them this weekend, and I cannot wait. my roommate likes to listen to music while she studies and that is the only conflict that we ever have, I guess that I just need to say something to her, cause I'm sure that she doesn't care. well, actually, I know that she doesn't. I hope that I can fit everything into my schedule that I need to, cause I have a lot on my """"to do list"""". haha, I'll try! that's all I can do. this whole new responsibility thing is something that I thought would be less than it is. I mean, I thought that I was pretty responsible, but I'm guessing that now I'm not. you learn new things about yourself everyday. but, I'm glad that my parents raised me that way that they did. I miss them. but that's ok, cause I have so many new friends down here that I don't know what to think. I've had some dates, but nothing GREAT and way exciting so far. I guess that I'm picky but that's a good thing. maybe God will just bless me w/ some amazing guy while I'm hear at school well, it doesn't have to be this year cause I have too much going on right now. haha, ok. my phone rings way to much. and people are always stopping by, like about 5 people just walked in my door. I need to catch up on my quiet times. yep, I do. I wish that I could control how much I eat, well, I guess that if I keep on telling myself that, then I need to take some action. well, self, listen. I hope that my interest grows stronger in my nursing major cause its kind of vivid right now. anyway, all this nutrition talk makes me think about eating right and working out and stuff. I need to shave me legs. ok, all this homework is quite an overload. I really like my room, I think that it reflects my personality. I change my thoughts a lot. I expected that when I would write this, that I might just write about one thing, but I keep thinking about a lot of things. I guess that I didn't think about it too much, cause I get distracted very easily. they are in there talking about brittney spears. most people don't like her but I like her. haha, weird for a girl, but I love to dance and sing. I think that she's talented. I hope that I don't have to go back and capitalize all the beginnings of my sentences cause I haven't done it this whole time. now my roommates are joking about their dates.

‎Okay so I was thinking about what our dj said in class on the first day that he played some music on the topic that dealt with bot hip-hop mainstream music and trance and how they differed. This was something that I really wanted to see if there was a difference in the way the music makes you feel and I seemed to have noticed a difference. I first tried it out on reading a book. I realized that it was much easier for me to concentrate on what I was reading, as well as, getting more into the book because the trance music makes you think of what you are reading about. When listening to trance music it affects your brain in a way that is very interesting to me and I kinda want to look more into this whole topic of discussion. I am listening to a dj named Paul Oakenfold who is a trance dj, and even as we speak I can feel that beat bouncing all around inside my head causing me to think about what I am writing. Yesterday, last night, actually I was doing some reading and I started to first listen to hip hop and I kept on distracting myself by trying to sing along with all of the different rhymes because I know a lot of them. I ended up spending about 30 minutes and I got through about 12 or 13 pages which is incredibly slow. After that I decide to try out some trance. I actually used to always listen to trance last year when I would read or study because I always helped my expand my mind when I was either designing things, reading, or writing. So when I was reading I noticed that I was much more attentive to what I was doing and got a lot more than 13 pages read in a 30 minute time period. As of right now I am trying out this trance thing again. The funny thing is, is that there is a lot of things going on around me right now. The TV  is on, my roommate is sitting next to me on his computer doing his homework, and my girlfriend is on my bed reading her book, and at the same time we are all extremely focused in all of our own independent studies, not even paying attention to the TV  but to the work that we need to get done. After thinking about this right now I am at 9 min 30 sec and I have already written a lot. I believe that if I would have not turned on the trance music that it would not have given me a basis to explain my theory on what we were talking about in class. Another thing that kinda triggers my mind now that I am talking about class related things, how does this affect your nerves inside your body and inside your brain? how is your body receiving these messages that make you get like this numbing feeling‎stream of consciousness‎0

I wish my regular computer waS WORKING. OOPS I JUST PUSHED THE CAPS LOCK BUTTON. thats better. I also can't help but think how hungry I am. Maybe I should go down to the cafateria and get a quick byte. Than again I could just make something real quick that taste much better. geez this bracelet doesn't make it easier to type either. thats better. Maybe if I move the laptop onto my lap. eh. . somewhat better. My girlfriend should be comming back soon. I am glad she joined a sorority. it gives me some space. I wish she would understand that I need my space. oh well that will just be an ongoing argument between the two of us. there goes my stomach again. My suitmate should be leaving soon for a fraternity event. To bad erik's parents wouldn't let him join a fraternity. this song is catchy. but it is played out. I am so mad about my car. I don't understand how a brand new car won't start. At least I got it into the shop quick. I hope I get it back tomorrow. Linkin Park's new cd is so amazing. I wish jennifer didn't give me such a hard time about putting it on. I think I will listen to it aftter I finish typing. I am half way through. This assignment is pretty cool. I never realized how much I could write in twenty minutes. my psychology class is huge. I wonder how many people are in it. It has got to be at least 400 kids. It is so different seeing a teacher standing infront of all those kids. they even have a microphone. Those huge projectors that are built into the wall are so awesome too. I hate commercials. . I wonder when I will get to use my checks for the first time. I have never had to use a check before. I think I will like going to UT. Its only been a week and a half and I love it. It is so stressful living at home. Always having to do somehting. I know that my parents do everything for me, but they always keep me busy. I wonder what I can eat. I wonder how long I can last without eating. Maybe Jennifer will get back soon and make me a great meal. She is so good to me. I really do Love her. I hope my dad gets me those Incubus tickets. I really want to go. Eminem is always on the radio. . I wonder what he was talking about at the vma's the other night. Something about punching a guy with glasses.

‎Realizing that I am on my own left to create a future all by myself is a responsability which excites me. Everyday, I open my eyes and look around the room to see my roommate ( a perfect stranger only a few weeks ago) eating her daily breakfast and I have to hit myself just to make sure that my life is a reality. I have waited so long for college, for freedom for independence and now I posses all these things. And as excited as I am, I also ponder in thoughts of dissapointment. Not in myself or my actions but in all I have left behind. Yes I am talking about my family and friends and my own room and homemade meals, but I am also talking about my childhood and innocence. Ok, go with me for a little bit--- I know it's cheesy and a little extreme but it's true. I am on my own now, making all (well actually most) of my decisions on my own. I don't have my mom yelling at me to stop talking on the phone or to start doing my homework. My teachers aren't there to take role call or to ask you how life is treating you. All those thing that I took for granted but were a daily part of my life. Don't get me wrong, I love the freedom of college and the fact that I can talk for hours without my mom yelling at me or the fact that my teachers won't call  my mom if I happen to skip class. I really don't know where I'm going with this, all I can offer as an explanations is that just because a freshman loves their new found freedom does not always mean that they don't miss their old life. It's hard growing up and facing up to the challenges of responsibility. I am often tempted to call my parents and beg them to send me a homemade meal or to remind me to set my alarm clock so I don't oversleep. Yet, I should confess that so far, I am handeling the whole responsability thing quite well. One thing I  certainly enjoy is the fact that I can spend more time with my friends and I can go out on weekdays and I can eat unhealthy food as much as I want. Not to say that I indulge myself in such activities constantly. I guess the point of it all, is that I am confused. I am trying to find out who I am. And I think college can bring such valuable experinces as to help you understand yourself a little more. Throught the lonly moments, and the paries and the classes, through it all, I think that we are all supposed to learn a little about ourselves as well as others and the world surrounding us. Oh, and ofcourse, to get and education.  ‎stream of consciousness‎0

‎This will be an interesting writing assignment, especially fro you readers. Typing out my stream of conciousness thoughts is not exactly something I'm familar with, as you may notice through all my misspellings and everything else you'll notice wrong with my paper. I'm listening ti the Lord of the Rings soundtrack right now, and my room is freezing!!  Brackenridge, even if the rooms are spacious and it's in a convient location, had the most frigid, uncomfterabel environment to live in. Half the time I walk around bundled in every layer of clothes I can find-- I feel liek an Eskimo!!  of course I wouldn't be in my room so much if things at UT were going a little better. Sorry, usually I'm not a whiner, but this past week has been extraordinarily rough. I feel like I don't know anyone, which I don't, and sometimes I 'll go through whole days on just a couple of words spoken to my room mate. A feeling of total isolation isn't exactly the easiest to deal with. I'm usually a pretty social person, actually, i just have trouble meeting the people. However, once I get to know them, I 'll open right up. Yep, I'm an oyster or something--once you get 'em open. My parents haven't called me, which is only a little troubling. I thought most parents wre supposed to hang off onto their child's every footstep as they walked out of the nest to college. My sister has called me a couple of times and actually planned a visit, which I am definitely looking foward to. So, instead of going out with friends or talking to people that care about me, I do my homework. I must be the most ahead inmy studies of any student at UT. Spanish is actually the hardest class for me right now, and probably the least interesting (which might contribute to the hardness factor). Philosophy, Poesis and Psychology are definitely tied for most interesting class of the semester award. I knew I loved English, suspected I'd enjoy the biology and problem-solving of Psychology, but I had no idea I'd find Philosophy even slightly interesting. Right now, I'm reading about the Hindu religion. I love the idea that I'm getting education!!  Psychology and Philosophy fit so well together, too. Usually I study one right after the other because of the overlap in some of the topics that the two classes discuss. While Philosophy ponders the idea of mind in a very abstract, ideal form, Psychology makes more of a direct pursuit to it's functions and how it works. It's amazing to see the two find out the same things or how a discovery in Psychology will back up a wispy thought in Philosophy. Now I'm getting really tired of writing those two class names. I read something interesting the other day that reminded me somewhat of this writing assignment.

Instead, the hospital I went to, we had an eighty year old man take us on a hospital tour. Like I've never seen a hospital before! All in all the trip was fun because I at least got to see Boston. I had never been on the East coast before and it was really interesting. Boston is an amazing city but it is way too chaotic. I had been accepted at Boston University and I did not go there because it was way too expensive, and after actually going to Boston I was glad that I did not choose to go there. I mean, I love big cities and all, but Boston is just way too big. I would lose myself there. So here I am at UT. I am from Michigan and my final decision in a school was between UT and UofM. The only reason I came to UT was because my parents moved to Dallas a few weeks ago for my dad's job so I figured I might as well come to school here too. Being up in Michigan with my parents down here just seemed like it was way too far. I am ready to get away but not that far away. Texas is so different from Michigan. It is really hard to get used to. I have never seen a state show their state flag so much. It is cool, just different. I live in Michigan for 17 years and I don't even know what the state flag looks like. Everyone down here is really nice though. I like that a lot. I guess it is a southern thing, because people are really eager to talk to you. I can't believe how many people I have met and I have only been here for a week. I like UT a lot and I am glad that I chose this school. I am sure that after time I will feel like a true UT student.

‎For some reason I am very tired. Ever since I have been up here I always feel tired. Some days I don't do very much so it does not make sense for me to be very tired. I also get very bored sometimes. I can think of absolutely nothing to do. I wish I had my computer so I could save this so later I can see what I wrote. I thought I would be doing more and going more places when I got up here. My friends that I am always with up here are not very active and exciting. I miss my best friend a lot. I don't miss home, just the people there. I also miss my very, very good friend who goes to school in Indiana. I miss him so much. I think about him all of the time. I miss him more and more each day. He is just my friend, so I don't know what is wrong with me. We became a little closer over the summer. Some people that I know think that we should date. I don't know. I think I might like him, but I sometimes feel that I shouldn't. I don't know. I miss him so much. I worry about him all the time. I also worry about my brother and my sister very much. Hopefully, I will get to visit Justin in Indiana for Thanksgiving. However, he might come home. I really hope that he does come home. If I go up there I will get to see real snow. I like it up there very much. I don't know why. I have been twice. I really like his friends up there. They are great guys. We have lots of fun together. All the guys who go to his school are gentlemen. I have told myself that if I don't like it here this year that I will transfer next year. But, I love it here, even though I get bored sometimes. I love Texas. Justin hates it for some reason. He thinks I should transfer to a college near Indiana. I have thought about it. The only thing is that I like it here. If something goes wrong I might transfer. I would love to be closer to him, but anything I have ever done for a guy has turned out bad. One should only do things for oneself and one should only listen to their own heart. I'm not sure what my heart is telling me to do, yet. See, I need to quit thinking about him so much and concentrate more on school and studying. This is what I came to college for. To study and learn, not in search of a relationship. I need to remember to go to Mezes and sign up for experiments. I wish we didn't have to do that, but it is much better than writing a 5 page paper.

‎     I wish travis would stop switching channels on the TV. actually i wish my internet was hooked up already. then i wouldn't have to be over here in his getto room. granted he is like my best friend from elementary that boy needs some help. or maybe its just because he is a boy. i have a few other friends that are guys that have issues with cleaning their rooms. but for the most part by this time in thier life i would expect them to be able to clean up after themselvesm. maybe my expectations are too high. i know they can be to high for my self sometimes but if they werent then i wouldnt' be here at UT. i would have just stayed at home and gone to community college. So in that respect i am glad to have standards that are maybe too high. it keeps me interested in whats going on. ok so travis is talking to the tv, now i know for him this is normal but still it seems odd to me. For a 19 year old i wouldn't expect him to be watching nick jr at 10 in the morning. i mean he was the validictorian of my class shouldn't he be studying or watching something educational or at least more mature?  i dunno. i think he is going to the game with me and some of my friends. im a little concerned with how they are going to treat him. he doesn't come off as the straightest guy you've ever met. infact he doesn't come of as straight at all. although he claims he only likes gals. i don't really believe him and im kind of just waiting for him to come out. in high school he was the only male cheerleader in the history of the school and its a small school. he wasn't good at it either but the school couldnt' say no to him because they thought he might sue if they didn't let him in. so they did. but then when he wasn't allowed to dance with the female cheerleaders he threw a fit which really didn't go to his straightness accredation. but i know one day he will just be like   kendra im gay   and i'll be like   i know its about time    and then life will continue just as it always has. ha reading rainbow is on. i haven't watched that show in forever. i didn't even know it was still showing. i knew mr. rogers retired. i grew up on that show. i grew up on all of PBS. i was really big into it and my younger brother just wasn't so when he was old enough to say what he wanted to watch it was something like power rangers or ninja turtles. he would throw a fit if i was watching pbs. he didnt' learn to read as fast either. im sure their is a correlation but i think‎stream of consciousness‎0

‎I am sitting in my dorm room listening to my roomate talk on the phone to her boyfriend. I have just finished studying and everything i have just read is all jumbled in my head. I am thinking about the weekend and what I am going to do because my roomate's sister is coming to stay with us. She is a junior and has just come out and said that she is depressed. I want to take her out and make sure she has a good time. However, I went to my chapter meeting tonight and they told us that this weekend we were having out pledge retreat and a field day on Saturday. I have so much to study for and so much reading and I have to entertain a 16 year old girl. I don't know how I am going to get everything done. But I know that everything will work our because it always does. I am listening to little pieces of information about my roomates conversation and am very curious as to what is going on. It sounds very interesting. I am just thinking about everything that I need to do and all of the people I need to talk to. It is so difficult when you have to talk to all of your friends from your hometown and talk to your mother while trying to go to class, meetings, and everything else. It seems there are never enough hours in the day. My roomate is offering our room to a couple of her friends to come stay at our dorm this weekend. The girls are extremely annoying and I think I will have to find somewhere to stay. Hopefully our retreat is overnight. It has been alright with my roomate and I. He were best friends in Elementary school but things do change. I came in the other night and she was drunk and was trying on my clothes. It pissed me off but I can't say anything just because she is too nice. She left this weekend and went to San Antonio and stayed with her boyfriend. They got a hotel room for the night. It was nice having the room all to myself. I have my entire schedule with a boy who I went to high school with. I was shocked at first but now it is very helpful. We can tell each other and remind each other about assignments and other things. I went to my FIG class today and felt like I was back in the fifth grade. He assigned us a project where we have to create a shield. The usual what you like, a word that describes you, and other stuff to that nature. I finally talked to my ex-boyfriend today for the first time in a couple of weeks. We broke up because we were going to different colleges and he couldn't handle it. He is too much of a guy.

I wonder why because all the other Internet sites I go to always show up real fast. I guess Kristine is not going to go with me to sign up for psychology experiments. By the way I thing that these experiments that we have to do are BS. I think that that the psychology department needs someone to experiment on so they make the psy301 students be the guinea pigs( I think I spelled that wrong. Oh well. )  If we don't do the experiments they punish the students by making them write a 5 to 10 page paper. Ultimatum. I really need to work on my spelling but I won't.

I really want to make an A because that would increase my prospects at getting a good first job, of course that would only be good for a first job. I really don't like my job at HEB it is really annoying, all people seem to be in a bad mood all the time and I don't find it that enjoyable. If I were somehow rewarded with more money I think it might be managable however, because I can't seem to get a raise out of them I'm going to look for another job. I hope my typing doesn't wake up my roomate my girlfriend is really distressed about our relationship I guess I'll have to write her an e-mail and make things better between us. How I would describe love right now, I've always thought that you had different degrees of love throughout your life, I would say that I love her however. i really hope my roommate is a deeper sleeper than I think he is because I know I would be annoyed if he were typing where I could hear it. Tommorrow I have to go get my Economics book in the morning and read part of that, college seems so stressful, I don't know if I'm going to be able to budget my time. The bookstores rip you off you pay all that money for books and then they buy them back cheaply and then sell them for the same price that you bought them for. That might be a good way to make some money buy opening a bookstore. My dad was telling me how having a low overhead would produce a lot of profits for something on the internet. I had better be quiet so my roomate doesn't hear me, but the noises in the hall are louder but not constent. He has too wake up at 7:00 in the morning to go to class. I don't know how well we are getting along, I guess he is an ok roommate but I wanted him to be a little more outgoing. I guess I'm going to have to meet people on my own which I'm not all that good at but I guess I'll have to try. I need to find out what my rights are in this room and if I'm able to type till just 12:00 or if I can type and make noise till one. I'm willing to try and make it as comfortable for him as I can because I want to fit in with him, but I don't know if I should draw any lines or not.

Oh man to get to talk tohim would be the bomb. I don't know though because he has a girlfriend and that just isn't cool. Ah. My friend Matt e-mailed me today. He is just so weird. I don't know.

Why am I thinking about her? I wonder what Robin is doing? Man, I must feel really guilty about Robin and Brooke because UI think aobut them a lot. I wonder what TAsha and Nance are doing.

I don't know how some people do it. They can just go to class, not do any of the reading and be okay with that. If I'm behind in a class it bothers me until I get it done. Then after I sit down and do the reading or the homework, everything's so much better. All I did yesterday afternoon was read. I'm caught up in psychology and journalism finally.

‎government and instill a new parliament based on Islamic religious law. In poor Middle East countries, where starvation and poverty are extremely high, people having nothing positive to look forward to, so they turn to fundamentalsim. The same movement is happening right here in the United States. Some religious fundamentalist leaders, like Pat Robertson and Ralph Reed, are calling for mandatory school prayer and the inclusion of religion into public instituition. It is their intention to make the United States a Christian nation by passing legislation in favor of the religious right, which happens to be WRONG. The founders of our country included a seperation of church and state clause into the Constitution for a purpose, and that was to keep America a secular nation. The radical right wing is trying to change this very core of our country. Learning fundamentals might be good in athletics, but preaching religious fundamenalism is a dangerous threat to all of society. I commend freedom seeking nations like the United States and Israel for doing their part to combat this worldwide problem, which if not stopped will affect everyone in a very horrific manner.

‎is being super condescending. I know that he feels that he wants to enjoy the fine fruits of life; food being one that should be simple to enjoy, but with his ideal of fine food, I don't know if he will ever feel that. That's one thing about psychology. My boyfriend always says what he wants, but he never feels it when I try to give it to him. I believe that he never feels it because somewhere in his head, his innate response to anything I do is a negative one, therefore his response is negative. His mind tells him to not like it and therefore he ends up thinking that he really doesn't like it. It's all in the mind. If he told himself to like it, he would; But the fact of the matter is that he doesn't. All right, I'm going to shut up about him all ready. I think that this writing assignment is pretty cool. It's like writing in an electronic diary, like on the show """"Sex and the City,"""" except that these thoughts are really not very private because I guess Professor Pennebaker or one of the TA's is going to read it, but I'm really okay with one of them reading it.

I don't think I've gained any weight here because I do so much walking, so who cares if I ate extra macaroni; I used skim milk instead of whole milk, and I added salt to it instead of butter, thus I feel no guilt.

‎it must have been that Sunday I helped dad. I really wish I had eaten something other than Burger King. I should have eaten Subway. I enjoy tuna subs better. I just yawned. I think I need stamina. My watch is digging into my are. I now have a whole impression of my watch in my arm. That kind of stuff annoys me. This watch is too little. It is made for little kids. I'm going to close my eyes while I type. I hope I don't mess up too many words. That would a bad think if it couldn't be read. I need to get a haircut, I want to get it styled, but I�m scared that the way it will be done won't look good. I�m taking off my watch now, it 's bothering me too much. why does my stapler have such a big crack down the middle of it  I wonder why the mail didn't come yesterday. that makes me so mad. I bet I would have had mail. this gum is tasting pretty gross but it tastes better than the burger. Yawn. now I have goosepimples. why am I so cold. I should probably put on a long shirt. why doesn't my camera rewind all the way. Maybe I should just get a new one. one of those advantage ones that I can take to Switzerland. that would be great for all the scenic pictures. Yawn. why do my eyes water so much when I yawn. that is very annoying. there goes the telephone again. I bet it will ring for a long time. nope it only rang once. I guess the girl is there now. my computer just froze up kinda, I bet I did something wrong, I am always doing something wrong. I wonder how fast I can type without making lots of mistakes. so far I am doing pretty good. why is it whenever you say that you get worse. ,  the second I said it, it got worse. now my wrists are really hurting. someone is going into their room, and the just slammed their door. that just bothers me so much.

I wonder what they were in such a hurry for at 9:30P. M. Maybe he was running to get more beer for the party. Just kidding again. No need to get investigators up here or anything. But earlier today there was some really loud music coming down the hall and the voices of about fifteen to twenty people, so something was definitely going on. I was thinking about emailing that DJ guy for our class. I don't remember his name, though. I have some suggestions for songs he could use for our class, and one of them would correlate nicely because the song is about some guy who loses his mind and doesn't think he is. He thinks everybody is wrong who is trying to help him. OK! I only have one minute left. After this, I think I'm going to get ready for bed because all this Sigmund Freud type psychology assignment is making me a lot more sleepy. I think changing that tire made me a lot more sleepy than I thought I was when I first started typing this. """‎stream of consciousness‎0

I am trying to figure out why my email is not working. It keeps making me re-log in and it is really getting annoying. Oh well, two more days to the weekend. Arkansas comes in town this weekend so it should be a fun game. I saw some of the football players today. Wow, they are so huge. They are like a different breed of people. I want psychologists to study their genes and see how they get so big. I know it is some sort of phenomenon or something. I figured out that in 2 minutes I have to find something new to do so I am already brainstorming. I wish every paper was this easy. English papers are so analytical and this is just what is on my mind. It could go on forever. I never have to stop and think. Dell: what an amazing company.

I just hope everyone I know will last longer than me so I won't have to say goodbye but then if that happened, I wouldn't be here much longer  I guess they should go first because they're older but I just don't wish death upon anyone. Sometimes when I really hate people like Erin, I really think I want them to disappear but then I think of their families and even though I don't care about the girl, her family never did anything to me so why should I wish her dead? Goodness I'm going into some really embarrassing things. I hope whoever reads this doesn't think I'm psycho or something. I'm not  or I don't think I am  I guess people with problems don't realize they have those problems. My shoulder is really aching from typing. it's the same shoulder that always hurts though.

‎I don't know what to feel or think. I am so overwhelmed with everything. I have felt this way for the past two weeks, but it just seems like it is all crashing today. I think partly because me and my roommate are going home tomorrow. I feel like I have so much to do before we leave. I have so much homework everyday, and so much with my sorority, and I just want to have time to hang out and take it all in. Not saying that I never have time, because I do, but not much. Anyway, today we signed for our apartment next year. Its so crazy that you have to do that this early here. But I am so excited about it. I'm living with my roommate, my suitemate, one of my pledge sisters, and both of her suitemates. it's going to be so awesome. So I had to pay that money today and in a couple of days, we have to pay like 600 dollars again, so that is a little crazy. I can't wait until I get used to this lifestyle and it all feels right. like I'm having a blast and everything, but I feel so busy. I missed my first class today because I was so behind on reading in another class. I'm hoping I can control myself with that and not miss too often. I feel so behind in most of my classes. three of my classes have been all reading, and that is so hard for me. I'm such a slow reader. I just need a weekend where I do nothing but homework and study, but I won't ever have that, because there's football here, and I like to have fun on the weekends. so, I love my sorority. They are all the sweetest group of girls. We have such an awesome pledge class. I'm living with one of my pledge sisters who I have become pretty close to her. I love her she is awesome. We had our pledge retreat last weekend, and I got to know so many more of the girls. I can't say too many good things about all of them. and I love the actives, too. The seniors have been so sweet to us. Our pledge trainers are the cutest things ever. I love going there and feeling so loved by everyone, it really is a comforting feeling in this crazy place. Anyone of them would do anything for us, and that makes me feel so good, and safe. Did I mention that I feel like I'm doing homework nonstop. haha. I really need to read tonight, I have to stay ahead. or rather get ahead. that is the one thing that I heard over and over again from college students: stay ahead on your work. I need to try harder to do that, because in high school I was such a procrastinator and I can't be like that here. I really need to do good, but does not everybody. especially since I want to get‎stream of consciousness‎0

‎now the computer is making noise. I wonder why it does that. I have always wondered what makes the computer make that noise. it sounds like it is computing data or something. like it is processing stuff. I guess that is what it is doing but I am not really that for sure. there it goes again. it always does that. oh well. who knows. my name is Quentin and I am in psychology 301 with Pennebaker. so far I have enjoyed his lectures more than any other teacher. I am not for sure if it is because I find psychology interesting thus far or if he is just good and / or interesting in his way of presenting the material. Either way I enjoy going to psy. more than any other. somebody just made a loud noise from the kitchen. now they are getting ice out of the freezer. water sounds good. I am starving too. I wonder what we are having at the Phi Gam house for lunch today. it better be good. I am starving. I have had a bad headache all day too. I hope it goes away soon. it is probably just because I haven't eaten lunch yet. I t will probably go away when i8 eat. it usually does. tonight I have a lot of homework to do. Chemistry is keeping me very busy. I had no idea that Chem204 was going to have so much busy work involved. my muscles are sore today. I wonder if I will play catch with Scott again today. it will probably be good for me if I do. it has been fun getting outside and doing stuff. the rain might keep us from doing it though. it has been raining just about everyday. I wonder when it will stop. it is supposed to be raining so much because of that storm down on the coast or whatever. I wonder of pres. Clinton is going to get impeached. that would be pretty crappy if he did, not that he doesn't deserve it. he should not have gotten with Monica Lewinsky like he did. that was really stupid of him. I can't think of a dumber thing that he could of done. I bet Hillary is pissed. that has got to be embarrassing. the cowboys looked good yesterday from what I saw. that sucked that I had to do some homework during it and couldn't just enjoy the game. I wonder how long Aikman will be at he is supposed to be out for 4 to 8 weeks. I think that they will still do good without him though. it sucks that he is gone though, he is awesome. I never knew he went to UCLA until this weekend when they said it during the Horns v. UCLA game. I wish we would have won that game, but I really didn't expect us to. we played awesome in the second half. I hope that is caries over to the Kansas St. Game. if we would win that game it would‎stream of consciousness‎0

It comes to me that I would very much like to make a superb grade in all my classes. I think that perhaps I shall if I apply myself. I am glad to think that I can do well in school. My thoughts now focus around a girl in my philosophy class who has the cutest face I think I've ever seen. I am trying to figure out a way to talk to her. I think it will have to be classrelated. There are two other girls in that class that I think are attractive. The class itself is very fun as well. I have a lot of work to do this weekend. I suppose I should get straight to it when I get home from class today. Damn, I have to work out. I used to dislike working out because of the physical discomfort, but now it's merely an issue of time. Time is the one commodity I am exceedingly greedy with. I am now thinking about how to best manage my time this weekend. I am more or less caught up in this psychology class; I now have more time to work on the others. I think I will get caught up on reading in English, and then turn in my paper. I paused for a moment there in my writing. I was thinking about what it was I was going to do today in the gym. I realized it was leg day. Leg day is excruciating, but short. Oh well, I will live. My thoughts wander back to women. I would very much like to get better acquainted with all kinds of women on a casual level. I need to expand my pool of female friends. Even as we speak, a plan of action comes to mind. School makes it easy to meet new people. I simply have to turn off my shyness. I paused AGAIN in my writing. I was thinking about the study section in computer science I was about to go to today. The TA in that study section speaks very poor English. I will go because I understand the code he puts on the board enough that I am well ahead of his thinking during that hour. The other students are not so fortunate. I figure that they'll survive. The class is a breeze. It is not very challenging, unfortunately, but I am learning a bit. """"Easy Learning I call it.

‎have very short patience. I like to take care of my business and get going on to the next. Time can be very crucial sometimes. When I'm late to class I wish I had more time to take are of all my stuff before I have to head out but other time when I have too much time on my hands I wish I had some chores to do or homework, despise the fact that homework can be a killer sometimes. I don't like the way this apartment is never the right temperature. It is always too cold or always too hot. It is never the right temperature. I think its because all of the rooms in this apartment are at different angles so they get cold and hot and different rates so my roommates and I always change the temperature on the thermostat according to how we each want it. Oh well I guess that's the way it works. I just looked at the timer and I have a minute or so left so now I'm thinking about time and going totally blank on my other thoughts. It's nice to randomly talk about different stuff. It's unusual but good writing assignment. Kinda funny that I sat here and typed away for a good twenty minutes, and I just got stopped so I guess that's it. ‎stream of consciousness‎0

For some reason I played pretty good today, I usually don't play that good. I'm not really sure what to write, well I mean type. I went to a sorority date dash last night. It was pretty fun. They rented out some club on sixth street. I saw some people that I went to highschool with, and I didn't get home until about three so I'm really tired . I really doubt that I'll stay out that late tonight. Tomorrow I'm going to san Antonio for the beastie boys concert with these girls that I don't really know that well. I hope everyone has a good time. The next day is my grandpa's birthday and my entire family is going to meet at our ranch in Gonzales. That reminds me I have to get him a gift. I'll get him something from ut of course probably a hat or something. My suitemates went home this weekend, one lives in Arlington the other lives in deer Park. they are pretty cool guys. Sometimes they get on my nerves but I'm sure I get on people's nerves too. My roommate is going to a church thing right now. He said that the people there are really nice but they are extremist about how they worship, I think it makes him feel uncomfortable, I can relate I've been to some church functions like that. But he is also going because he met some girl there so he is getting the best of both worlds learning about god and hooking up with a girl. I WISH I COULD OF GONE.

‎"""As I sit in this library for the first time in my entire life, I feel as if I don't belong here, in this setting. I'm not usually the completely studious type so I'm just trying this library thing out. It's really deathly quiet and I'm not used to the absolute silence that surrounds me. I feel quite rude as my typing is unusually loud in this setting. I hope people around me aren't annoyed by this """"tapping"""" as I am. I'm sitting alone in the corner, but at least I'm next to the window. I picked this spot as to not go completely crazy and be bored. People watching is fun. it's interesting to me how every single person walking around outside has their own story, their own point of view and I often wonder how different it is from my own. I haven't had any quiet time or alone time to myself since I've moved up here to Austin and just now, I realize that I indeed do miss it. I think I'll visit the library by myself a lot more often from now on. next time, I should remember to bring a jacket; I feel like I'm turning into a humansicle. but I don't like walking all the way from my dorm to here. it's quite a walk. I really should learn how to use the bus system here. I'm used to having the comfort of my car. the comfort I've had for four years. I miss it. I went home this weekend, the very first weekend after school started. it's not because I missed home or I was homesick or anything. I've been away from home for much longer periods of time and have never even thought about home much. like this summer, my 5 weeks overseas, I don't think I even thought about my family or home-life all that much. As horrible as that sounds, I'm not the type to miss my family or anything. anyway, I just went home this weekend because I felt that my dorm room was too bland and I wanted to bring up more stuff. I ended up coming back up to school with a huge suitcase and three boxes worth of crap that I should have thrown away. instead, this wonderful crap adorns my newly decorated dorm room walls and desk area. it looks so much better. I also got a new webcam. my mother had one at home that I wanted to bring up but she said she used it a lot so she ended up buying me another one. My mother's a funny person. She came to the states during her college years about 20-something years ago. I wonder how her college experience was. It must have been hard. I can imagine living in a country where no one understands what the heck you're saying. I've experienced it. still, she managed pretty well, I suspect. she's just that type of person. she has a really strange accent though in her English.

‎the conversation will last for a lifetime. Or I guess I should say it will last for a long time. It's amazing how I was here in my room for so long by myself without my roommate or suitmate, and then all of a sudden it's like they both appeared at the same time, and within five minutes they both left and I'm left alone again in quietness. I will most definitely take advantage of that alone/quiet time, but then again sometimes I do get bored sitting here by myself. They asked me if I wanted to go eat with them but I just ate a few hours ago, I might as well save my meals for when I'm actually hungry right?  Wow, looking up at the clock I never realized how long twenty minutes really is. I feel almost out of breath because I've been typing so much so fast and its only been a mere ten minutes. My  sister just called but I have to call her back. She didn't seem to mind because she said that her and her friend Jessi would be searching for Jessi's car anyway. So I wonder what happened to it?  Did she park somewhere and forget where she left it?  Weird. I hope I never do that. Although it would probably be hard for me to do that since I've only driven my car twice in two weeks. I wonder if that's bad for it?  Maybe I need to try to drive it at least once a week to make sure it still works?  I should probably ask my dad about that. So its only four oclock in the afternoon and I feel like its ten at night. Why is that?  Well I just hope I keep up with everything as much as I'm """"supposed"""" to because college is definitely not like high school. High school is like a joke compared to what I've experienced in only 5 days. Oh well at least we get a month of for winter break instead of two weeks. So about winter break. I cannot wait to go home because I think we will have like a reunion of everyone getting to be together once again. I'm sure Ill see most of my friends over Thanksgiving break but the first time we will all be together with the """"old gang"""" will probably be Christmas break. That will be a fun break, and I know it will be great seeing everyone again. I wonder if my family will be taking any kind of of trip?  Hmmm there's another thing I need to check into because I don't like finding out about things like that at the last minute. Especially since my best friend who lives in Virginia will be in Houston for part of the break. If I missed her because I was on a family trip I would be extremely upset so I need to figure it out to make sure I will be around. Wow my eyes are‎stream of consciousness‎0

You can do all sorts of things in twenty minutes that are enjoyable such as play guitar (which I don't) or scuba or imagine you are climbing mount everest and even if you don't do any of these things it is fun to pretend to do so. I normally am happy that I type very fast but now I'm realizing that since this is timed that will be a disadvantage to my fingers which hurt sometimes after I type for a long time, maybe I'm too old for this type of exercise. Its possible. Anyways, only two minutes have passed and this doesn't seem to be going anywhere. While we are on the subject of contractions in the English language, I noticed that I haven't been putting apostrophes in all of my contractions and that would probably make English teachers spin in their graves but it doesn't really bother me because I am a double EE/physics major and don't have to take any English classes ever ever hahaha, oh sorry, got the best of me, anyways where was I? I like orchids, they are the coolest flower. And that reminds me of that chinese art with the brushes where they use really dark ink to make the branches of trees or limbs of bushes and then really bright red or other color to make the petals of the flowers. The thing I like about those is that they don't have any leaves and I really wish I could do that art as they could. And now a whopping five minutes has passed and I am 1/4 done with this assignment and I don't know how I can possible continue writing this fast for that long but I guess I will have to endure, because if the Romans could withstand years of constant battle and such things (I don't want to pick the right word that would be a sign of conscious thought and we don't want that right now for this exercise (I hope I'm spelling that right)) where was I, you if the Romans can withstand all that battling and make all their cool things with limited resources then the LEAST I can do is write this for twenty measly minutes which really isn't that long and I'm thinking I could leave this here and say I'm a slow typist but that would be morally wrong and would be grounds for going to the effigy of fiery hell that is ruled by Satan and I don't know why I'm talking about this because I am not religious at all and the reason that is is because (is is is not good to use in a sentence, especially not is is is) sorry, anyways the reason I'm not religious is because of my scientific type of mind and even though my parents are religious (although not devoutly or anything) I still have‎stream of consciousness‎0

‎It's been almost a week since I have moved to Austin to study. There have been times when I miss home, as well as times when I call my dorm room home. I don't understand why exactly I am here. None of this makes any sense. I've grown up, studying at a small school, small church, small community type settings, and I've thrown myself into the largest university in the nation, surrounded by many diverse students of all kinds. My friends have made the transition easier, as well as comforting. However, there's still a little void inside of me. Where did it come from though? I see that naturally, God has some sort of plan for me here. But as of now, I have not a clue. No reason, no rhyme. And here I am writing my psychology assignment on the day it was assigned. This never happens. I am the one who's lazy and always procrastinates to the last possible second before even lifting a finger towards any assignment handed my way. Yet, I feel like a change is about to occur. A transformation possibly, from a cocoon to a butterfly so to say. Leaving behind the old, and embracing the new as it comes my way. I look around my desk, seeing my personal belongs as it reflects my own personality, my soul, my spirit. And I realize, that I'm lacking. I have my mere clothing, and books for my classes, my computer. The only thing that resembles anything about myself is my Jars of Clay poster, given to me by a friend. This poster is the only tangible object, image to represent myself. Do I lack a soul, or have I yet to express it in a more productive manner? Why am I even writing about this anyway? Why did I begin writing this so early? Regardless of it all, I know that He has a plan for my life. Everything I do has a purpose for the sake of His glory. Whether people acknowledge His existence or not, He is still there and is all powerful. Two plus two is four, never five. God is here, and always will. People can choose to ignore Him, but His existence still remains. I miss my Youth Pastor, Gary, who taught me to seek God with everything I have. He was the kind of man who'd parents would approve of as a personal mentor. His wisdom and knowledge of every concept in the world baffles me, and kept me curios. But it's his compassion that I miss the most. The tears he shed, when he heard of a young boy committing suicide because his peers perpetual teasing. The affectionate, unconditional love he expresses towards his wife and children. These things, I miss the most. But the one true divine aspect about Gary, is that he's a man of God. A man who sought after God without ever holding back. He dove in. Not caring where or how, when or why, he dove in. Will mankind ever see a man like‎stream of consciousness‎0

‎so confused, and it makes me feel so stupid, because it is just Pre-Cal!  So, today I went to the University of Texas Learning Center, and it really seemed to help. I think out of my class of thirty, there was three of us at that moment in there. So that already says enough about our teacher. Also, I emailed him about it, and he made me feel even stupider. I mean if he wants respect from me, then he needs to respect me!  He told me he couldn't pat my hand to make me feel better, etc. , and I was like, yeah, but you could try and teach us, instead of going over 8th grade algebra!!!  But oh well, I am trying to fix everything!  I just decided that I am going to be on top of all my studies, and try to keep up on the reading and all my math homework. I hope that I never forget about any important tests, or assignments, or papers. I am super glad I am in a FIG, because hopefully that will help. I am just super horrible with tests, because I have a major test anxiety. That would explain my horrible SAT score. But whatever, it is all good, I mean look, I made it to UT, didn't I~!  Well, since psychology is my major I hope this class keeps me super interested so I don't switch majors like five times, like every other college student!  I just want to know what I want to do with my life, besides marry my sweetie, and be successfull with my family and money. But, so far, I am so glad I have chosen UT, because I absolutely love it, and even though there have already been those times when I have felt so fat, or so overloaded with sorority stuff or reading( which I am also very slow at!), i know everything in the end will turn out just how it is supposed to, because God is here carrying me through out all my good times and my bad!  I just hope I can figure out this pretesting thing, because that would be awesome if I didn't have to do five hours worth of experiments, ya know!! ‎stream of consciousness‎0

‎     Ok. just got done crying because of stupid high school people I never want to talk to again. The shaking of my hands is making this a little harder to do than normal. I hope I don't misspell too many things. I am sniffingly so loud. I should go get a tissue. I never did learn how to type right on this thing. Why did my thoughts just totally flip?  Wow, that's weird. Brain is slowly losing it's ability to function properly after the realization of how bad my mind jumps topics. I really wish I could concentrate for more than 2 seconds when I'm emotional. It really sucks to cry and have to put everything else off until I can see straight. But I won't be crying any more hopefully as I am cutting off those jerks from high school. I don't need than, nor do I wan them in any aspect of my life. They just make things complicated because they are sick and deranged people with nothing better to do than mess with me. Wow, London tell them how you really feel!  I hate computers when I have fake nails. I always hit a random button and end up typing a couple of lines up in a sentence that is already done. My back hurts really bad from sitting up on the ground. I think it's time to switch positions. Ah. Much better. Now my typing skills really stink. It's really hard to lay on the ground and type. Oh I have a laptop. That would be stupid to do if I had a regular PC. I still can't get comfortable. The floor isn't exactly rock hard, but it's no fluffy bed. That's better. I don't know why I didn't get on the bed in the first place. AHHH!!  Yes, I do I don't want to be on my white comforter!!  Oh no!!  You know writing this is turning out to be a lot harder than it should be. You would think that all this movement would not have to happen, but not with me. Stupid back gives me problems all the time. I miss Dr. Jones!!  I don't know how I'm going to make it not going to get adjusted whenever I hurt. It just occurred to me that I might be using AIM abbreviations in this writing thing. That might not make me look too smart. Oh, well. I don't want to go back and look at it. It would just take to long. God, my nose is still stopped up. My skin is drying out to. I need to wash my face and moisturize. I forgot how to spell moisturize!!!

I finally took some Tylenol at about 4am this morning and I woke up later sweating, so I hope that means I broke the fever. Now I just have this stupid cough to worry about. I hate coughing because it hurts my throat. I need to call my voice teacher and tell her I can't come to lessons today because I'm sick. Which sucks because I haven't had a lesson in forever. And she's the best teacher I've ever had. I guess keeping the extra money is good. Ugh. I'm coughing again. It sucks. My dog is looking out the window. I have a lot of studying that I need to do today. I need to catch up on a bunch of stuff so that I hopefully can go to Dallas tomorrow to see Sister Hazel in concert again. But I seriously don't know if I'll be able to go since I'm sick. I'm on medicine, so hopefully getting another round in me today will help. Goodness this stupid clock is going so slow. I've only been typing for 4 minutes. I think 20 minutes is a bit excessive. There's not even a pause button. What is I have to go to the bathroom or someone comes to the door. Seriously. Plus, I want to lay down. I want to get something to eat and take my medicine. I need to call my voice teacher. So, I want to go to Dallas this weekend but I also want to stay to go to some stuff that's going on down here. Mostly because the guy I have a crush on will be there too. And he's been giving me very mixed signals lately. Which is so frustrating. I don't know what to think or how to act around him. I'm trying to act almost aloof, as if I don't care. Part of me thinks he's just toying with me to stoke his own ego. And I refuse to play into anyone's ego. I don't want to get hurt. It sucks. And this cooler weather is reminding me of couples. Being able to snuggle and all that. Not that I've ever had that. I'm 22 and I've never had a boyfriend. Which is OK. I don't define my self worth by a guy or if I've had a boyfriend or not. But sometimes I do think it world be nice. But it's whatever God has planned for me. If He thinks I'm not ready, then I'm not ready. I need to start spending more time with God. Just get my focus back on Him. So many things have happened these past few weeks and I feel that they've all been for a reason. And I'm graduating in December and I have no idea what I'm going to do. I'm excited and terrified at the same time. Will I‎stream of consciousness‎0

I kind of regret not going to boston college though. that was my dream. that was my huge sigh of relief after high school. that was the product of 12 years of overachieving.

Maybe I'll go get some as soon as I finish this assignment. My room mate seems to be frustrated right now. I just heard her sigh. She has a test tomorrow that she needs to study for. She is mad because we weren't able to get football tickets for the OU game in Dallas. I kind of wanted to go and was getting excited about going to it. The television just mentioned something about getting pizza. Now my craving for it is increasing. I can taste it now. It's hard to type for 20 minutes straight. The phone just started ringing and distracted my train of thought for a while. My room mate just left the room to go open the door. I can watch the television from where I am sitting in front of my computer. My room mate's brother just walked in. Now all I can think about is what he is saying and I can't arrange my thoughts now. I just gave my room mate's brother my graphing calculator and showed him how to use it. I can't think of what to type any more. I am quickly running out of ideas. Time is passing really slowly. Typing for 20 minutes is really hard. My room mate is still talking about the OU football tickets. She is getting rid of her wristband and now I am thinking how I need to take mine off too. What other homework do I have?  I don't feel like going to my calculus class tomorrow. It is the most boring class I have because all we do is work out problems. I should go to the discussion session today, but I would rather go shopping with my friend. I keep sniffing. I still wish I could breathe. I think that not being able to breathe is the most annoying thing in the world. I feel as though I want to chop off my nose just so I don't have to feel congested any longer. Is this feeling normal?  Wanting to chop off my nose?  Everytime I get congested I feel the exact same way. Now I am starting to think that there is something wrong with me for wanting to chop off my nose. Oh well, I bet it is a perfectly normal feeling when you are sick and frustrated. I wonder what caused me to become congested. I heard that a lot of people have been sick today.

‎    I am so nervous about what I got on my economics test. I know that I spent a long time studying, but I will be very upset if I don't get at least a B. I can't wait till next weekend when I get to go to Lubbock to visit Ryan. I hope that the Chili Cookoff will be fun. It sounds like it will be entertaining. I am upset that I am not going to get to Sara, though. I wish I could go to Lubbuck this weekend, but I have two tests on Monday. I am so stressed out about those test. I am going to spend a lot of this weekend studying. After I get those test out of the way I need to spend a lot of time on my english paper. I feel like I can never get caught up. I am looking forward to the Phi Psi mixer tongiht. I hope that I can meet some really nice guys. Actually, I don't care if I meet nice guys or not, I am just looking forward towards getting to go out. Lately I feel like all I ever do is study. College is so much more stressful than high school because you don't know what to expect. I am not sure if I am studying enough. At least I will be able to tell after I receive my grades from all of these tests. I am so tired. I wish I could take a nap. Hopefully after class I will have time to eat, workout, and take a nap. I am really upset that I haven't had much time to work out lately. When I was in high school I had cheerleading practice everyday. I was always working out. Now the only thing my body is use to is walking around to all my classes. It makes me feel so out of shape. Britany Spears is the best. I am listening to her CD right now. I had so much fun at her concert. It was weird to actually see her in person. I am so glad that I have been understanding my Calculus lately. At first I was worried that I was going to have to drop the class. I am glad that I decided to stick with it, because now it isn't so bad. The only part that sucks is the homework. It takes forever to do because the questions are so tedious. I am really nervous about completeing the test in 50 minutes. I can barely do one problem in 20. Hopefully they won't be as hard as the homework problems. I am praying that they are a lot more general. I hope that Ryan and I have time to talk tonight. It seems like I am always busy with Zeta new member functions and he is always busy with his rush stuff. It will be  a good thing for me to be able to see him. I need to figure out which airport to fly out of.‎stream of consciousness‎0
‎"""I like to hear music. For some reason, I recently discovered old rock, specifically the group Pink Floyd. Their songs evoke strange feelings of relaxation within me. Why though? I suppose the smoothness of the words accompanied by the awesome guitar. I am reminded of the lyrics """"so do you think you can tell, Heaven and Hell, Blue skies from pain, can you tell a green field, from a cold steel rail?  A smile from a veil?  Do you think you can tell?. cold comfort for change. how I wish you were here, were just two lost soles swimming in a fish bowl, year after year, running over the same old ground, but have we found the same old fears, wish you were here. """" --Pink Floyd's song """"Wish You Were Here. """"      I find myself relaxed yet down though. I am disturbed somewhat from the words; but, why am I feeling relaxed. I think it is from the awesome music and pitch of the singer's voice. Their exotic, at least to me, beginning seems to subliminally evoke depth of thinking even though the words may seem stupid. But, the part of the song I enjoy the most is the fishbowl analogy. I think it is ingenious and I am reminded of myself and my inability to find the right girl of my dreams. For some reason, the analogy portion evokes a sort of chivalric ambition within me. I desire a bit of love and romance from a special person that I want to meet. the perfect girl. Someone with the same aspirations as me. A person that when I look into her eyes I find myself lost. Yet, physically, the act of looking into her eyes would have no physical affect to me in the real world. silly.      Anyway, I am aware that Pink Floyd took drugs and were possibly high while writing this song. I do not condone to taking drugs. In fact I dispise drugs. They ruin lives and for what. So you can loose your mind for a couple of minutes and kill yourself. The best way to counter drugs is not to try them at all. Abstinence from drugs and getting drunk is the best things in life, at least I think so. I don't need to get myself drunk at a party to have a good time. I just need to go regularly and I will have an awesome time. I am reminded of a party I went to a few weeks back. This is a disco party where you dance with girls. I went to the party and was dancing and having a good time. Unfortunately, the other guys needed to get drunk to dance. So, they all went outside to get drunk and came back in. They were the biggest loosers I have ever seen in my life. I suppose they don't have enough self esteem to go out and dance with the girls. Unfortunately, I feel that I miss out‎stream of consciousness‎0

‎ I sure am glad to get this out of the way. I really enjoy all of my new classes but by math Professor is really hard to understand. I miss Jenny so much and ca not wait until this weekend when I get to see her. This typing stuff and I don't get along very well but that�s why I have voice activated word processor. I talk and it types everything that I pronounce. I really don't think that fifteen hours on the first semester of school was a very good idea. I have absolutely no free time. I have PHL, PSY and RHE so I am reading all the time. At least I have a few good friends in most of my classes. I need to get my head back in school though because right now it is still in summer. All the information I receive in lectures simply goes in one ear and out the other. I hope my Mom is doing better. I left her alone all by herself when I moved to college. Wow, this is a really elementary level paragraph,   Ehh, O well.   So I wonder if its true that guys can blank out and be thinking about nothing, no literally nothing and girls always have thoughts flying through their heads. If it�s true the girls papers should be some what longer than the guys unless of course the girl cannot type very well (like me). I really wish I could decide on a major soon but if not I know everything will be just fine. The only thing I would like to have more of is free time. I have no free time to get my mind off of the books. Hopefully that will come soon. I�m getting pretty tired of riding the capital metro to and from school I really need to see about a dorm room for next semester but for sure next year. I feel like I am writing diary or something, actually it's quite relaxing and stress relieving. I need to see about going to my chem. and math's professor�s office hours. Well I�m thinking so hard on what to write about that I am drawing a blank, I think its the small amount of sleep I have been acquiring. I wonder if my cars AC will be fixed tomorrow like they said but then again they said it would be today and I'm still with out a car. It's very hard not to use   IM   language on this and abbreviate everything. By the way I suck at spelling so sorry if anyone reads this other than me. I wonder what all the goop is inside my lava lamp is made of?  I don't know but I do know that my Chem. professor wouldn't know because he have a hard enough time trying to teach my class of 500 the chemistry basics. Sweet it's already over, man that was fast, too bad it's not like that in class. ‎stream of consciousness‎0
‎"""Here I sit wondering just what to write that involves my stream of consciousness, which shouldn't be too hard. Writing for me is usually pretty easy, however this assignment seems to be particularly hard. Maybe because I feel partially tired and torn down from my long day. I am looking forward to tomorrow because Thursdays are probably my easiest days because I will not have to wake up at the usual 9am and oh yeah it is also one day closer to the weekend!  Although I have to say that 9am is also a lot better than 8am, which was time I had to arrive at school during my high school days. Since high school just popped into my mind, I have to say that college is a major leap from high school. Despite the fact that it is more enjoyable it also is a lot more stressful. For instance, leaving your family, friends, and so forth behind. Not to mention your adolescence. I am happy to say that the transition for me has ran pretty smoothly although the major bumps are yet to come. One of my """"bumps"""" that I am experiencing is the massive amount of reading involved, at one point I enjoyed reading but maybe that is because the reading is not usually my preferred choice. Another obstacle is that it it is your choice whether to read or not, in fact it is just another realization that I am out in the real world and everything is based upon my choices. I find that very scary, yet also very exciting in a positive way because I can make my future what I want it to be.  """‎stream of consciousness‎0

My biggest fear besides dying is turning into her and yelling at my kids like she yelled at me. I don't know why my dad still loves her and how he can put up with it, it is not normal how she talks to him or me sometimes. She doesn't understand why I don't want her around my friends or my boyfriend but its because I don't want her to turn into that other person and yell at me in front of them because it really is frightening. My friend Matt just came over to distract me and prevent me from getting an A on this assignment which seems to have no real purpose, but maybe it will after I finish and turn this in. ‎stream of consciousness‎0

I'm also very mad because my girlfriend is being a real you know what, and she knows she is doing it and she just won't cut it out. Unfortunately, I live with her and I have to put up with this day in and day out. We also have a daughter together and at this time she is crying and crying and she won't let me concentrate at all. I just feel a lot of anger inside me, that is just waiting to come out. I'm ready to explode!  Right now all I am hearing is my baby daughter crying and crying, and I am also listening to the Cowboys play the Texans. I'm trying to watch the game while I am doing this, but it is impossible. My mind keeps on going blank while I am doing this. I have no idea why, my mind is just going blank. I think that I may be going crazy at this time. At this time, I am also getting sick because of this weather. I got a stuffy nose and I cannot smell a thing. My throat is killing my also. It hurts and it's hard to eat anything. I wouldn't be sick if it wasn't for this weather. I'm thinking about a lot of different things right now. My mind keeps on going back to how I would be in a whole different situation if I was still in school and if I would not have gotten my girlfriend pregnaut. I love my daughter, but I don't think that I was quite ready to be a parent so early in my life. My girlfriend, well she just makes me mad all the time and she makes my life become more and more stressful. Sometimes I just want to leave her, but I can't see my life without her. I love her, but she just needs to change some of the things that she does. She also needs to learn how to cook!  My eyes keep on moving and I keep on noticing this small little chair that we have that is decorated with clouds. The clouds are white and the background is a baby blue. I could stare at that chair forever because I love the color baby blue so much. Right now my girlfriend is washing dishes and all I can hear is myself typing and the water running. My baby finally stopped crying and she is falling asleep. I just noticed that the cowboys are losing to the texans which doesn't make me very happy either. I like the cowboys more than any other team, but unfortunately they don't have a very good quarterback. I wish that one day I could be the head coach of the cowboys. Maybe someday.

I just don't have the drive to do anything, but i know that i need to get good grades.  I am enjoying my classes this fall much more than the ones that I had this summer. they are actually things that I am interested in and my proffessors are weird or mean like the ones that I had to deal with in the summer semester here. I absolutely love UT, i don't think that there is any way that I could have stayed at home much longer. I'm to the point now that it is really weird whenever i go home and i don't like it very much. I have even started to call austin home. This really bothers some of my friends, mainly the ones who still like back in keller or around keller. I miss my parents a lot and i fell bad that I dislike being at home. I love my mom so much and i worry about her because i know that she is sad. I love my dad too, he and my mom are my favorite people in the whole world and i don't know what i would ever do without them. I feel that i am a disappointment to them though. I am nothing like my sister and i don't have half the book smarts that she does. She got all the intelligence and i got all the common sense, which isnt good when you are going to a school like UT. I love my sister a lot, i just don't know if she likes me that much. We have always had to deal with a lot of sibling rivalry. and you would have thought that it had gotten better but it is just so hard for us to talk sometimes. i think that she is amazing though and i look up to her so much. Right now, I am rally worried about my friend, his dad died not long ago, and i don't know how he is doing. He drinks and smokes all the time and one of his roomates and i are really worried, but it hasnt reached the point where we can say anything to him yet.

‎I try not to talk about him around Caitlyn, Jake's little sister. When he died she was in 4th grade. They were so close. I remember it all like it was yesterday. Getting the call at 6 the next morning. I had seen hi that Sunday night that he died at church and I remember him giving me that half smile that he did and me melting along with the rest of the girls in youth group. I talked to Catilyn about it for the first time this summer since it happened when she was in fourth grade. She broke down one night in Montana when we were on mission tour. We were all sharing what something meant to us and several people ended up relating it to their siblings. She just broke down which was a first. I talked to her and told her that I hated talking about Seth around her because Jake and him were the same age. She said that she loved hearing about Seth but she just wished that she had an older brother so badly. She said it like any other person who had never had a brother would say it. My brother is getting married this summer. It is so strange. I love Lauren. She is already just like my sister. They have been together for four years now. At first I was so jealous because I felt like she was taking my place as my brother's best friend. I soon realized that we had very different places in Seth's life and that there is room for both of us. I have Seth' past and we both have his future. My Family and I used to drive to our cabin in east Texas and have the best time. Seth and I would play so hard. On the way down we would always eat at the same fast food place and get burgers and icecream. Seth would always comment on the fresh air as soon as we got out of the car in the woods. It's funny what a family thinks is so humorous that would mean nothing to others. On the way down he would always try to explain the wonders of the earth to my mom and me like the stars and solar system and physics and things that Ginny and Anne Claire Hickman would probably never grasp. That's one thing I adore about my family. We all contribute different things. We are so different but so alike. I miss days of being with just us. We always traveled a lot. I think I'm just trying to let go of that time in my life right now. With me leaving for college and Seth getting married, it's a whole new chapter. We have the best traditions. Even food traditions like Chicken and Cheese soup on Christmas Eve and Asparagus on Easter. I hope to start traditions with my own family. I miss my room, my bed, my church, the familiarity of Ft.

Maybe there is, but I doubt it. If true love is more than just a friendship, that means it involves chemistry and passion, but that stuff fades, it always fades. So what is to separate a strong, passionate friendship with true love?  Fucked if I know. All I know is, things are really looking up for me now.

‎Let's see. I'm sitting here in my dorm room all alone. This is a great time to get some homework done before my roommate comes back. Not that she's not a cool person or anything, I just can concentrate better when I'm alone and when it is quiet. But that is almost impossibe here in Jester. There are always people roaming the halls making loud noises. Like right now!  Oh well, it is something I must get used to. Or I can do what I did last night. Wait until around midnight to go to the study lounge located on this floor to get my reading done. I stayed there until 1:30 a. M. I guess I can do my work better at night. My fingers are freezing!  This room is so cold!  I haven't even figured out how to change the temperature in this room, it is insane. I'm cold even when I go to bed at night with my blanket. I have to constantly keep a sweater on and I cannot wear shorts like I used to back at home. Aw, home!  I think I am starting to miss being at home. I called the house the other day and my 11-year old brother told me he misses me. This, ladies and gentlemen, is something that never occurs. I do go back home on Thursday night, but only so that I can get to the DFW airport Friday morning for my flight to Atlanta. I am competing in a sports tournament for my church. I am playing flag football and running track. Another cool thing about this weekend get away is that I get to see the guy I've been dating for less than a month. Well, I've known him for about 4 years, but we just started hanging out a lot after we did a children's camp for my church together. It's funny because he liked me after we were participants in a camp when we were about 13. I went to a dance with him after that, but only because I didn't want to be mean. He is exactly a year and 13 days younger than me. That was always an issue for me before, but for some reason, I really don't care anymore. He is the sweetest and funniest guy I have ever met. I actually just got out of a 3 year and 3 month relationship a month ago. Me and my ex-boyfriend decided that since we were both going off to college, we should take time apart and maybe date other people since he was my first and only boyfriend. A week after we broke things off, this new guy I'm dating told me he had feelings for me. I was so confused and didn't know what to do because I had just got out of a relationship and I was going to be moving to Austin in a few weeks. But I'm normally the uptight girl that can't let loose and enjoy myself. Because of that, I decided that‎stream of consciousness‎0

‎my wall to keep my company when i am lonely. I can't wait until she comes to college and i can hang out with her more often.   Many of my friends party often. Not necessarily drinking all the time, but they often do drink. I have yet to go to a party in the university. I hear about date rapes and terrible things like that which frighten me, so i try to stray from any parties like those. My roommate is a member of the Christians on Campus here at the university and i attended one of their meetings (welcome dinners). I must admit that at first i felt very welcome to the organization. I told a few of my close friends back in Houston that i was becoming involved in that organization. However, they told me that they had heard it was a cultish organization and that i should not become involved in such an organization. I looked up some literature about the organization and i was quite worried about being involved in such an organization.     I took a quick nap today between my 8 am and 12 pm classes. Right now there are fire inspections going on at the dorm. I  usually don't dream at all, but i did dream during this nap. I dreamnt that on three different occasions the fire inspectors came to Leroy's and my dorm room. On each occasion they found a violations (of course none of these existed, but were all fabrications of my dreams).  ‎stream of consciousness‎0

‎"""o. k, so now I'm writing for this assignment. I'm going to turn off the music I'm listening to. ok, all finished with that. it was bizarre love triangle by new order, I like new order. I like order in general. reminds me of the balance between chaos and order. I'm probably more into that than most people I know. I wonder if most people think about chaos and order. the fan above me feels good, generating wind. my neck has been hurting a little today because last night I ate it hard on the ground while riding my bike at night. I totally busted my ass. my foot slipped which made me lose my balance and I crashed sideways with bike still in between me. gave me a few bad strawberries and I hit my head pretty damn hard. for a split second my world was """"bamn"""" and multicolor. my front door opened, it was my mom probably watering the plants. this makes me comment on the fact that I still live at home, I still live at home. I'm nineteen though so it isn't a huge deal but I'd like to have my own place. but I don't have the money for that because I pay for my own tuition and books and expenses. that sucks. but I do feel good when I say that to other people, usually at work is when I do that. I work at a restaurant that also makes espresso drinks, it's called satellite cafe. I got promoted and got more hours making it feasible that I could work through college and not have to worry about loans. loans blow. there's the door again. I keep looking at the finish button right underneath this never disappearing text. seven min, six seconds. my dad just walked in and we had a """"how are you"""" exchange. things are going better with my parents and I. there was a time before ut,(I'm a transfer from acc)where I didn't really care much about things. probably because I wasn't being challenged, except from work which I enjoyed/enjoy. anyway, I was in with what the counterculture does when the norm of society isn't watching or around. the popular bob Marley type stuff. I have a need to use code, with this being a college assignment and all. although I wonder about the likelihood of this being read by someone that shouldn't, it's probably close to zero. I stopped writing to notice the spaces in between rows of words which goes diagonally from top left to top right. how interesting. internet, seven thirty seven pm. I wish I was done now. funny because I was looking forward to doing this, but I thought it would be more of a stop/start thought process. it seems like I'm just narrating my last couple of days. I was just rearranging myself to get more comfortable. and I am somewhat. wish I had my own place, privacy. being alone is nice at times. hmm, I have to write for an entire twenty minutes.

‎  So far I have been at UT for I guess 6 school days, and I can already feel myself slipping. School was so much simpler in middle and elementary school. Why can't I go back?  Let�s see. what did I do today?  I woke up around 2 (we have lives around here), and  was bugging my sister to take me to church. I haven't been there since I don't know how long, but I need to start going again. my ex-boyfriend called and I don't know how it made me feel. I want to be free of him and not have to deal with any of his problems. I don't want to desert him, but I don't know what he wants from me and what I can possibly do for him. it wasn't a really serious relationship and to tell the truth I have no idea what I was thinking when I went out with him. he's not my type at all and my parents would be so disappointed if they found out. thank goodness it's over already. I don't know how I feel about him. I would like to be his friend, but that's it, and I also don't know what he wants. isn't this depressing?  Guys. Don't they all suck?  I wrote my would-have-been-boyfriend in high school and for some silly reason I am still waiting for him to reply. I don't know what's wrong with me. Maybe things will work out in the next ten years or so. I get really tired and depressed when I think about my ex and I don't know what to do about it. I want to be his friend, but I know he wants more and I don't think I can offer him that. I need to ask him what he wants or rather expects from me. He comes from a broken home and has a LOT of problems that I don't want to deal with. He's from Port Arthur and asked me to come down for his birthday. Funny I was actually considering it. what's wrong with me?  I called my little sister (12 yrs. old) and she wasn't home. Neither were my parents. I think they are at my aunt's house eating as usual. they live in new orleans and I miss them a lot. I need to come back and visit and I don't think I can do that until Christmas vacation. that sounds a lot better than Christmas  break. It really bothers me that I didn't capitalize most of the words that should be capitalize, but I shouldn't be worried about that right?  I am so unenergized right now. I need to go jogging or something, but it is late. I can't believe Princess Diana died. Mother Teresa also died, yet she didn't get as much attention as Princess Di. So much has happened in my short 17 years life span. I can actually tell my kids that I was alive when Princess Di and Mother Teresa died.‎stream of consciousness‎0

‎I am so stressed out right now with all these school stuff. Today I was so frustrated with my course schedule because I needed a fine arts credit. At the beginning, I signed up for art history, but I just found out that the class didn't work out for me. I didn't want something that hard to deal with since I am not even majoring in art. Therefore, I decided to try the music department. I called in, and the lady who worked at the office told me that the music appreciation class was still opened. She told me to go all the way to the building MRH just to fill out the green card in order to add the class. So, I decided to drop my art history class right away. In the afternoon, I rushed over there. By the time when I got there, one of the lady told me that I needed to talk to the professor first before I could fill out the green card. Plus, the time of the class she offered me interfered with my original schedule. I was so upset about this when I left the building because I really needed one more class in order to be fill up my hours. When I got back to my dorm, I immediately called my college of education for help. The guy told me to go to see the advisors in the next morning. He also told me not to worry too much today about it. I knew I shouldn't drop my art history class that quickly. I should have waited to see if I could be added to another class. Right now, I consider to take piano as my fine arts credit during the next semester because I have a little knowledge with piano but I am required to sign up on the waiting list first. The class can only fill up 15 students. Instead of taking the fine art class in this semester, I decided to take chinese instead. Besides, I need a foreign language credit. Tomorrow I will need to see that professor to see if I am allowed to be in that class. Hopefully, I can. I have been worried about this over the whole day. I wish everything can work out fine tomorrow. ‎stream of consciousness‎0

‎     I'm brandom. I type very slow right Now I'm watching ht ranger game. I love sports. Along with music they dominanate my life. I love the dallas maverics stars cowboys burn, and the texas rangers. Microsoft worl has kill my ability to spell any word correctly.  I get terribly mad and depressed when  the cowboys or the mavericks lose. I think it is because they mean so much to me and i spend alot of my time devote to them. I will check the internet aboiut two ofr three times a day. As for music i love music My favorite band is blink 182. People say the sold out and that theeir music change. It did. But they also change drummers and producer. Enima of the state was different. But take off your pants and jacket is right where it should be. think peoplee hate whats popular. and they hate change. Band alway change because they grow more talented and shiot happen in there life. But anyway i love blink Even if they would put out a polka album that is very very very horrible i would still buy. YOu always stick by what you love. I think the cowvboys will win the rest of their games. if they lose next game then they will win the rest of those. They will always be my favorite team whether they are 0-16, 16-0 8-8 what ever. I feel the same way about the mavericks. The other fwd sport I like but not love.  I hate the map making bastard. I hate how it dallasFortworth but not fort worth dallas. Fort worth is a big city. I hat it when they only put dallas on the map. They will but clevland and mhashville bbut now fort worth. I alos hat abc, nbc and fox news because the news cast is all about dallas A fucking tornado has to hit fort worth to hear it on the news, but if an old lady's air condition breaks in Dallas the have live helicopter shit. I hCBS is base out of fw But they get an even dallas and fort worth news. I hate missouri because Grand pa simpson does. I hate Peple who say thing just to get a response. I love double stuff oreos. I only like apples out of fruits and potatoes out of vegtables. I've never had a strwberry or a salad. I have bad hand writing In the fourth grade my teacher said that they won't except my paper in the fifth grade. All my teacher in every grade always say that. I like chicken noodle soup.

‎welcome to your life, there's no turning back, even while we. we will . whatever. I don't know all the words to everybody wants to rule the world, but that's the song on the radio right now. I can't recall ever hearing a song that I didn't like on KGSR. I think that I'll stay in Austin this summer so that I can continue to listen to it. I really missed it last summer, when I didn't really do anything. no, adi can't check his mail. he needs to get his own computer, but then again, so do I. so back to the point, there isn't one, Adi is not impressed with my psychology assignment. he wants to check his mail. that is why he is bitter. he won�t leave me alone to concentrate on my stream of consciousness or however you spell it. Lyle is not a man. she is the only girl I've ever met named Lyle. Adi will not stop talking about her, I don�t know what his fascination is with her, except that she is very attractive and other things. but that's all I have to say about her, because she is just my very nice friend. I honestly don't care, adi. I�m not lying, I know exactly what my feelings are. adi needs to get the hell out of here. by the way, his real name is aditya, but Americans can't pronounce that. maybe he should go back to India. like tonight. I hate the commercials on KGSR though. which is why I keep a CD ready for the ten minute commercial times. red shirt Sara, as she's known, was talking about marriage today, I think. that's really scary, since she's only 18, and also because if she marries any one, it should be me. at least for a few days. and Karen hasn�t been around much, but she's kind of out of it anyway. rosy cheeks. Jason has large speakers for his computer. which don't really have any meaning for me, since I never play computer games or do other things with them. I only check my email obsessively, although I usually don't ramble as much, unless I'm emailing my friend Tara, who I tell alot of useless information to. my stream of consciousness is rather boring, as I've learned in past jobs. I've had to entertain myself before while working long hours with no one else around at non engaging tasks. I usually sing whatever song is on my mind until I want to kill myself. (not really-which I should mention since you are psychologists)it's just that these songs get on my mind and won't go away, and all I can do is sing them over and over again. also I sometimes translate them into French. it always seems like I've accomplished something after I've done that. twenty minutes is a long time to just type. at least I have the radio on to give me some sort of stimulation, something to type about. adi has since left the room, which is why what‎stream of consciousness‎0

‎Right now I fell very discouraged about all this college business. Everything is going wrong. My computer keeps screwing up and I don't know how the hell to fix it. I want to go home where I know where things are. I wouldn't have a computer problem if I were home. I have barely any friends here and nothing ever to do but to watch TV even though there is never anything good on. I miss my girlfriend, I wish I was home. I'm sick, my throat hurts, I feel trapped, I have too much crap to know what to do with and there's no room for it. I hate college right now. I don't see why people like it or why they keep going. I think I made a mistake by coming here, nothing is going right. I can't even eat when I want, I have to wait until a certain time or walk 2 miles. I'm tired and need to study but really don't want to. Why am I the one who is always getting screwed over? I want to throw my brand new 2700 dollar computer out the window because it's a piece of crap. I'm not even sure I should be at college. I'm incredibly stupid, I don't see how I got accepted here. I have the worst memory in the world which should help me out a whole lot here. I'm hungry but oops, there's nowhere to get food. I feel like crying all day for so many reasons.

‎So I am sitting here wondering why I am doing this assignment at this particular moment in time. I have lots of other assignments that I could be working on. I have Music Theory homework I need to do and Music History I need to study for. There seems to be so much that I have going on in my life. I am going to Palo Alto, California for the football game on Saturday. Fortunately I have packed and don't have to worry about that. Renee Zellwegger is on Jay Leno right now. I think she is going out with Jim Carrey. I bet it would be awesome to be a movie star or a comedian. All you have to do is make people laugh and do sitcoms every now and then. I wish I had done some sort of acting to try and learn how to do that. I bet I could have made some money doing that. It doesn't even seem THAT hard. One of my good friends dad just passed away. I always fear about that happening to my parents even more that I fear it happening to myself. Maybe it is the whole thing with my fear of being alone. I live at home and if my parents and sisters were not around, I would not like that. Plus, I just can't comprehend losing my parents. I really hate talking about that. And I don't like typing. I keep having to backspace every so often. I haven't counted, but I think I have done it about 25, 26 times. I don't know. It's like, I love to talk to people and stuff, but if I am carrying a conversation over the computer or typing a letter or whatever it really frustrates me. What time is it? I still have ten minutes. Geez, I didn't think I could write this much in just ten minutes. I'm not that entertaining. I met these two girls in class the other day. I think their names were Brandy and Stephanie? I don't know. But the one sitting next to me was VERY attractive. I wanted to ask her for her number. But I barely got her name. Maybe I can do that on Monday. She seemed pretty impressed that I was the Longhorn Band President though. That seems really odd to me. Band people are normally thought to be nerdy that is a typically stereotype, although I know some people that DO give some of us a bad wrap. That was two minute for that paragraph. I don't think I will ever make it to the end of this paper. At least I am having a little more fun actually, I take that back, I am actually HAVING fun writing this paper.

‎It is 11:30 in the morning. I had a nine o'clock class and I should still be asleep. Naureen should be home soon, I have to remember to tell her that the bank called. I don't think anyone should call before noon. I need to find something to wear tonight I wander if Naureen has anything I could borrow. I can't believe I'm still hungry I have been eating so much. I guess this is how people get their freshman fifteen. I wonder why housekeeping is here on Monday. I think that it would be better if they came on Monday every week. I don't really like getting up on the days I have a late class. I wish I knew what was wrong with my computer. I also wish I could fix it by myself. I wonder if Marty is going to call. I hope he had a good Birthday. Twentytwo sounds so far away but it seems like yesterday he was eighteen. I need to do other homework so bad and I need to make my bed and clean up the closet. I'm so glad I got a clean room mate. I don't think I could have lived with another slob. I wonder how Meagan is doing I should call her and ask if she misses having her own personal maid. 11:40 ten minutes to go. I'm so tired today. If Sten and Tavis come over tonight I'm never going to sleep. I guess sleep isn't that important. I need to talk to mom I wonder if she is still going to San Antonio? I want to see grandma an Aunt Sylvia but I don't know if I can handle a weekend with mom. I guess I can try to get along with her. I hope we go shopping I really need some winter clothes or I going to shiver my butt off all winter. It is cold in here right now but there is nothing I can do about it. The thing is already turned up as far as it will go I don't think it works. I think they only put the thermostat in each room so you think you have control because it is always cold. If the phone rings one more time I'm going to freak. My phone I so loud you can hear it all the way down the hall. It scares me every time it rings. Halloween will be here soon That and New years are the best holidays. I'm going to have to find a costume. Ok its been twenty minutes I'm going to sleep this was interesting and I don't feel like I wrote enough but these were my thoughts. ‎stream of consciousness‎0

‎Okay RIght now I'm so worried about many things. I  just don't know what I want out of my life I am just so confused. I know what I want to be but I'm just so worried about making the grades that all I can think about a lot is school. Which I guess is good because they say if you worry enough about it that you'll end up doing good. It's just so tough for me not to worry about everything because I'm know on my own and I have to prove to everyone that I can make it and I can be independent. All throughout my life I've strived for the moment when I can be on my own and not have my parents or anyone else holding anything over my head. Well if schools not enough to worry about I have all of this other stuff like my relationship's with my friends and guys in particular. For instance I came here to Austin with a boyfriend and not within two weeks I wanted to have an open relationship. When he came down to visit I was a complete bitch to him because I felt like I would have been missing out if I devoted all of my time to him. Anyways I know have found this totally awesome guy but the only problem is he is 24 years old and well I'm 18 and I think it's okay but I don't know exactly how he feels about it. I don't think he thinks to badley of it because he took me out on a date and he's invited me out again. But I can't help but think it is because I'm young and he thinks he can have his way with me. And I know he is really nice and such a great guy but I'm just so suspiciuos of all the guys up here because were in a big college town and a lot of the guys can only think about getting one thing!  Then also my ex-boyfriend keeps calling me from Japan because he's in the Marines and he still fantazsies that we are going to get back together when he gets out. And I can't help but be nice to him or anyone else for the main fact that down the road of life who knows who your going to need a favor from. ‎stream of consciousness‎0

‎my mom to tell her that I love her. My family is the most important thing in the world to me and if I lost any of them I don't know how I could even go on. When it was over, two huge beams of light shone up from the back of the capital building to represent the twin towers. It made me think about the pictures I had seen from ground zero of the towers of light they had there. A very powerful sight. The man who was talking over the microphone said that the two huge lights that were shining behind the capital were both there in Pearl Harbor on December 7th. That was an amazing thought to me also. It was also very symbolic to show that the two lights had managed to withstand something that horrible and are now representing hope after another great American tragedy. However, this was a tragedy but not just that. In fact, it brought america closer than it has been in a really long time. I saw a commericial that gave me the chills. It was a video shot of a row of normal looking houses in a normal looking American city. The voice in the background said   On September 11, 2001, terrorists tried to change America forever.   The screen faded out, and then it slowly faded back in. The same houses were there but this time every house had like 5 or 6 american flags around it. In the yard, in the windows, hanging from the roof, just everywere. The voice said   They succeeded.   I think that is a perfect way to say what September 11 has done for America. Yea, so many people lost their lives, but people in AMerica are showing pride that they haven't shown in a long time. At this point in my life, I am VERY PROUD TO BE AN AMERICAN. ‎stream of consciousness‎0

‎I hear about every freakin day of my life. Oh well, nothing I can do about that. I really want to meet some more people. I have been here about two weeks and I have not really met that many people, which is kind of sad.  I am used to having a lot of friends and a lot of friends to do stuff with all the time, and for the first time in my life I do not have a lot of friends and it is kind of depressing. I mean I have no trouble meeting people or even talking to random strangers, but when it comes to really becoming someone friend I am having a harder time than I thought I would. I know that I just need to give it some more time, I can not expect to make everlasting friends within two weeks. I give out that advice to a lot of people, but I do not ever really listen to the advicec myself. Wow, I have like seven minutes left and my left hand is really starting to cramp up and it is getting harder and harder to type as each secong passes. I really wish that this would just end. When you are told to type about what is going on inside your head, you really have trouble. I usually do not have any trouble telling people about things I think about. . Oh my gosh this is so random, but last night around four in the morning or something like that, I woke up with a major cramp in my left calf. It hurt so incredibly bad. I tried walking, but I couldn't. It hurt so bad that I was crying until it went away. Even though it only lasted a short period of time, the time that it did last was torturous. Anyways, back to the analization of how I can not write when someone tells me too. I really wonder how people can take what a person writes and interpret it to mean something totally random. I just find that absolutely bizzare. I do not think that I would ever have that ability. I have two meetingts to go to tonight, and I do not know how I am going to do this, because they are both at the same times. Yay I am getting excited because I only have like two and a half minutes left to go. This really shows you how long twenty minutes is. I always thought that it was a really short time, but when you have to do something like this where you watch the time tick by, you are able to see that twenty minutes is a real long time. I really do not like Mondays and Wednesdays. I do not like the fact that I have classes in the morning and then I have a huge break, and then I have classes in the afternoon.

Ooo this key board is really dirty, I should clean it. should what a funny word. I should do lots of things. Sunday morning, man it is hot. my ac was out for the last two days, but it is on now so this world is alot nicer. I am in a better mood. I feel relaxed this morning, peaceful. Sundays seem to do that to me, especially when the Monday is going to be a holiday. The fan is blowing on me and I feel great. I ran this morning 8 miles around town lake and it has to be one of the hottest mornings yet. wow, very sticky. I felt exhausted and sick when I was done, but nothing water couldn't fix. The radio is on in my room the TV in the living room and my roommate�s radio in her room. many a noises going through my head. Oh I need to change my calendar page tomorrow, I just noticed that. august is over, wow that went fast. each year seems to go faster then the last. I can remember being 16 thinking college would never come and now I am a junior and college is almost over! what happened. dishes I need to do the dishes before I leave today. I am going out to my ranch to meet up with my family for the day. Why is there chocolate in my bed? That is odd. The arch of my foot hurts. no good. can't have that for running. tomorrow there is a 4 mile race around town lake. 7:30 am. maybe I�ll run in that, maybe I�ll actually sleep in one day. I haven't yet. not really since last spring semester. It was the busiest summer that I have had in a long time. poof. Oh I need to write Andy a letter. I keep forgetting. It was nice to talk with him yesterday. especially since he paid the bill. That always helps. I have quite the movie collection going now I just noticed all my cassettes. I don't like this song playing now. hey the TV went off. I don't want to drive today. I am tired of driving. My relaxed attitude seems to be disappearing. I am beginning to think of all the readings I have to begin doing. I took 15 hours this summer so I am tired. what happened to that thing called break? I think it forgot me, but I had a great summer. can't complain, plus now I am that much more along. I am glad I did what I did.

‎so there you go. my one feeling. tired. I think ill get to know that a little more as the semester goes on. and now I'm beginning to feel another emotion. that of annoyance. my roommate is talking to me about a bunch of crap while I'm trying to do this thing. I've got a dull sort of sensation in my head. I guess I've been working to hard. or maybe that could be from that lack of sleep. but then why do I want to dwell on this the whole time. can I not think of anything better to say?. that brings me to my biggest character flaw. not knowing what to say. and why the hell do I want to bring this up. I don't know. my mind wanders again as he talks somemore. I'm also beginning to feel a little overwhelmed with the college work load. I don't really think it is that much stuff. it's just that I have one class I don't like at all. that being good old rhet/comp. and how can I hate a class like that so much. I hate writing and reading. simply put. I have a strong sensation to end right here with this writing. but then that just wouldn't be right. and then I think I might be able to get something out of this. I kind of feel like I'm doing this incorrectly. seems more like a diary to me. and now the people outside the dorm room are making noise. do they ever have any freaking homework to do. at least I havent heard the bass being played way to damn loud today. the sob was playing the stuff at 2 in the moring. not that it woke me up. but I got to hear my roommate bitch about it. I kind of feel proud of myself somewhat today. I had somewhat of a social interaction with a girl. something that hasnt happened in a while. if ever. yeah. sad state of affairs for me. that brings me back to think of why I havent gone anywhere in my life with the opposite sex. I guess if I just got to being a little more social. yeah. I could fix that problem. well. at least that was a start today. now if I could just keep stuff like that up and not be so much of an introvert. I might just turn out ok. now I'm low in the well of ideas. what else to type about. am I even doing what the assignment was asking of. I remember going to the therapist while I was in middle school. she said I had to express myself. and not be afraid to feel my emotions. yada yada. I know I have emotions to feel. I guess I'm just too damn shy to show them sometime. and now I hear female voices outside. I'm kind of glad I hear them. takes my mind away from doing this. and lets me concentrate on them.

I shouldn't have done that. but I'm an adult. ,I should do whatever I feel and they should just except it. turn that music off. my roommate listens to some weird stuff. what is that? it's depressing. I don't like it. it makes me homesick. why? it doesn't even remind me of home. gee, I want to listen to some rap but I'm sitting here writing continuously. is that how you spell it. it's hard to type what you think when you think it. even though they said not worry about grammar and all, I'm still worried. what if the professor thinks I'm stupid because I can't type. what if I am stupid because I can't type. thank got for backspace. anyhow, what is this for. why am I typing this. I need to do it. it's homework. I need to do homework. I feel bad. confused. wrong. should I take notes while I read in my textbooks. I don't know. I feel like an outcast when I don't take notes in my classes. should I? should I be writing down everything the professor says. should I? I'll find out when we take our first test. then when I fail, I can say now I know what to do when the problem could have been solved in the beginning by the teacher saying, please take notes because everything on the test will be from lecture. you bought the book because the university needs another way to spend money they know you don't have. ha! that was funny. okay, where was I. thinking still. I'm hungry. I can't stand the food at jester but I eat it like I've never had food before. it's just there and it tells me eat me fat boy you paid for it so eat it. I try to tell myself to find something descent like the gourmet pizza, not, or the soybean burgers but I keep getting in line to have that crappy stuff ion the choices line. never anything worth getting but I still eat it. Why? I miss home cooking, not that my mother ever cooks but McDonalds serves as a home cooked meal for me since that is what we had for dinner a lot when I was growing up. McDonalds is good. I like the nuggets? barbecue sauce is the bomb. one time I went to McDonalds and they wouldn't give me any barbecue sauce. bastards. anyway, what was I talking about. so, I miss my home. I miss my friends. I called each of them the first week I was here. they all stayed at home to go to college there, or joined the military, or just didn't go to college.

‎Wow, I'm pretty tired right now it's been a heck of a weekend. staying up for Diana's funeral was pointless, but nevertheless interesting. I wonder if I'll have that kind of burial when I die. I think my grandfather  should at least had a funeral twice that size. he was the second greatest man to ever walk on this earth besides Jesus Christ himself. I'm listening to the live dcTalk album right now and it rocks. There is no group of celebrities that I admire more than them. Their music has meaning. It isn't just the meaningless stuff about drugs, shooting somebody up, or scoring with someone. It is stuff that is relevant to our world and to our generation, not to mention it is the best musically sounding stuff out there. I wish more people knew about them. I know they would agree with me. the game this weekend surpassed my expectations. At first I thought it was going to be lame 'cause the crowd was soo dead, but as soon as we scored the crowd went wild and the atmosphere from then on was electric. UCLA will be a very tuff game next weekend. My parents are coming up for the game. Surprisingly I don't miss them all that much, although  I do care about them a bunch. Maybe it's just because I'm soo busy with school I really hope that my edp paper is not that hard because I lack the motivation. I really wish my acne would go away. I believe life would be soo much better if it were gone. The confidence and social skills would be so easy and fun. I wouldn't be soo much of a hermit. I hope I can get my hair to grow out to the right length and get it colored they way I want to. I also hope that I can acquire the presence I am seeking as far as my appearance goes. It would really be awesome if we won a national championship this year and Ricky Williams won a Heisman Trophy or even James Brown( by the way I hope he is okay). Richard Walton did a great job backing up and filling in. Gee I hope I make it to class on time and I really hope my future girlfriend is there to ask me out. ‎stream of consciousness‎0

I usually don't get assignments done thiis quick but I have a lot of stuff to talk about soi thought I'd go ahead and do it. I found out about bonnie having breast cancer today and that just adds to the fact that meme has cancer as well. that's two people in one week that I'm close to that have found out that they have cancer. I haven't known many people in my life wit hcancer and all of the sudden this happens. I really wish they didn't have to go through kemo therapy. it seems so primitive and I hope a more efficient and effective cure is found soon. I talked to rachel tonight. I know we will probably never have anything but the situation with her mom may bring us all very close. I love them like my own family and I know that me and mom are ready to fly out there anytime we're needed. five minutes have gone by and I'm already tired of typing. I'm excited about seeing ashley this weekend. I miss her. I'm really looking forward to meeting all of seth's friends. he says they're all hot so this ought  to be a good weekend. I'm glad everything has worked out with seth and my parents. I feel a lot more happy when I talk to rachel. she still has that effect on me even after the rough time we had this summer. I still think she is one of the finest girls I have ever met. I just got a new email but I can't check it for another ten minutes and that is going to drive me crazy. I have to clean my truck out tomorrow. after starr dumped that frapuccino all over the place, it has stunk in there. this is a really good song. I like listening to heartbeats on the beat. somethimes they depress me though. I wish I could send one out to someone special. I'm sure she's out there; I just have to be patient and not try to force anything to happen. I have a really good life. it would be much better with a girl but I can do without untill the right one comes along.

‎I can't believe I am doing this, and that I actually am getting through it, because this is the first time that I have ever logged on to the world wide web, at least I think that is what you call it. To tell you the truth it is actually easier than I thought it would be, I expected it to be very difficult, but it's not all that bad. Anyhow all this computer stuff is fairly new to me and so it is rather confusing for me at times. But I guess I am coping with it and handling it the best I can. Though I am always afraid that I will hit one button and the whole place will shut down. Actually, that is a true nightmare that I have had before. Which reminds me that I have been having really strange dreams lately, and all of them concern a different aspect of school. Which I guess is because I have just moved here from a really small town. And when I say small, I mean really , really small, like about fifteen hundred people in the whole town. Now compared to that Austin is a real shocker. I guess it just takes some getting used to , and learning new things when you move from a farm to a fast paced city. So many things are different and yet so many things are the same. A funny thing happened when I first moved here a week ago, I found out that my cousin, she is the same age as me, is living in the apartment directly above mine. to me this is such a coincidence, really when you think about it is. Just think of how many apartment buildings there are in Austin, and I unknowingly chose the exact same one that she did. And she and I only used to see each other once a year, but now we see each other nearly every day. Christmas, when our families all got together was the only time we saw each other,  I am already looking forward to the Christmas season because of the weather that we have at that time. I am so tired of this ninety degree weather. I can't wait for a cold spell or a norther to blow in and cool everything off. But I guess that won't happen for a while yet anyway. That reminds me that I have to pick up a raincoat or an umbrella before this weekend, because I am planning to go to my youngest brothers football game, and I want to be prepared in case it happened to rain. More than likely it won't rain, but I know that If I don't get a raincoat or umbrella then sure enough it will pour. I don't usually enjoy watching football games, actually I don't ever enjoy watching it, but my brother begged me and begged me to come see him, so I finally told him that we would come watch him this Friday. he's supposed to be really good.‎stream of consciousness‎0

‎My mind is totally blank right now. I am just happy that got in the computer lab and was able to use a computer without a long wait. I am kind of lost as to what  to write. I am thinking about how much time I have to pass before my next class  starts and I am wondering what to do to make the time go faster. I saw one of my  friends from high school today. I am happy that I finally saw a familiar face. Why is that light blinking on the CD-ROM door? I did not put a CD in the drive. I hope I doing this assignment right. I want a new day planner. I am tired of  looking at that Nike symbol on mine. I want a leather one but my parents don't think I should $50 for a day planner, so oh well there goes that. I need to paint my fingernails. They are so plain looking. I think I might paint them tonight, oh no  I can't. I have precal homework to do. I need go and have them painted and maybe  I can treat my mom also. She needs to pamper herself. This chair is quite comfortable. I like how the back gives in when you lean back. I need this for my computer at home. There are a lot of Dell computer boxes in the corner of this room. I wonder how many are there. I wonder if the MTV music awards are going to be good tonight. I missed the awards last year. I don't even who won. I hope its not raining right now or when I am ready to  leave. My hair will frizz so bad and I'll have to blow-dry it out to make it smooth again. I wish I could where my hair naturally curly but its just too frizzy. My niece has the best hair and her mother doesn't take care of it. What are doors to side of this room for?   Where do they lead?  My hands are cold. My feet are cold, too. I wonder if this shirt makes me look fat. The stripes are going horizontal. I need to start back to exercising like I used to. That boy is kinda cute who just walked by. My finger are really cold. The air conditioning must be up pretty high in here. I am always colder than most people. Maybe I have small blood vessels in my hands and feet or something. I just can't get over how Princess Diana died. She seemed to  be such nice person. What is this black cord wrapped around the bottom of the monitor?  What is it used for?  I am sleepy and I have another class to go to today. I hope I perk up. I 'e never seen a window button on a computer before but then I've never used a Dell computer before either. How wide are the margins on this sheet.‎stream of consciousness‎0

‎The clock is ticking and I have to wake up at 8 o clock tomorrow. Lots of white space on the wall and on the screen, purple hat on the side, people walking in the stairs red trees falling off the building. It is difficult to speak continuously, perhaps there should be pauses in between words but then there would be no coherency but then there is no fluctuation in tone and all the mechanics of rules and boundaries rendering the sentences more honest than not. Difficult to type without thinking, every once in a while something pops into my head but prolonged thought disrupts the image and I forget what to say, and the thought of forgetting makes me think more about it, disrupting it further and pushing any sense of coherency into the deepest of abysses. Hunger stirs in my stomach, quiet thoughts in my head about simple things, nostalgia, reminiscing all things past, good and bad, because there can be no good without the bad, the contrast makes all the difference. Peter Parker was an extraoridinary young man as a result of his radioactive bite, I fail to have any of his special abilities, lacking in the radioactive bites. Does this make me less extraoridinary?  Or perhaps I am something of a special person, considering all the different things that happen. Comic book heroes have nothing to do but save and do superpowers and shoot bad guys but in the realm of the real world i am an exemplary everyman with no superpowers making me different than Peter Parker. My computer is overloaded or maybe my mind is going crazy, but this has been an inordinate amount of time.   7 minutes into the assignment, it is difficult to type without stopping the train of thought im currently in. All I can think about at the moment is how different this assignment is compared to anything i have ever done for any class. Flowing and ebbing out of my mind like a loose river flooding the dam, breaking the barrier and drowning out rationality. Confusion and mayhem and all things in my head in disarray, unquestionably noisy because of my roommate, undeniably hot because of centralized air conditioning. Tired of typing, concerned about the method of writing , and if my stream of consciousncess is anything like the professor expects. Should words be spelled correctly?  MAybe I should stop correcting typos and keep typing the letters on the keyboard. People are talking to me but i have managed to tune them out, a song is playing somewhere in the distance, or maybe it is right next to me. at this point it makes no difference. i am confused still, a bit baffled, left in stupor. finding the words to describe anything is tough. i visited home over the weekend and realized i didn't miss it too much. i appreciate my family and love them but the thought of a monthly visit home makes me cringe slightly. the blue cable running from my laptop to the‎stream of consciousness‎0

‎well, today is a pretty easy relaxaing day. I've kinda gotten into the school mood now so it's not too hard to sit down and get stuff done like it was a couple days ago. when I got here I had no clue it was going to be just what I thought is was going to be like. needless to say, I'm happy. it feels just like a movie or something. I'm so lucky to have such a great roommate. she's so awesome. we knew eachother in high school but we never were great friends so it works out perfect. we always can feel free to go our separate ways and always have someone to come home to and share our nights with. we are so much alike and so much different that God sure put us in the right place. we make eachother laugh. she even hooked me up the other night with one of her friends and I had a great time. we were discussing something last night though. we haven't seemed to find our nitch yet. we've met a lot of people, together and separatly, but I guess it just takes awhile to find your friends huh?  I'm not too worried or depressed about it yet. I'm busy as it is. friends will come. I wish matt from orientation calls me. I think we could be really good friends. I'm pretty upset with some of my friends right now. mainly blake. my old best guy friend. we used to be so tight but now he's changed. all he cares about is partying and drinking and keeping an image. it's so not him and he knows it. he is so much better than that and we've even talked about it before. I just care for him and miss him but both of us are too stubborn to call first and stuff like that. we've always been that way. let me tell you, senior year with him was pretty stressful. I just wish sometimes things were what they used to be. don't get me wrong. I absolutely love college but I guess I miss all of the tight friendships I had and my little group at school. but I love everything about college (except for the showers) :)  well, that's it for now. besides the fact that I wish I had some significant other. or maybe I don't. sometimes I wish I did but I still enjoy looking at other guys and flirting and I'm still meeting people now so I guess it's good I'm not tied down. and I'm really excited I found a theater club I could join here. and I don't have to major in theater. I did a lot of that in high school (hated my teacher) but I was a role model to a lot of people and that made it easier to cope with her. I'm so glad that we have email today. it makes it such an easier way to talk and communicate with people. I miss my friends and family‎stream of consciousness‎0

‎Right now, I'm a little confused. I'm not sure how one goes about tracking their feelings, or even focuses on them long enough while typing. I'm wondering if anyone is really going to read this. While I'm a little frustrated with the assignment, I think I would much prefer to be the one typing than whoever the poor soul is that has to read 900 some odd of these things for whatever purpose. OK. My arm itches. Now I feel stupid for typing that. I'm a little tired. It's almost 9 at night and I've been at school all day. 17 and a half minutes. I'm sitting in the UGL. I like their computers because they are much faster than mine at home. I only have dial up. Also, I like the library computer lab because I like to listen to all the clicking of the keys on the keyboards by the other people in the room. Now I'm a little self conscious that I may be hitting the keys too loud. I'm typing much quieter now. 14 and a half more minutes. I'm in a chair that rotates and rocks. I like chairs like that because I can move around. I can't sit still too long. I'm a fast mover. Even in class I'm constantly rocking, or fidgeting, or drumming with my fingers. I'm getting tense. I'm anxious for the 20 minutes to be up. 12 and a half minutes. I'm running out of things to say. This is very much like a one sided conversation. OK. I'm stumped. I'm sitting here racking my brain, but in doing so I think I'm violating the purpose of this assignment as being random. 10 more minutes to go. My arm itches again. Ha ha. I have my cell phone next to the keyboard. My girlfriend got it for me, but I hate it. It gets horrible range, and the ring is weak. It rings like an old feminine man. I'm ashamed to carry it around. My girlfriend insists, though, so I do. It's the path of least resistance. I'm better at arguing than she is, but she can argue longer, and in the end, it's her endurance that wins out. I'm swinging in my chair. I seriously hope no one has to read this. I hope this is some study about how long 18-24 year old males typically type in 20 minutes or something. My sincere condolences to whomever has the misfortune of pouring over each one of these with the intent to interpret some psychological insights. 3 more minutes. I'm perking up a little bit. I can see the proverbial finish line. I'm swinging in my chair again, but my arm stopped itching. Yeah!  2 minutes. OK. Now, I'll admit. I'm stalling. I'm holding out for 2 minutes. This is like watching water boil. What I'm feeling?  I've never been so anxious all day as I am right now. 1 minute. I'm stumped. 10 seconds. Bye! ‎stream of consciousness‎0

‎     I really don't know what to write about. It is funny when you try to think about what you are thinking about and you can't seem to find anything in your head. My friend is talking to his girlfriend. Typing is a lot harder than I remember. September 11th is coming up and I hear patriotic music in the background. My drive back to Austin today was very hard. It rained the whole way down here so instead of the usual three hour drive it turned into nearly four hours. My band practiced very well this weekend. We put in about four hours of practice. Our show this weekend was cancelled so instead we decided to practice. We did a little recording in my guitar player's garage. I stayed up very late yesterday just talking to some friends online. I had a huge burrito from Chipolte. I had never been there before so it was a surprise to see a burrito that big; however, I didn't really enjoy it because they put onions and peppers in it. I suppose it was my fault, because I told them what to put in it. I said I wanted fajita chicken and then started putting peppers and onions in the burrito. I thought the fajita part was the way the cooked the chicken. It turns out it was just the stuff they put in with the chicken. I didn't eat much of it, but I will still give the place a second chance. Now I know not to order that kind of burrito. My parents took my girlfriend and her friend out to dinner on friday night. We went to chili's off of F. M. 3040. After that we went to my girlfriend's house and just played the piano. We played for about two hours. I figured out how to play two new songs. One was a spanish song and the other was carol of the bells. We had no music, we were just going by ear. My girlfriend's friend was getting very annoyed because she did not want to play the piano. Instead she played cards with my girlfriend's family. Studying for college has not been going the way I would like it. I told myself I would stay caught up with all of my classes, but I seem to have fallen behind already with all of them. I just need to concentrate and read like a mad man. Dave Matthews keeps running through my ears and I can't get the lyrics from entering.   How can I turn away. Brother sister go dancing.   I went to two of his concerts this year. They were a blast. There were so many fans yelling and screaming. The atmosphere was so pleasant. He played a few of my favorite songs and I nearly cried. The University of Oklahoma football game was very interesting. They almost lost. I was so excited with two minutes left in the game and Oklahoma trailing Alabama by three points. Unfortunately OU won.‎stream of consciousness‎0

I bet reading them is pretty darn interesting. Haha i held back with the   darn   right there. haha. Anyways, I don't want to do calculus. The fiddle sounds really cool in this song. Here's the solo. IT soudns awesome. Seriously, download the song and listen to the solo. You'll like it. . . if you're a Texan. . haha. I hate Antonian high school. My buddy sent me a link to a webpage of theirs, and they were all proud of having made it to the state semis in baseball. Funny thing is, they lost in the first round of playoffs. We had the same records last year (need to change song again) but they went to playoffs because they had a better head to head record. We lost to them both times in the bottom of the last inning. You have no idea how upset we were. A freaking junior dropped a fly ball in the outfield to give them the tying run. I'm still pissed about that, but oh well. This song is awesome. Southbound 35 by Pat Green. It talks about coming back to Texas when he's leaving in Kansas. It's pretty cool. So what else. . I don't know how I'm getting to the OU game. I got to find a ride, maybe with Amy. Homework is no fun. Haha. I love it when they mention Austin in songs. It's pretty cool. I have to clean my room. I need to call whats that place. Midnight Rodeo and ask about the cover and when Cory goes on stage. Hope it's not much. College is quite expensive man. I love this part. Ya. . we were. soutbound 35!. . haha. New song coming. . I feel like a little Palo Alto, Naked Sorority Girls. The lyrics in that one are pretty funny. A Sigma Chi guy showed me this song during Rush Week. They're too expenisve. I think Delta Sig is the way to go. They're cool. This song has an awesome beat. Haha almost done. This actually went by pretty fast. What to do after? Maybe find someone who knows how to do those calculus problems. But when it comes to love, its all Greek to me! haha. . . I love this song. Well this has been fun.

‎I want money. I like money. What is the easiest way to get it?  Winning the lottery is too hard. Maybe I can get a wish to come true. A wish. Where do wishes come from?  I hear you get a wish if you catch a leprechaun, but what is a leprechaun, little guys, red hair, beards?  Where would one find a leprechaun?  If I found one, how could I catch it?  It must be fast, or everyone would catch them and get wishes. They must live in scotland, or ireland because of the red hair and accent- I wonder if they drink. A drunk leprechaun. Funny,  The life of the party. Granting wishes for everyone. What wish do I want?  What else?  Money, happiness  power?  Power is good. Maybe I could have enough power to order someone elses death, or prevent it. I could rule the world, like everyone wants to deep down inside. or maybe I don't. I just want to sit back in the country somewhereand be by myself, maybe witha family. Two kids. Maybe some livestock to get money with. invest it  live off interest. That sounds good. I could stopgoing to school, go home, and sleep for a while. sleep. sleep is good. I like sleeping. But the time goes faster when I sleep. Do I want to go faster?  no?   yes?  maybe?  definitely maybe. I don't want to miss anything, but I want to skip ahead to a more relaxing part of my life. I'm too lazy to have to work for a living. I don't know how I'm going to get through it. All of this studying. hasnt gotten me anywhere yet. But I only just started. preparing for my future. The future is a fantastic place. It can be whatever we make it, but that will be a bad place, if I know what I'm talking about. People die. kill eachother. Why? to what end?  Everyone dies. What difference does it make when?  I would prefer to die later in my life, though. I guess I want to wait and see what comes of me, in the end. In the next millenium. Nostradamus says the world will end. soon. I want to see if it happens. That would be something to tell the grandkids about. the end of the world. Not everything would die. that can't happen. life goes on. Not as it is known, but in some form. A science teacher of mine once said that fire ants would inherit the earth. As long as its well after I'm dead, I don't care who has it. The world will fend for itself, unless we destroy it before we destroy eachother. Its a race to see who wins, but no one will. a race to the edge of a cliff. Media tells us its not coming,  they make a road for us to race on, and fun buildings along the sides, they tell us‎stream of consciousness‎0

‎Wow, Its the end of another week ,and finally I get time to relax . My idea of relaxing isn't partying or drinking. My idea of relaxing is sleeping. Yes sleeping for long hours with nothing on my mind, is my favorite hobby. My roommate is reading what I'm reading so I had to halt before I continued typing. There's another friend in my room and he's laughing at what I just wrote. He shouldn't be reading other people's thoughts! Wow 3 minutes over already. I got 17 minutes left . I'm just feeling really light right now. Light in the head. I can't think of anything to write. This is supposed to be a spontaneous writing assignment. It's definitely better than the other assignments where you have to prepare drafts and correct mistakes over and over again. Tomorrow's Saturday and Saturday means another football game for UT. I couldn't go for the first game, because I didn't have the football package and the tickets cost a lot out of the package. My roommate is making me listen to one of her songs right now. So basically I'm doing two things at a time-typing and listening to music. Some people can study with music playing, I still haven't tried studying with music playing in the background. Maybe I should try it out sometime. I think it is important to knock before you enter a room. But that just doesn't happen in Jester. One of my friends just barged in, and I jumped in my seat. This is crazy. I should tell him not to do that again. I'm not that fastidious actually. But certain things annoy me. The things that would annoy me would actually annoy any normal human being, so I know I'm not a freak. I have to call my mom tonight and tell her about the week's events. It's been a great week. My chemistry test went well. I really want to maintain high grades throughout the semester, so I can get some kind of scholarship. I don't want my father to pay so much for my education. He doesn't grumble or anything, but I just feel guilty. I know that I have to work extra hard because I have been given a wonderful opportunity to study in a great school like Stand I must make good use of this advantage I have over other people. I'm loving it here. I came to America exactly a month ago. Wow I should be celebrating today. It's been a month in the United States. This stupid friend is irritating me, Wish I could ask him to leave, I can't concentrate on my thoughts. He's asking me why I type with just two fingers. God. I'm going to tell him to mind his own business. I better change the topic . Or he might read this ,and get annoyed and abuse me or something. Yeah but making friends has been tough. I haven't made too many friends. My roommate is my best friend  as of now. I couldn't have asked‎stream of consciousness‎0

‎Right now it id 9:30 in the morning and I wish that I was still asleep. I had a Biology discussion this morning and it was really boring. I don't really understand what goes on in that class. Science isn't my best subject, but I guess I am going to have to improve that because my major is mainly based on that. And if I don't do well in those classes, I can't get accepted into upper divison. I'm not sure. I have been thinking about changing out of nursing because I really want to dance but I just don't think that there is a living in that profession. But at least I would really enjoy it. I wish I were more like my bestfriend in that aspect. He does what he wants because he wants to do it. He isn't worried about his future and I know that's kind of bad, but he really loves what he does. And he is good at it. I just don't seem to be good at much of anything and school just worries me. I wish I could push myself more, but I just don't have the motivation. I try at least. My classes are really hard and I am worried about doing well in them. This is my first time to be away from home and I want to prove to everyone that I am not as incapable as everyone thinks that I am. My own boyfriend doesn't really have faith in me. He thinks that I can't hold my own and that I have to depend on everyone else to help me through what I do. And maybe in some aspects that is true. I have had a difficult time just being myslef. I feel like people don't want to talk to me, or that what I say isn't as important as the next person. Enough about my problems though, right? Today I am going to get a tattoo. I have always wanted one and I have never had the nerve to go and get one. I think it is going to hurt really bad but I think that I am finally ready for one. I have been looking at what kind I want and printed some out off the computer. I hope that they can do the one that I want. I guess I am just going to have to wait and see what happens with that. Today I have 3 classes left to go to. This being one of them. I have a hard time paying attention in this Psychology class. I just can't seem to get interested in it for a complete hour and a half. All of my other classes are just 50 minutes and it seems easier to pay attention in them. But I added this class so 3:30 was the only time that was left open. I had to take it. Thinking about school, I am going to go home and take summer school at SFA. I feel that if I can get some credtis there‎stream of consciousness‎0

‎Right now I am watching tv. I it kinda hard to type with these nails, I don't think I have had to type a large amount since I got them. The commercials on tv are so stupid, especially the ones for women's health. I need to get my nails filled, but I don't think I am going to spend the money on it, there are more important things that I can spend my money on. I would be nice if I had a newer computer, this one gets the job done though. I just don't know how reliable, because my sister had all kinds of stuff on it when it was hers, and as a result it on its third hard drive. Last year at the beginning of the year, my computer crashed. that wasn't too much fun, because I had all those assignments to turn in and no computer. I is amazing how you can take technology like that for granted, and how limited you feel once it isn't there anymore. Everything seems so materialistic, but I must admit that I am just as materialistic as anybody else. Where my keyboard is isn't very comfortable for typing. Got that book for my sister. That is so weird how her teacher died so suddenly right before school starts. mom said that he had a nine year old and a five year old. That must be so hard. It seems weird that now his wife will be the one teaching the class. I guess she has some kind of degree related to psychology as well. Maybe that is how she and her late husband met. Mom's birthday is on Friday. I need to get a card for her, and I need to get a card for Luis. I can't forget that when I go to the store tonight. Hopefully that won't take up too much time, because I have a lot of reading I need to do and write notes over what I read. It is frustrating, because I am always reading and doing homework, yet I constantly seem behind. I guess I have just never taken this many reading classes at once before. That sucks though, because then I will have to take several sciences at once too, and that will be just as hard. It is hard to get that balance, esp. when you are a transfer student and are trying to figure out how everything transfers. I wish I could have gotten an appointment with that advisor at the health science center sooner. you would think that they would have more than one advisor, especially since she will or has been out for at least a month. I hope that someone from Health south will call me back, if not I will call again since I just got an answering machine and had to leave a message. I would really like to start working again, especially because I need more hours.

‎I feel some anger at the world, and at God too. (Yes, Prof. Pennebaker, I believe there is a God!) But real religion requires immense amounts of faith, and I have to trust that everything will end up ok. Now I feel slightly reassured. If only everything weren't so uncertain! But do I really want a world where you know exactly what's going to happen next? What if you knew when bad things were going to happen, but were powerless to prevent any of them, because everything was predestined? It's possible that everything IS predestined, but that we don't know about it. Maybe you don't admit that as a possibility, Prof. P, but I do. Anyhow, I would much rather not know what's going to happen next in most cases. But in some, like who I'm going to marry, I can barely contain my curiosity. I guess that's due to a lack of satisfying relationships in my life, that I so strongly feel the need for another one. But whatever happens, I refuse to worry  if everything's predestined, I can't change it anyway, and if it is, then I can still change things for the better. ‎stream of consciousness‎0

‎"""In fact I always think about her whenever I have a spare moment. She is in my every thought. She is so far away from me, yet in my heart she is so close. I read some poetry tonight, Love Sonnets, and all I could think about was her. She is so beautiful. I long for the next time I can see her. It seems like only yesterday we met for the first time. I talk about her constantly to all my friends to the point, where they are either sick of hearing about her, or know her almost as well as I do. I know it's not the best thing to go through, but I am seem to be sad all the time. Not literally, or maybe literally, but it is hard to explain. I love her more then life itself, but I """"hate"""" her for leaving me. Not really hate, but I don't know how to explain it, but more like I guess a little dislike. Nothing I can't handle, I just wish she was here with me. It doesn't seem fair. I see all of my friend's with their significant others, and they are next to each other always. Sharing all the """"special"""" moments in their lives, but I have to wait at least a week, before I can call her. The bill is too expensive otherwise. I beg her to come back, knowing full and well, that she can't do that, but it seems to help but sometimes hurt at the same time. She is so special to me, and I can wait forever for her. Most people think that is absurd, but she is my everything. Being sad a lot I know is to a degree not healthy, but what can I do. The moment she walked down the corridor in the airport, I heart stopped smiling. Since that gloomy day in June, a part of me has been gone. Although I smile on the outside, on the inside I am sad. The day her sweet embrace takes me in, only then can I smile. That day is not too far away, and I long for it. I guess this is the best part of being sad, because I feel better thinking about the future, the only thing is that it is a type of perpetual loop. As soon as I think about the future and being with her, I get sad again thinking that I have to wait another few months. Then I think about all the times that I will be """"alone"""" without her. As much as my friends are great, I have none really. She is my one and only TRUE friend. I have some friends, I. e. my roommate, and a several other people that genuinely care, but most of them don't. I have pretty much stopped """"trying"""" to be there as much as I have in the past. I feel that I am only a friend in the convenience of someone else. I feel that they only come to talk to‎stream of consciousness‎0
‎     Today has been such a long day. I am not a big fan of tuesdays. Physics makes me feel so stupid. I feel like everybody else knows exactly what he is talking about in that class except for me. This is kind of weird writing to a computer about my thoughts, kind of like an online journal. I really need to start writing in my actual journal every night. I did last year, but ever since I got here, I just haven't made the time everynight. Kristen and I have been getting along great. I think we are going to be great roomates. I've been thinking a lot about me and Patrick a lot lately. I'm not sure if I can handle another 2 years of him living in Dallas and me in Austin. I know we've done it since March, but I think it is getting harder. I wish I knew how to type. I think my entry is going to be 1/3 the length of Kristen's, but I guess it doesn't really matter. Man I've got so much to do tonight. I need to read for psychology, interior, art history, and figure out my physics homework before Thursday. My mom and I have been getting along really well lately. I think we are going to be much better friends now that we don't live under the same roof. I'm not sure when I'm going to be able to go see my grandparents. Gosh, I haven't seen them in forever. Maybe i should go somewhere to study tonight instead of trying to study in my room. I never feel like I accomplish very much in here. What really stinks is I can't read my art history anywhere else but in the room. those stupid reserves just won't print out right. I guess I could try that adobe business that girl was talking about during class. I'm not sure if I'll have to buy that or iff my dad could just put it on my computer off what we have at home. I can't wait to watch Friends later. It's been fun lately because they've been playing a season that I've never seen. It's always the small things that make me the happiest. Oh no, the phone is ringing. i guess the will just have to wait for 3 more minutes. It was probably Kristen at the grocery store. I'll just call her back in a second. i'm glad tommorrow isn't as jam packed as tuesdays. I couldn't take two in a row. Now my cell phone is ringing, what's up?  ‎stream of consciousness‎0

‎20 minutes. that's a long time. I'm not sure if I have enought thoughts to fill 20 minutes. that's a lot of seconds too. 20 x 60 = 12000 seconds, I think. unless I put one too many zero's and then I suppose it wouldn't be too bad. luckily, I have a timer for the kitchen that my grandmother just sent me for my birthday that I can use to keep track of this writing assignment. I'm also listening to some tunes as I write this. I don't know if that is allowed, but I think I would get too bored if I didn't get to listen to music. I love listening to music very much. and I love belle and sebastian very much which is what I happen to be listening too now. unfortunately, I can not sing nor do I have the ability to play any musical instruments. what a sad sad state of affairs. I am also drinking some orange soda as I write this. mmmmm, orange soda. I just baked a pineapple upside down cake and I think that I just might have turned out well. as well as a pineapple upside down cake can be I suppose. later tonight I think I am going to visit my strange friend kurt and his roommate adam. they are having a little gathering there. it's a good thing I don't have school tomorrow. esp. since I have tons of work to do and I haven't done any of it yet. I have gotten far behind these first couple of weeks. some of it is because of the recent move but that's just an excuse for the most part. I'd just rather be doing other things than homework lots of the time. I really need to figure out what I'm going to do with the rest of my life. I don't want to work just yet, so that means more school. I am positive that law school is notthe place for me to be. maybe public policy, but even that I'm not all that sure of. maybe someone will offer me a job where all I do is sit around all day playing jezzball, looking cute. maybe they'll pay me lots of money for that. wouldn't that be nice. I'm sure that I wouldnt' be the only applicatant for a job that sweet. I also need to figure out what on earth I'm going to do for my junior fellows project. dean carver is going to freak out if I don't come up with something soon. I'm such a slacker, I don't' know why they keep letting me do stuff at this university. I worry for jessica and her three hours of school this semester. I don't think that's such a good idea. how easy will it be for her to justify dropping that one class? far too. I don't know what she thinks she's going to do with the rest of her life. run off with michael wherever he decides to go in may? that will hardly work for‎stream of consciousness‎0

‎I'm pretty stressed out right now, I just have to get this paper out of the way so I can start on my other 615 hours of homework. What is going through my mind right now, hmmm I haven't called home enough. I've skipped Biology too many times, but I still need an A. I think the teacher is throwing way too much at us for this to only be a 2 hour class. I can get through it though. What is going on in my mind right now?? Actually, I'm thinking I need to think of something interesting to write about so the person who has to read all these doesn't slip into a coma and die. I have a date tomorrow night with a girl that I hardly know, but she was cute enough I don't know what I think about this date thing every weekend, it is getting very old way too fast. How is that supposed to help me adapt to college life. A date is not necessary for every single event, especially when I am dressed up as Country Club Ken (by choice of course). I just heard from someone that this socalled hot date I have has some personal issues. What is that supposed to mean? No one would go into detail, just that she had issues. She could be a bulimic head case for all I know or it could be something simple like she is very into herself. I have a friend who always says that about someone else, but they couldn't describe it. I'm worried about my roommate. He acts strait but every once in a while I catch him staring at me when I get out of the shower. Now that I think about it, it is extremely hard to write about my constant thoughts, because you have to put effort into typing it out, you cannot just think. In class, that is when I can think continuously without interruption, the things that go through my mind in one hour of lecture can begin with some girl I saw looking at me and end up with my thoughts about my first exam next week. There is one good looking girl on my floor that I keep going back to, I winder if she has issues as well. I have been to her room a couple of times, but I can't decide if it could happen or not, I do not like to go for things unless I am absolutely positive she will say yes. Maybe I think about girls too much, but I am a college freshman boy and what else do we think about besides school occasionally and my lack of money by the second week of the month. How in the world does that always happen to me once I get on my own, I could always manage money at home, but the day I moved up here it just disappeared and now I am already left with hardly nothing. People always told me that, but I never listened. ‎stream of consciousness‎0

My roommate is bustling around the room, packing for retreat, and he forgot to do this assignment, he's running around the room packing and trying to do this assignment, haha, it's kind of funny. sucks for him that he forgot about this, he's going on a campus crusade trip this weekend, so I have the entire room to myself, wonder what things I can do with that luxury, hmmmm, time to ponder what interesting things can happen this weekend. Cosby show is on, I'm waiting to watch my favorite cartoon at 4 o'clock, dragon ball z. Japanese animation at it's best. I think I just have a thing for fighting and energy balls flying through the air and planets being blown up. I guess I'm just like a stereotypical guy. I'M football starts this weekend. I'm pretty excited. I signed up through CBS. known as chinese bible study. should be fun since I get to meet some new people considering I came from a pretty strong contingent of people I already knew from the Dallas area, mainly centered around plano. Austin is a really cool place. more things to do then in plano. but. not having a car kind of sucks. can't just go wherever. unless I feel like walking. which doesn't happen very often. only thing that is troubling is the weather. so freaking hot and humid and. just. nasty. can't wait until fall and winter when it's nice and cool outside with some rain and some mist. that'd be nice. none of this 110 degree weather. for a few months at least. Just got done with classes today. chemistry. right now it's pretty much a review of chemistry I I took in high school. so. not too troublesome yet. but the teacher is pretty good. she's really into the chemistry and lectures well even though most of the people already know how to do everything from high school. but it's nice to see the drive she has to teach and get the information through to us. my roommate just stocked up on food. he made a pilgrimage to the HEB because he's lucky and didn't have a class today. no class at all. what a punk. well. I shouldn't complain. I have one class on Tuesday and Thursday. that's pretty nice. it's just calculus discussion too. so. I can get away with like. dozing off in that class. I'm going to lake travis this weekend with some friends. that should be pretty fun. get away from the city for a bit. and. get nice a dark. hope I don't get burned. and. don't want to turn the color of burnt toast either.

I wouldn't mind not going to the OU game. It would be SO nice to have this place to myself without anyone else ere for a weekend. even if there ws nothing to do. I could catch up on  reading and homework or get ahead. But then again Lne said that most people would die to go to the OU game and that I should accept the offers I receive. I rejected the first. The second one is someone who I just met last night. and I want to attend the game and this is the best way because tickets are so hard to get. But I have to stay in a hotel room with this guy. I guess I will just say I have a boyfriend. Speaking of. I like Chad. He is very nice looking, very polite. He did everything right. I wonder if he likes me? I wonder if he will call today. only time will tell. I hate Michael for what he did to me. No I hate what he did, I don't hate him. I don't hate anybody. Jenny and Emily have become two of my best friends. I talk to each of them several times a day. The weird thing is, they have been friends for 7 years. And now, over some guy, Emily hates Jenny. Emily has done the same thing to me that Jenny has done to Emily. I do not really feel sorry for her. It feels weird that although they do not speak to each other, I speak to each of them many times each day and usually the other is not mentioned, and I dare not bring up the other, I do not want to stir things up or be in the middle of it. So I am going to see Jeff this weekend when I visit Emily. I know he will want me to stay the night with him. But so will Emily. I wonder if she would care. I don't want to do anything with him.

‎"""I'm really use to writing for long periods of time straight and not stop. I keep a little diary myself and write my thoughts and feelings down whenever they overwhelm me. I suppose it's some sort of stress release because I always feel better afterwards. Writing in my diary has allowed me to express my feelings and emotions onto paper. This way, it's easy for me to look at it and then maybe figure out how I am to deal with the emotions. Some things I write about are problems with my relationships with other people. One entry I wrote just recently was about a problem with this guy. There was just so much pressure on me from this guy that liked me that I couldn't really stand it anymore. He told me he liked me, and I suppose he expected me to just like him back. Don't get me wrong, he is a good friend of mine. Maybe that's why it was so hard. But anyways, I was able to express my contained feelings into my diary. It really did help a lot. When I first heard of this assignment on writing for 20 minutes straight without stopping I thought to myself """"wow, this will be fun"""". My roommate, on the other hand groaned and said she would never be able to do something like that. She says there's just not that much to write about. I told her how she could just write bout her day or whatever. 20 minutes goes by pretty quickly if you think about it. It's already been about 5 minutes since I started. I'm typing kind of fast. I suppose it's the flow of the words. Since there's no really structure on this assignment, I can write without thinking too much. I had a pretty harsh day today. Didn't set my alarm clock, thus I woke up 10 minutes before my first class started. And my teacher Is a real stickler for this timing thing. She wants us in our seats and ready to go by the time class starts. That is usually what I would do, but today, I really couldn't do much about that. I hate walking into class late. There's only about 500 zillion people that look at you when you walk in. And you know what they're thinking, """"man, SHE's late"""". I don't like that feeling. Well after the lecture (which I understood very well) I had to go back home because I hadn't brushed my teeth or anything yet. The whole way back I was thinking, """"man. it's too early in the year to be starting this"""". But I got over it. Told my friends and laughed at it for a little bit. That's one of the reasons I love having my old friends here at UT. There's always someone there for you. It's like bringing a little bit of home with you. I live with one of my old friends from high school and she's an awesome roommate. Her boyfriend is also one of my good friends. And‎stream of consciousness‎0

‎"""first of all I don't have set prison like rules and regulations. the classes are a lot more laid back and I can do self paced. high school was much more busy work which was crap. I am worried however about how well I do in college. although I did well high school, college is much different. rather than burning the info into you through busy work and assignments, we have to learn on our own. everybody says that they learned more their freshman year than in all of high school. seeing as how I cram all my assignments into the night before it's due, I plan to change dramatically on how my work is done. the influence of my friends also worries me. because of the many groups of friends I don't think I'll have much time to do studying or productive work. I am hoping that by writing all of this down, I am able to recognize my weaknesses and change them before they do any great harm. since this is stream of consciousness I can't help but write about the catcher in the rye, one of my favorite books. since I'm in psychology, I hope that doesn't mean that I'm going to assassinate any powerful people. the book is great written in stream of consciousness and I feel many of holden's feelings. such as the phoniness in society. the phonies in society really piss me off!  back to college, I hope that I can discipline myself and succeed in college. right now I'm listening to red hot chili peppers. I don't know what that tells about me, but I love their older songs. I can make disappear have no fear! music is my airplane, is my airplane. rrahhh!  four more minutes. I don't know what to write. I have so many thoughts but they're not organized. sex of course is on my mind, and since it's the first day of class, that's on my mind. the crazies passing out the Christian leaflets is also on my mind. it really pisses me off. not that their spreading the word, because I'm catholic. what pisses me off is that they're so hypocritical. they go out preaching but then turn around and drink it up (under age) and sleep around (pre marital sex!)  that disgusts me. although I do drink a little, I don't go out preaching. many of my friends are atheists and agnostic. I view many of their views such as religion's role in being a social and moral standard. after all, if there was no fear in sinning  then crime would skyrocket and the moral stability  of society would disappear. while that is true, not all will revert to barbaric life. while there are laws, religion adds more to the discipline in obeying the basic commandments. we've had hours and hours of discussion on religion and god. from these discussions I see that many misinterpretations of the catholic faith exist. for example, many believe that (through the narrow-mindedness of the teachers of their‎stream of consciousness‎0

Dr Pennebaker, if you are reading this, I accidentally pressed send and did not get to complete my writing. I apologize and hope this doesn't cause any problems. Anyway, another problem I have with my family is the direct relationship between my mother and I. We have always had different personalities, and they have often clashed. We would sometimes go long periods of time when we were furious with each other, but for some reason, I feel that my current situation is the worst. She has recently undergone a lot of personal changes, mostly physical. She is in the process of discovering who she is, which is a perfectly normal thing to do after having a life as tumultuous as hers. She changed her last name, has dyed her hair several different colors, and is seriously considering a nose ring. Now, on an intellectual level, I totally understand her actions. If I were in her shoes, I would want to discover who I was also, and would feel hurt if my daughter did not approve. HOWEVER, these changes she has made still upset me immensely, and she cannot comprehend or accept why I feel this way. Until recently, I could not even explain it to myself. Through talking with a friend, I think I've begun to grasp why I have a problem with this. And here is my answer: the relationship a person has with their mother is supposed to be one of the most meaningful, important relationships of their lives. A mother, no matter how hard you try to escape her, will always be there for you and provide comfort and support. You KNOW who this person is, and they are usually a steady force in your life. Even before my mother began undergoing these changes, we had drifted apart so that I barely knew who she was. And now, after changing herself, I really don't know her. She does not seem to be a rock for my life. The hardest part for me is that she doesn't seem to care how I feel and that her changes upset me. I am not the most emotionally open person, but the fact that she was changing her name was upsetting me so that I actually confronted her about it. This is so unlike me, so I felt very vulnerable in my action. After I told her I was having a problem, she seemed sincerely concerned, and promised that we would talk about it further before she did anything. However, two days later, before we talked more, she went and changed her name anyway. I never asked her to change her life or actions for my sake. All I wanted was for her to know how I felt and that she was upsetting me. Honestly, I think this is a reasonable request. Her apparent disregard for my feelings hurt me tremendously, and we are on very bad terms at the‎stream of consciousness‎0

Such is life!! Oh well. I hope that I do well in this class beacuse I really need to boost my gpa up this semester. I can't wait to get my papa john's pizza, I am so hungry. Man I can't wait for Dele to get here tomorrow too. I miss him so much. he kind of pissed me off today though because when I was telling him about my crappy day he had to get off the phone with me. Well I giess I really shouldn't be that pissed off. I'm sure I have done it to him numerous times. that's why I like him, he put up with my BS. Wow its only been three minutes. I don't know if I can keep typing for 20. this is actually harder than I though. my mind is totally blank  right now. Well actually its not because if it was then I would be thinking anything, but I an think about how my mind is blank. so it's really not blank. Ok I think I'm making things a little complicated. oh my goodnes there is this weird noise coming from somewhere in my room. ughhhh these stupid dorms. . Mann I got to a lot of homework to do tonite. Well at least I'm getting one thing done. That's good. la la la. This is getting kind of old. I have about 13 minutes to go, whoops there is the phone I have to go get my pizza is ready. I hope I don't get counted off for this. Man I'm excited about this pizza. Mmmmm can't wait. Man I'm really excited to eat this pizza. Its going to be so good. Man the smell of it makes my mouth water. I'm going to keep writing a little more since I had to go get my pizza. I wonder if my mom called me back. I really don't want her to be mad at me because she gives me allownace on friday. Man that's bad for me to think that. but I was just kidding though. Man I love chicken pizza. Its so good.

‎     Im sitting in my room at the towers, and I have to admitt that the room size isnt half bad, ecspecially compared to my older sisters dorm room when she was a freshman. However I do have one complaint, and that is that the room are not taken care of in the least bit. And if I had to approximate the last time this place was renovated, my honest guess would be nineteen ninety-one. Yet I can live with a rather filthy room, but the worst part about living in the Towers has to be the food. The cooks here should go down in the Guiness Book of World Records for being the first people ever to make chicken taste bad. And everytime I go in there i seem to be asking the cook what exactly the food sitting in front of me is. Which through my experience translates into something that is not a good thing. As I look around my room I can't help but notice the fact that my side is far more messy than my roomates, but to be honest this is no concern of mine. Because he eats all of my food. I went pot luck in the towers for my roomates, which means that my rooming assignment is totally random. I havent really decided what my true feelings about my new roomates are due to the fact that we havent really spent time together. This fact is more my fault than it is theirs', because for one thing I am in pledgeship right now so finding time to spend with people is like finding a needle in a haystack. But every once in a while I do get to spend a little time with them, and from those few experiences I can say that Tony, the guy with whom I share a room with, is a very nice person and I believe that we will get along very well. So far the one thing that has kind of tied us together is that fact that we have the same taste in music, which is a major relief to me. My other two roomates who live across the living room from me are both going through pledge ship. And Campbell has been really nice as well, though he seems rather reserved. Yet the one guy that I am not to fond of at this time is my third roomate Joey. Its not that there is hostility between us its just that I try to be as nice as possible to him and try to start conversations with him every time I get yet he just won't seem to respond. Maybe its just a difference in the way we were brought up or something. Because I know when I was in high school this new guy moved in from Chicago and he really kept to himself along with his parents. But the more time I spent with him the more he opened up and now we are really good friends. But the‎stream of consciousness‎0

Little things I mean and he doesn't even see them but as long as I'm complaining about jeff at least I'm not going out with andy. I can't see how bret (my roommate who I know from highschool) can go out with him. He's such a close minded person. A lot of the time just a jerk. And everyone who meets him get's that first impression from him too. And I just think bret is way too good for him but for some reason she loves him and I know he loves her and he's not a bad guy but the other day talking about wanting to live with a gay guy like will and grace or be friends with a gay person he was like """"well then you'd just be condoning that life style"""" omg what a freakin aggie seriously, he's such a hick I can't believe he would be so close minded but he is and his ego is so huge and bret is pissed off at him all the time and the long distance relationship thing just isn't go to work so iwish she'd just dump him because I think he's a jerk. If he wasn't her bf I probably wouldn't even be friends with him. Yikes any way I can really get carried away on that issue . I miss going out to the barn everymorning. I'm afraid I'm going to gain weight because I don't have the motivation to jjust exercise and I don't dance everyday like I used to and I just ate two cups of ice cream and even though it's fat free bret says it still has like a jillion calories and I don't even really know what that means/entails but it sounds like something that will make me gain weight. And I guess I'm just really concerned with that. I also don't know about this whole sorority thing I'm a DG and the girls are great but sometimes I just wish that I had gotten a bid fro chi o because I spent like hours killing myself over that decision and I got DG in the end anyway.

By the way, I have to fill out my daily schedule for my EDP 310 class. Don't forget about that. It's kind of hard to type whatever comes into my head because my hands aren't as fast as my thoughts. (That's obviously a good thing). What's on my mind. This is a lot harder than I thought. Sometimes there is absolutely nothing in my head and I just draw a blank. Nothing to write about. I wish that I can draw pictures on this thing but I can't. I tend to be a more visual person and I get a lot more pictures in my head than words. I think I'm going a bit over twenty minutes, although it doesn't seem like it. I just sit here at my computer and think sometimes because I want something to pop in my head so I can write it down, but nothing happens. It seems like when you want your mind to wander, it has a harder time doing it, but if you're trying to concentrate on something, like when you're taking a test, your mind can't stop wandering. I guess that's the amazing thing about the brain. so unpredictable. At least to the untrained individual who doesn't know what to look for it seems unpredictable. Maybe not so much for an expert. Its funny how the mind works. Anyway, I don't want to get all philosophical or psychological or anything so I think that my time is up. Until next time.

He is the last thing i think about when i go to bed and of course i dream about him and hes the first thing i think about when i wake up. Another thing that is really neat about our relationship is that we do a bible study and devotional together every day. It really helps up to grow closer to eachother and to God who is number 1 in our relationship. My Christianity is really important to me. I was raisedin a Christian home and brought up in church. I am so greatful for my parents and all that they have taught me. They are also still married and i consider myself very lucky to have them since most people now are not as fortunate to have thier parents still together. Me and my mom are very close and i tell her a lot. We have a very open relationship and can depend on eachother for anything. She even gets these gut type feelings about things for example when I started dating David and he spent some time here at the house she told me one night that   she had a good feeling about this one.  meaning she really liked him and could see this relatioship lasting a long time. And so far she is right and i don't see her being wrong any time soon. I am glad that i still live at home while i am going to UT because I don't know where i would be without her. I am not very independent but i am working on that because i know i can not live at home forever.

I feel so much more secure. sure there were times when I would see people gathered in a huge group and think to myself that I wanted to join and be a part of it but when it comes right down to it, I am the kind of person who likes to have a couple of really close friends and then a lot of friends who I can say hi to and visit with on occasion. I really believe that that is okay. my boyfriend and I are great, I think it has a lot to do with the fact that I don't need to be with him all the time so we enjoy each other's company a lot when we are together because it is not so often. he sees me in a totally different light this year and I feel the same way about him. I wonder if Naomi is having a good time tonight with Ira. I think that she is trying to convince herself that she doesn't want any relationships with guys. I wonder if it bothers her that David is here. I hope not but I am not going to ban my boyfriend from coming to the apartment just because she doesn't have someone to come see her. I hope that isn't horrible. Hillel is going really well. it's going to be a really busy year I can already tell but I think that I can definitely handle it this year, I have the right mind set. the meeting last night was way to long though. who wants to sit in a chair for three hours discussing what seems like today as absolutely nothing!!! it was crazy. so many times I wanted to jump out of my chair and leave the room but I sat there and listened to all of the nonsense. this sorority thing is driving me crazy. on the one hand, it has the potential to be a lot of fun, on the other hand it is a huge time commitment and I am not sure if I want to put myself into something that leaves little time for anything else, on the other hand the old Kim wouldn't get involved at all because she would be too nervous. I don't want to be that Kim anymore. I never realized how hard it would be to write for twenty minutes.

In fact, it would be a good thing. It's pretty hot outside today. I have a horrible crick in my neck. Almost like I've been looking in the same direction for ages and never had my hinges oiled. When I look to the left, it all seems to go away. Perhaps I should start sitting on the other side of the classrooms. I should start studying more often. I passed my Computer Proficiency Test today. not like I was terribly worried about it though. I had my first quiz at UT today as well. I ended up reading for my Financial Accounting class for an hour and a half at the AIM reading room at the school of business. I did a few homework problems at the end, but didn't finish them. If I would have been reading for my MIS class, I probably would have been prepared for the quiz. It's pretty straightforward stuff though--especially with me being a certified Microsoft and Citrix network administrator. My roommate Chad has been really sketchy lately. I think it has to do with the fact that we moved in together as 'eligible bachelors' after both breaking up from serious relationships. DAMN, those Italian herbs smell really good. It's making my mouth start to water really bad. I took a painting class last semester and did a few works -- one of them is sitting on my desk and keeps catching my attention. I also have a double Dave's cup on my desk -- which is one of my favorite places to eat. I think I'm going to turn some music on now [empty thoughts] I'm now listening to the sound of 311 (their self titled album to be more specific) I wonder if you all will actually read these. My thought pattern seems to have become more spaced out since I've started listening to the music. Oop--now it's picking up again. I have a stack of CD's on top of my monitor. Do you?  Do you have a stack of anything?  I once saw a stack of hay at my friends ranch. The code to their ranch was 1991, because that's the year they purchased it. The funny thing is, he now incorporated that number plus the first initial of him, his mom, his dad, and his two dogs into being his screen name. This sucks that the time is going by so slowly. At first it seemed to pass by really quickly--with the lines of text slowly appearing, but the time going by in increments of 30 seconds. The spaghetti is ready. Damnit, I'm hungry but I have to sit here for a little while more and type to no one. I wonder why brass was chosen as a doorknob color. Maybe because it looks similar to gold -- and gold is a precious commodity. My stomach feels like‎stream of consciousness‎0
‎to be married, hopefully to aron, becuase we can do these things together becuase we both enjoy the same things. I also wish Josh was here, it would be so much easier. Hopefully he will get into college here and we can hang out more together. He is like a brother to me and will always be. I really miss him. Hopefully he will call back but I guess I will just call him again. Well these are all the things  I have been thinking about for the past couple of weeks. I think about these things all the time and just think it has only been 16 minutes. I wish all writing assignments were this easy. I need to sign up for more experiments so I don't get behind. I also need to do some passoffs. Hopefully if I study them well today I can do one tomorrow and one thurs and then one friday and the only have 12 left. That would be good. I wonder who is all coming home for homecoming? probably most people. I love my little town. I would not trade it for the world. Those that have lived there their whole lives don't appreciate it as much as I do but they will some day. I am really glad my mom married walter and that we moved there. I like it that I live here cause my dad visits a lot. My family is awesome. They do so much for me and I thank God I have them. You know another thing that bugs me about here is that so many people are liberals. What is this world coming to?  I am so voting for Bush! """‎stream of consciousness‎0

‎I really don't have a clue what to write about but I guess I'm supposed to think of what I'm feeling which is that my tank top's straps are really bugging me because they keep falling down and I keep looking at the pictures on my desk instead of the screen and what I am writing my refrigerator keeps making an annoying buzzing sound but I am concentrating on it anyway since I have to keep in touch with my senses. I keep staring at these pictures like I'm afraid to look at the screen or something it is a picture of me and my two friends from high school in our bathing suits acting like morons. there is also a lot of dust on my desk and on the picture frames and I really think I should clean them off, but I am pretty lazy so I doubt I will do that there is dust on everything around my computer!. the printer, the keyboard, the mouse pad, the phone and the pictures. my neck keeps itching; its probably from the dust or something. I can't believe I've only been typing for three minutes. this is going to be a very long paper, but this assignment is definitely a lot more fun than all the other ones in my other classes. uhoh the phone is ringing and I don't know whether to pick it up or not! I guess I can't because that would be breaking the rules! so I didn't and now it stopped and a really loud voice came on the answering machine of course the message wasn't for me I already had my really really good and nice phone calls for the day. I guess you could call me one of those losers that really misses home. I miss my boyfriend and my friends in the picture on my desk and my dad. and I miss my mom, but she's not at home, at least not technically because she's dead. this should be interesting to see where this thought leads because I have noticed in myself that whenever I think about my mom my brain won't let me and it starts thinking about something else like what I will wear tomorrow or something totally irrelevant. my mom was nice and I have a picture of her in my room but I can't really see it from where I am now because it's above my bed it makes me sad to think about her and when I do, like now, it makes me want to cry. I think that my brain realizes I will be too sad when I think about it so it won't let me. that is kind of nice of it, but sometimes when I just want to think about it, it won't let me. now my wrists are hurting from typing so fast for so long and my back is itching and it is getting very hot in here our room is always hot. my mom was always hot and we had to keep our‎stream of consciousness‎0
‎It is now 12:32 and so I cannot wait until 12:52 because at that time my writing will be done. I type slowly anyway so I shouldn�t have too much trouble typing for twenty minutes and producing much of a paper. I am not thinking about much at the moment except for the fact I am hungry and stressed out. The first week or two of school seemed pretty easy and then all of the sudden, yesterday it hit me. I am in college and at this point I need to get my priorities straight. I am enjoying myself too much and need to have more focus. My mind is just wondering a million miles a minute about nothing in particular. I need a job, but I�m so busy with school and stuff with my sorority, which is another story. I am not the proudest to be in a sorority. Don't get me wrong, it's a great honor and a fun time, but I don't like the whole association that comes with it. My whole life does not revolve around guys and partying and allowing myself no friends or life outside of the sorority, as many of them do. In fact, I like so many people outside my sorority and would like to get to know them better that it makes me wonder if this is a good, more importantly, healthy fit for me?  I love Austin because of it's diversity and that became one of the main factors in choosing schools between SMU and here. There are so many interesting people and I want to get to know them all or at least try. Wow, it's already been over 10 minutes and this has not been too hard. I used to write daily in my journal at home, but haven�t had too much spare time to do that here, so maybe that is why I have been able to do this, and express myself so well. I enjoy so much being able to express myself on paper, which may explain why I write so much-journal, letters, poems. It helps me gain a sense of relief and since I don' express my feelings out loud too often, I need to do this daily, if not more so I can release all that I feel. I am excited about doing psychology this year because I hope to decide between the two majors I am struggling with. I am at the moment down for premed/nutrition and I really do want to go into medicine, but I've also always been interested in criminal psychology. It may be a little depressing, but I find it very interesting, and definitely want a job I love. A few months back, I read Helter Skelter and this encouraged my psychology path a little more, so I am hoping this class will help with my decision making. I guess we'll see. It is 12:51 now and time for me to stop. ‎stream of consciousness‎0
‎   Well for some reason I am stressing out about everything that is going on in the first few weeks of school! Not only are classes overwhelming and so much different than high school because of number of students in each class, but I am in a whole new city! For the first time I am away from my family trying to make my own choices, doing my own laundry, making my own food, and trying to make new friends. I am scared about being able to study too! And I am scared about failing. I also just went through Rush and I am in a sorority which is also very overwhelming. We just had a meeting and we have to keep a certain GPA, finish many hours of volunteer work and stay at the house for at least 10 hours a week to study there. We also have mixers twice a week at night. I don't know how I ma going to manage all of these things at once. I am also stressing about finding where to live next year. I had a deposit down for an apartment with a girl I met during the summer, but the more I got to know her, the more I knew I couldnt live with her. So now I am trying to find a group of nice girls and find a place to live before they are all taken. Not to mention my ex boyfriend is here and things between us are very complicated. I wish he could communicate with me and tell me how he really feels because I am tired of playing all these stupid games! We keep trying to make each other jealous, but I really care about him alot. OHHH and I am getting sooooooo fat! I swear our older sorority sisters want to keep giving us cookies, cake, and candy to make us fatter! I don't have time to excercise. But I really love it here and I know I am going to have so much fun! I have already met several awesome girls that are so fun to hang out with. And since I came from a small baptist schoool its interesting to meet so many different kinds of people. I love how UT is so diverse. I love my roommate too. I went pot luck and was kind of nervous about that but we are perfectly matched. We are both neat freaks and have the same personality. I hope we become great friends, so far we have talked about everything. She is really smart too. I miss my best friends from high school. Two of them went to Baylor, I was baout to go there with them but I loved UT. It was a hard choice to make though. The only person I really knew here were a few older girls that went to my high school and my ex boyfriend. . who is frustrating me! I couldnt sleep at all last night because I was upset with him!

‎"""Right now, I am very busy. I am very preoccupied by trying to balance my academic studies with my social life. Joining a fraternity is a very difficult thing to do, as it entails choosing a group of people who are most like you, in that they share common ideals and interests. Outside of my world at the University of Texas, I am also struglling to maintain a long distance relationship with the woman who could possibly grow to become my wife. She attends the University of Alabama, and she is also an incoming freshman. However, my troubles are very different than hers. Yes, she joined a serority, but the Greek process that involves women is wholly differnt than the one concerning men. But what is important is that she has already become an active member of a serority, a serority in which she already grown a liking to many active members. I, on the other hand, have just begun my process of joining a fraternity, and is not only stressful but very intimidating. In my opinion, older men are simply more imtimidating and less likely to accept new members than older women. This process of distancing ourselves from each other and the process pf maing new friends, indpendenet of one another, has taken its toll on the quality of our relationship. We often argue, our telephone conversations are usually brief and superficial, and we lack a common ground on which to converse. I am worried than our relationship will not withstand the tests of time and distance, which is the most bothersome thing of all. My feelings for her are still intense, yet they no longer stand forefront in my mind. Now, I have other academic as well as social predicaments to fill uo my time. I worry that she is experiencing the same phenomenon. In addition, I am thinking of how alone I feel in this problem. My roomate does share a similar experience, and I can subsequently not look to him for guidance or advice. I don't want my feelings tp change towards Christel, but I fear that they will, and we will eventually encounter a mutual break-up, but one after which we cannot remain friends. Digressing on a tangent, I can stare out my window as I type this essay, a look out onto the hiils of Austin. Coming from Dallas, I have grown to appreciate Austin's attractive landscape. It hills, its sunsets, and other natural phenomenons sometimes offer a sense of peace during such a hectic time. My roomate is always creating some kind of noise. As I sit here and try to complete this assignment, he is playing a game of football on the Sony Playstation. Does he not have homework to do?  I don't know, I guess that it bothers me sometimes that I feel and seem so busy when those around me seem carefree and happy. Will I ever feel completely happy again? In the near future?

‎"""I am supposed to write for twenty minutes while I track my thoughts. I am looking down at my watch right now to check the current time. It is 3:30, and unfortunately I have to miss my calculus discussion class at 4:30 due to a chemistry review for a test I have on Thursday, the 14th. Apocolyptica, a string quartet who plays music written by the rock group Metallica, is actually playing on my computer while I write this. I am also ripping one of my compact discs via my computer so I can listen to it while not actually having the CD in the ROM drive. Sometimes I like to think about how technology has changed in the last few years. It is absolutely incredible. In junior high school, I had no idea what the Internet was, nevertheless how to use it. Now, I sit at my computer and I will turn in this paper simply by pasting it into a box and clicking a small button. How does the information get to the desired location? I suppose the words are somehow converted into 0s and 1s using the binary number system. Still, the entire concept is simply amazing. What is in store for technology in the future? Hover cars? Now there is a concept. I come from Houston, which is not only the most polluted city in the United States but also has a mighty big traffic problem. I think I will switch my music to Beethoven. There we go. Anyway, with the help of cars that """"float"""" above other vehicles, pileups would be significantly less common. However, there would probably be more accidents, for the concept of cars above a driver adds a completely new depth to driving. Now instead of just having to watch in front, back, and adjacent, one would now have to be careful of who was above him. This would definitely cause some major problems. Maybe hover cars are not such a good idea. The song has now switched to Holst's Mars. My friend Cody has the score to this piece at his dorm at the University of Houston because he is a music major. A bunch of my friends and I are going to see the Dave Matthews concert in Houston in a couple of days. I have seen the DMB perform two previous times at the Woodlands Pavilion, and they were incredible. However, the band has not come out with an album containing new songs in quite a while. They will be coming out with a new album very soon, so I assume they will play many songs from this album in this concert coming up. Well, twenty minutes has just expired, so I will sign off now.

I should also say that I only have one arm to type this because the other one is in a cast so I probably wont write as much as everyone else. although have a lot of homework to do tonite, I'm happy because I only have one class tomorrow and then the weekend is here and I don't have any classes to go to. I'm also happy that this is such an easy assignment and that we get credit for it. my roomate is bothering me quite a bit at the moment cause he wont shut up. I really don't like him very much, but at least he is just my roomate and I don't have to hang out with him. now I hope that he doesn't see what I wrote. I'm excited about this weekend cause it will be time to get away from school. I don't know or care what I'm doing though. maybe I shouldnt feel this way so early in the year, but I just don't feel like doing all of the work I have to do for school, I would rather just sit in the living room and watch tv and relax. I'm tired now and I feel like going to sleep, but the nthought of my math hw wont let me relax until it is all done. now I'm wondering if someone is actually going to read all of these writing assignments, I feel sorry for whoever has to do that, but I guess they are divided up between the ta's. my twenty mins is almost up so I'm thinking about what I'm goin g to write for the next ass. well twenty mins is up now, so goodbye. ‎stream of consciousness‎0

‎and cheering for the longhorn football team was one of the greatest moment I have ever saw because I have never attended a college football game before. It was quite hot and I was wearing jeans which was dumb of me. I definitely learn my lesson and will wear shorts to all the day games. I might even paint my face to show some school spirit. Maybe not. After I finish this assignment, I will have to start working on my English paper which is due next Thursday. I kind of have a idea of what to write about but it might take awhile before I fully understand the assignment. The good thing about it is that my teacher is very nice and she will be willing to help me if I need it. My EDP teacher also mentioned a writing center which I could go to if I have problems starting an idea or need my paper to be edited. I think that is cool because in high school, there wasn't a writing center that would help you with your paper. You had to go to the teacher for help and sometimes they make you do all the thinking even when you don't have a clue. I guess that's one of the luxuries for being in college because people want you to succeed and that's a great feeling to have. The one thing I keep on forgetting to do is to buy my psy book. I may have to run by co-op and see if they have it since BEVO's was out of them. Textbooks are very expensive in college, but it's probably worth it when it comes to things you don't understand or for the test. The good thing is that you can resale them back to the store. I think my time is up so that's all I'm going to write. I think I changed the subject like 6 different times but I think that's the purpose of this essay. So, that's all.   ‎stream of consciousness‎0

‎psychology in high school, and it was way different. My teacher bored us to death, and we learned practically nothing. It was the easiest class ever!  I am going home to Houston this weekend, which is very exciting because all my friends from different colleges are coming home, too. We are all going to go see Clay Walker, my favorite country singer. My ex-boyfriend will also be in town. I haven't seen him in over two months. He goes to West Point in New York and had to leave in late June. I talk to him every once in awhile, but I miss him so much. We are still great friends, and I can't wait to see him again. We dated for a year and three months, so its strange not to see him at all anymore. This gum is really ready to be thrown away, but I'll wait for my four more minutes to do so. I have one more class today, and that is a study hall calculus. Those are never stressful, since the T. A. just helps us with some problems like our homework. He's a nice guy. The first time all we did was say our names and stuff like that, but I'm sure we'll actually accomplish something today. At least I hope so. Getting to know people is good, but I really needed some help with a couple of those problems!  Well, I guess it has been twenty minutes, so I better go. Hope anyone who reads this is having a great time!  :) ‎stream of consciousness‎0

This whole college thing is really starting to scare me I missed my Si session today for Rtf and let myself down. I f you want to make an impression on these people you have to grab them by the balls with a 4. 0 average. How am I going to do that when I have already missed one of the damn Si's  I'm telling you I better get my act  What am I even doing here I need to get my mind on other things like movies why aren't your thoughts ever on movies they're always on what to do to impress the next person . Just get ahead of thy game early and you'll do fine  God I hope I get a $. 0. $. 0 the way to go. I don't want grad school though California Vivian Yeah that's where I'm going to be in a while no matter what. I have it the right stuff. Ed Harris. Good movie. Remember what the guy at Northwestern said The Right Stuff had god use of parallel editing. where you edit two frames together that are similar in how the shot is set so as not to disrupt the audience's attention. What is the audience's attention . Movies. this paper what am I rambling about I wonder if the proff will read this Jesus you type like a gorilla . Sigourney Weaver Gorillas in the Mist about some ape lady Aldrich something. Ironic that was in our psychology book. ironic but not funny just ironic sue me I took a pause to see how much time I had left this is all anyway what is it supposed to prove that our mind wanders is it supposed to give us some great insight into how we think  rrAAh. it is pretty fun and it will be interesting to read over this am I supposed to wow I'm a slow typist that sucks. What was it sophomore year that I got a B in keyboarding yeah I told Chad Crady about Stephanie McKinnon and we always used to fight each other in class and he'd pretend that I was beating him up why are you and all of these people so concerned about each other especially women is it just to procreate that we are interested in women or is it like Psychology. professor says that there can be different views on the whole thing.

I could probably go back to HEB cause I mean they don't pay that poorly. possibly even be a CCM or something so that I could bring a little extra dough in. I would try hard to at least get a job at a radio station. I wonder how long u have to work at one before they give u your own show. I should also go to the radio station tomorrow to see if I could get some kind of spot in there. even if it wasn't a show, but a technical thing. okay so when it comes to homework what should I do so that I have somewhat of a schedule. if I sleep in the mornings, or at least plan to, I don't think I should try scheduling that in. what I should probably try to do is try to be strict to making sure I get hw done first before I do anything else. because then I could go to sleep sooner too and then maybe this job wouldn't be too bad. cause that's probably my problem, the fact that I don't go to sleep early enough. I want to go to midnight rodeo this Saturday, I just wish roger creager wasn't playing there. remember to call leah tomorrow to tell her mom about staying out later. back to study. monday and wednesdays should be too bad hw wise becuase all I have is my writing class EASY, and Spanish, so getting out late on those days isn't too bad. Tuesdays and thursdays I should try to make sure I am done with hw by like 6, cause then I could go eat after I did my hw. that's a pretty good plan. only on occasions should I change that up. what I mean by that is like being invited to do stuff, never let it be online poker or TV that distracts me, that includes playing xbox. even if I think I have had a hard day so far, just think how more satisfying that resting will be once I have everything done, I mean knowing u don't have anything left to do is a nice feeling. this writing this is going by faster than I thought. I didn't know I had all this stuff on my mind. I think it would be nice to have a 6pac on my body, and some muscle. you know, it really does kind of upset me that leah doesn't want me hanging out with females alone. I find that it shouldn't matter.

I do not know i just hope that my mom doen not get that mad, i hope she understands a little. i guess that for now i just need to enjoy myself until my mom finds out what is going on. when she doe i know things are going to blow up she will tell my dad, and i really do not want him to find out yet, you see my dad is depressed, the whole divorce thing i mentioned earlier, and he says i am like his friend he says that i am the only person he can talk to just about anything i think that when he finds out his whole world will just fall apart even more than it is already. i am just trying to make the best out of my life i am happy withn the way it is going and i really do not care if they do  not agree with the way i am living it. as long as i get my stuff done they should not worry about me, i hate when people say don't get married because then you won't go back to school i will prove all them wrong i will teach them, i know that you can do anything you want when you put your mind to it ‎stream of consciousness‎0

‎effect on me. It's interesting to  meet so many people around the world that are absolutely amazing, and they may not even  know it. They're absolutely amazing to me, and I don't even know why. It's awesome. I wish I  could keep in touch with someone halfway across the world for a long time. I need to find  someone first. Maybe if I get to study abroad in Italy I'll find someone to keep in touch with. Things always seem to get in the way of stuff like that, every day life I guess. I don't know what  it is. I do have this one friend, Marcus, I've kept in touch with him for about two years now. I  met him at a medical program one summer, and we've kept in touch since. That summer I did  lots of stuff. I went to Canada for World Youth Day, and I got to see the pope. Some people got  really emotional about that. They were crying and stuff. I kind of felt bad because I wasn't  crying, but I know there really is no reason I should feel guilty. God did not say, """"Thou shall be  overwhelmed with emotion upon seeing the pope and come to tears. """"  hah it would be kind of  funny if it said that in the bible. Anyway, that summer I also went to LDZ. That was one of the  greatest experiences ever. I've stumbled upon a few people here at UT that said, """"You were  governor at LDZ, right?"""" It's pretty cool how lives cross. There are so many people at UT, who  wouldn't you find?  ha-ha The Monday before classes started I had an audition to try out for the  longhorn singers and we were in this tiny room in the music building, and who should walk in  the door but M. C. Hammer himself!! Hahira It was hilarious!! He was apparently showing his  daughter around because she wanted to get in choir at UT. That's definitely a story worth  telling. I didn't recognize him. I'm to young I guess. I always figured M. C. Hammer was white  only because I knew Vanilla Ice was. ha-ha  Anyway, this whole time I've been writing I've also  been thinking about Alex. Alex (in one sentence) is the boy I've been in love with almost my  entire life. The reason why I've been thinking about him now is because a lot of the times I  write anything in journals or about what I'm thinking it's usually about him. I know this is  simply """"stream of consciousness"""" but I guess I can't just write what I'm thinking without  thinking of him. Recently he wrote me an email after I hadn't emailed him in a while. I was  waiting for him to write me. It was short and mostly insignificant, but he wrote. I just want to  be friends, I think.‎stream of consciousness‎0

‎"""Ok well this seems like an informal assignment, so I'm going to treat it that way. And presently I have a bone to pick with women. I'm going to let you know about a little situation I have undergone recently, and see if I can figure out why women are so weird. Ok so first off, I had this girl, we'll call her Jessica, that I have been in love with since 8th grade but never got a chance to pursue. As a background on her, she is a player; meaning that she likes to lead guys on, then break their hearts. But she still had me swooning over her for some reason. She has been my best friend for almost 2 years and so I this summer I decided to give it a shot and ask her out, after all I had nothing to lose. So I asked her out, and she said no because: """"the timing is wrong, college is coming up and I don't want to start anything because I like you so much that I think it would actually be a relationship and not just a game for me"""". So this gets me mad and so I just decided to play along with her and hope she would eventually give in to let me have just 1 date with her. Throughout the summer I continued to pursue her with minimal success. She then left off to school and I never got my chance. Then 2 weeks ago she came and stayed with me and we ended up making out all night long for no apparent reason at all. It was very out of the ordinary, but I wasn't going to complain because I liked her so much. So she started acting really weird after that day, and just ignored me. When I confronted her last night, she told me """" I just don't know what to think, I just thought of you as my best friend, and then that all happened and I don't know why and I enjoyed it but I feel strange now. """" So of course she is just saying this because she wants to maintain control over my feelings and keep me here in case she can't get a date in school up where she goes. I don't like this idea though, so I conjured up a plan that would stop this. She just loves to play mind games so I started playing mind games back, by leading her on and then just not talking and some various other tactics. Eventually I won and she stopped being weird, but last night when I confessed that I was doing the mind game thing to get back at her, she went haywire and got all mad because """"I took control of her feelings with no care whatsoever"""". So my dilemma and all I can think about now is why women are so weird. Not only is she a strange girl, but my ex girlfriend is also adding to my confusion. She is also attending UT‎stream of consciousness‎0

‎My love for computers and hate for computers is simultaneously growing as I sit here and write this assignment. I don't understand any software but everything for IBM, and the Macintosh is completely foreign to me. I must have already asked at least 30 questions regarding the system, but hey I am new to this whole Apple thing. Apple should just get rid of itself entirely and sell itself to Microsoft and the computer world will be a lot happier. Every time I type the word a lot, I am reminded of my English teacher in 10th grade, or maybe it was 9th who dispelled the myth that a lot was one word. I'll begin to type it as one, but then realize that I should have written it as two. I think it is really strange how some teachers you remember their words, but cannot remember their names or faces. I see a lot of people around campus just like that although I remember their faces and words, for the life of me I cannot remember their names, and I would fell absolutely terrified if they were to come up to me and use the overly cliched phrase, Azi, do you remember me?? More than likely I would not, or I would be to involved in my own thoughts to try to recall who the individual standing before me was. I do that a lot. People will have said that they may have called my name 3 or 4 times before I responded by just looking up. My thoughts consume me sometimes. I have a problem with daydreaming. I know that it is not necessarily a bad thing, but nonetheless it can get in the way of a lot of really important things. It is a good thing that in this particular assignment, daydreaming is the foundation for all my thoughts, and will assist me in coming up with ideas to write. I was talking about my thoughts, and how I daydream. Well, lately all I can think about is the perfect scenario for me to meet the man I am to marry. It seems foreign, and should probably not clutter the mind of a Freshmen in college, but it has been particularly bothered me. I have only really been involved in one serious relationship, if it can even be called that, and that in itself was a summer fling. I went to a summer church retreat, and I think this is where everything started to form, regarding marriage, because I met guys for the first time that I could honestly see myself marrying. This has never happened before, and as I glance around the campus, I just don't see them there, and it frustrates me knowing that they are somewhere else, and I am here longing for there company. It is not like I need there company, no yes it is that was a lie. I miss them a whole lot because I have never, ever been able to relate to a guy like the guys that I met‎stream of consciousness‎0

I don't know how people do it every night!  I am so worn out every day!  I just need to take a few days off to sleep. I am so mad that our zeta retreat is the weekend of austin city limits!  I have to get out of it somehow. my stomach kind of hurts right now, and I really need to go running, so I hope it goes away. my friend megan has an eating disorder I think. she constantly tells us how much weight she is lost recently, and its getting so annoying. I really miss zachary. thank god he called and woke me up this morning or else I would have never woken up. and I really miss my dog. I think I have an unhealthy relationship with my dog. thank god I'm taking psychology. haha I literally miss her more than my parents!  I hope fiji is fun tonight. it probably will be. I always have the most fun with the fiji guys. they are so nice and fun to hang around with. it is such a nice day outside. I would much rather be out enjoying it then writing this. just kidding!  it was not cool last night when so many people came into my room and woke me up! I was in such a deep sleep too! no wonder I was tired this morning. okay now my roommate is going outside. just like I wanted to!  she is cool as shit. she is just so herself, and I think that's awesome. sometimes I wish I could be more like that. I am a fairly independent person, but I know I follow the trend a lot too. I hope I do well at the tryouts for the dance team. that would be so cool! I miss dance so much!  I can't believe I quit - I am such an idiot! dance was always such an outlet for me and when I quit, things kind of started going downhill, so hopefully I can start back up. I seriously think I've gained the freshman 100!  for some reason when I get stressed out I start to eat. a lot. I need to get control!  I think its so funny how all of the girls from hardin house and srd are constantly at towers. I love living here, it is so free and fun all the time. it's so weird how music means so much to some people and so little to others. I think I'm kind of in between.

‎There are mostly worries and fear traveling through my mind at the moment. The college stress has really kicked in now that classes have started and much work is to be done. The work is really bothering me in that the level of it is so high. There are many other factors in my stress including being away from home. In the whole 18 years of my life I have never been away from home without my family for this long amount of time. I guess I just miss all the little things about being at home-the comfort, luxery, friends, family, and not to exlude food!  I have eaten Chinese food most of my life and I can say that the dorm food I do not find to satisfying. And the life of college is so different from my previous school experience. UT is so big and so diverse that it's kind of difficult to adjust to. Some people are friendly whiles others may not be. Failure is also a concern for me. I have always done well in school and my parents have high expectations for me to succeed here in college. I miss all my friends and always think about the past and all the good times. I guess I must start all over here and make new friends and continue all the good times. After all, college is supposes to be the best time of one's life. I also think about what I will end up after college-where I'll work and who I will hang out with and if I will graduate here in Austin. My past two weeks here in Austin have been decent. I have been doing many different things like shooting pool or just hanging out with friends or going clubbin in 6th ST. Also I have been busy I might add. The people I have met are very similar to me personality wise. And most of them are from my home town of Houston. I have noticed that there are many different groups of poeple here. I guess the homework load is as much as I expected before I started coollege but there are so many activites to attend to that I find it hard to complete all the work. That is when stress kicks in again and I end up just trying to rush through it. The class sizes are amazing larger than I expected them to be although I knew that UT is the largest school int he nation population wise. I fear that I will not perform as well in school due to all the distractions that goes on like friends wanting to go out and the many places to go to like 6th ST for example. I guess I will adjust to this environment eventually but when I will I am not sure. Rest has also been an issue in my mind as I have trouble sleeping at night when I have early classes the next morning. I am very tired the next day having to walk so much‎stream of consciousness‎0

Why am I dizzy sometimes. I need to write. Seriously write. Like I used to. It always made me feel so much better. and my teachers loved it. What on earth is this chick next to me doing? I really HATE it when people look at my monitor when I am trying to do this. PET PEAVE. Or when there are like 500 computers open and she has to come sit right next to ME. I like lightning. It's so beautiful. I like rain. I want to go play in it. I don't ever want to grow up. I hope this phone doesn't get me in trouble. I really need to get my computer fixed. It's so dead. So am I.

‎     311, I never actually listened to them. man my eyes itch. wow, Im supposed to be typing instead of talking to Arturo. Man, this song is so melodic and soothing. It reminds me of sandy beaches and sunshine. Well anyway this is college, dorms filled with all of the decor of people's personalities and homes from their towns. Sometimes I wonder why people are the way they are. It's quite complex and difficult, but I'm sure their environment had a lot to do with their personalities and social qualities. I truly believe that social qualities mean a lot. People need to understand that everyone is different and because, don't read this  Adan. The song has changed into a classical melody and by the same band, oh no, Tool. Music, is a language everyone can speak. You can't go wrong with music. It's a huge part of my life. wow, Aenima ( tool song) is redone with orchestra instruments. Aenima is an interesting song about Armageddon. Speaking of Armageddon, is God going to come to Earth, or Jesus for that matter. Biologically, we are just organisms living out our lives. And for what?  To not sin and go to heaven?  There are so many religions out there, I mean, controversy is going to be a given. Why is John reading this. Is he interested in what is on my mind. Well anyway, Respect for other's religions is something I find extremely important and essential to understand at the University of Texas at Austin. Instead of looking at a muslim and saying   holy shit what's up with that   just think to yourself how they see your religion and judge yourself. Live, and let live. Have respect. I feel as though people close to me in my home in Rockport do not realize the respect I have for them. They never realize, is this the same orchestrated song by tool, hold for 1 sec please. Alright some middle time AFI, their a gothic punk band, that can be described as purity in darkness. They are one of my favorite punk bands. Sometimes I wonder what the lives of Davey Havok and Afi are like. They seem as though they are really nice people. Having taken a picture and briefly and nervously talked to them. Yeah Bob Marley, a legend. Now thats good stuff. I mean who doesnt like Bob Marley?  His music flows through your body like the many pints of blood do. You just want to sit back and enjoy a nice beverage, for me preferably corona and a nice tequila of some sort. Not partying or whatever; it's wierd how we use party as a verb. Buffalo soldier in a war for America. Bob Marley used his fair share of pot, but he did not die from it. Who dies from cannibus?  Is it really that bad?  Should we legalize it?

It's hard for me because I don't have a car at UT. I wondering what he's doing right now can't wait to see his face. My friend just burned a new DJ cd that just released and some of the songs are actually ok but a lot of it is not that good. I miss my family. Its funny how when I'm at home I wish that I was away from home because my family tend to annoy and get on my nerves at time, but when I'm actually away I wish I was home. My roommate just finished talking to this guy she's dating. He calls her a lot. It's funny because that's how it was with me and my boyfriend when we were 'talking. '  He would call me all the time. My friends are studying in my dorm right now. I feel so lazy. I'm behind in a lot of classes and I havn't been doing a lot of studying this week. I need to push myself to study before I screw up my GPA again. Speaking of school, it's only my second year in college and I wish that it would over. I mean I like college and all like the friends you meet, the parties, and the school spirit. I just hate classes and studying. My friend is singing right now and it's so hilarious because he has a monotone voice and when he sings you can't tell that he has a monotone voice and when he sings its like he gives it his all. Its so funny. By the way the DJ cd that we burned is called DJ Prada G. It's like the DJ is trying to make his name unique like making it sound like 'prodigy' but spelled differently. Hmmm. Twenty minutes sure is going by slow. I have an ortho appointment this Monday so I'm going to miss calculus which is'nt too bad because I can borrow the notes from my friend. I need to go shopping this weekend; I am so out of clothes to wear. Five more minutes. This assignment isn't too bad. When are we going to eat?  I need to start packing.

‎I feel cold, my toes are really brittle feeling, I want to get in my bed right now, it is so warm in there, I feel closest to home went I am under my covers trying to sleep, the best feeling ever in the world is being really cold and then jumping into a warm bed that is what I want right now, if my new dorm wasn't so cold I wouldn't be rambling about this topic but wow is it cold although I do enjoy is freezing at night during the day I wouldn't mind a little heat I mean come on now at camp all summer it is so warm I just want to burst every time I walked outside I got that amazing warm sensation over my whole body I remember it so clearly that thawing feeling well I who'll get my hopes up here I am now in college in the cold away from friends and family and camp but I shouldn't feel so isolated sitting in this cold and unhomely room well I should this place is absolutely depressing ha-ha that is so funny how in class we talk about depression and more sleep is associated with it and I totally know that I will be napping after this assignment but no really college is the time of your life or so I am told but so far my two weeks at ut have not been the greatest of my life but then again I have herd stories about people coming here and not liking it for awhile and then they magically start to have fun this is not a cry for help by the way you know the one you warned us about not writing because it would not be read well that is not what this is I am just thing about me and how different I am it is strange the qualities I posses I always think that I am unique and different but there are a million people out there one has to be like me but the more I think about myself the more I am convinced that there is absolutely no one else like me on one side I feel lonely but realistically I love my friends because of the differences between us I feel like all I have is me with your best friends you can tell them anything in the world about how you are feeling and you can trust them and now all those people are gone and when I talk to them on the phone it is just not the same and we seem to be growing a greater distance apart wow I just realized what a sob story this is this is not a cry for help at all what roommate just walked in and totally broke the sob story train I mean he is a nice guy and all and we will get alone fine and everything for a whole year but I definitely don't think that we will be best friends or anything‎stream of consciousness‎0
‎I�m tired, stressed and I really don't feel all that good right now. my stomach hurts but I�m tired. I feel pressured. pressure from everywhere. school, work, life. how do I know what I�m doing with my life is what I was meant to do?  I love amy she means the world to me. I wish that I hadn't broke up with her last year. it ruined a lot of things in my life. but I thought that I would be happier with someone else and I was for a short period of time but not a day went by that I didn't think about amy and wonder if she is really the one. I miss my grandpa who died on the first day of school this year. I�ve had a really tough time dealing with his death. I guess I just thought that he would never die. after all grandparents aren't supposed to (I think). I just have a hard time dealing with death. but paw paw is most assuredly in heaven right now looking down on me making sure I�m living my life as a Christian. I will see him again, I know!  the thing is that paw paw really loved amy and she loved him. we were together for almost two years before I broke up with her for selfish reasons which I never found out what they were. I hate to be alone so I started dating janna who is a nice girl but I knew that it was all wrong but I enjoyed the companionship,  which is wrong but was good because it helped me to realize that amy is the one for me. the one that I want to spend the rest of my life with. paw paw knew it. how ironic it was that I broke up with janna only one day before paw paw died and began seeking love from amy. he would have wanted us together. but I messed up and things are hard now,   she still loves me but she is afraid to trust me. I need her!  ‎stream of consciousness‎0

‎I don't really understand. I am supposed to track my thoughts and feelings?  Write about anything as long as it is for twenty minutes?  OK. I kind of miss my old life at home, but I was so looking forward to moving on to other things. I have a friend that just went into the Army last month and I will never see him again. Other friends have gone off to college and moved away. Life is starting to change a great deal. I work for a company called Vector selling Cutco, or at least I did this summer, and we had conventions every now and then. I would always make friends from around the country, but end up never seeing them again. People don't keep in touch with each other like they should. I try to stay in touch with my friends and people that I meet. It is often difficult, though. I don't know. I am really thirsty right now. I was thinking of going up to my room first to get a drink, but I didn't figure they would let you bring drinks in here, and I didn't want to wait to get this done. I have waited long enough. I need to stop putting things off. I need to get things done. I guess it is just lack of motivation. Well that and lack of a computer. This is the first time I have been in the computer lab here at Jester. I am really thirsty and my throat is dry. I need to get this e-mail thing worked out. I haven't tried to use it yet. I might do that when I am finished with this. I wish that things could be the way they were, but then I don't. You know how sometimes something happens and you just want to freeze that moment in time and never leave. That has happened to me recently. Not since I have been at UT, but before, when I was with my friends. I like to spend time with my friends because they make me feel comfortable. I like to be around them because it is just very uplifting. My arm is starting to get tired because I don't have the right kind of writing area. It is uncomfortable in here. I need to go get a drink, but I still have a lot of time to keep writing, so I won't. I wish I had a computer so I could get things done on my own time. Life would be a whole lot easier, I think. I think I should go home and see my dog before the neighbors try to steal him again. If I don't pay enough attention to him he goes to stay at the neighbors house. They decided one day that they liked him and they were just going to keep him. They tried to give me an ultimatum (I don't know how to spell that word). They said that if I didn't give them the dog, then they did not want‎stream of consciousness‎0

I'm in the natural sciences thing as an undeclared pre-med right now, but who knows howl ong that will last?  I'm not lazy, but it takes me a hwile to get readjusted into going back to school. And even though I was in two ap classes my senior year and I graduated valedictorian by a long shot, I never had to work TOO hard in school. This stuff just came naturally to me.

‎Thins are so different. THere are so many people everywhere. I knew that 51000 people went to this school but i did not realize the implications of having to walk around on campus with every single on of them. I was way excited to move to Austin, I mean. I came from New Braunfels. I miss my friends, I miss the parties, I miss 'drive-bys' and TJs and the movies. I miss Twister and Busdriver and Presidents and Assholes. I got in the hugest fight with my best friend in the entire world. It just seems to me like there are some things that just shouldnt be said. You say things in confidence and expect them to remain in confidence. I only told her because I felt obligated because shes my best friend. its the kind of thing you're supposed to tell a best friend. I never imagined in a thousand years that it would get to everybody and their dog in less than a day. She has never betrayed me like that before. I wonder why she did now. I want to leave this room, but everybody is out. in class or at some meeting or something. I've adjusted much better than I thought I would. Maybe because I was prepared to move on. I miss my friends, but all of us realize that the past was in the past. althought its going to be a helluva party come Homecoming. Thats another thing. I miss my dad, the funny man, the journalist who used words like helluva in his articles. I should miss my mom, I think, but I miss my dad more. quite a bit more. I guess because he never failed me. Aw and my dogs. Jonas is so adorable, hes probably lost without me. Man, I can just imagine how pathetic that sounds. 6th Street! A whole bunch of us are going to 6th street tomorrow night. I have no idea what to wear. Michaels all worried about what I wear. hey, he's in New Braunfels, theres no way he can tell me what to wear. not that i really let him before. hes just not here to watch over me and other guys anymore. Anyway. off to 6th street. I love 6th street. I could just stand there and look at people for hours. People crack me up. We took a picture with Leslie the transvestite the last time we were there. My dad loved it, he'd actually heard of Leslie, the mayoral candidate. I think I got lucky as far as roommates go. Man, my friend ( you know, the one who betrayed me) got the roommate from hell. They go to Baylor, and this girl is so rich. The only problem is that she knows it;  I have never seen a more overbearing, holier than thou attitude. I told her I went to UT and she goes ''Ugh, public schools  . I just about smacked her. I guess the only reason I didnt was because I didnt want to make things awkward‎stream of consciousness‎0

‎This computer lab, Jester East, is rather warm. It's stuffy in here. That isn't however a bad thing, considering how sick I am. Actually, I'm feeling a whole lot better now, as opposed to this morning. I wonder if I missed out on anything important in Linguistics. I doubt I missed out on much. Oh well. I'm relieved about the calculator issue regarding chemistry. I'm glad I know someone who has a car (means of transportation other than the bus). If I keep shopping I may soon find myself in need of help from my parents, financially. Then again, I am buying necessities: food, soap, water, DayQuill, NightQuill, etc. My nose is cleared up. That's something to be happy about. Ah. I can't help but smile at the fact that he came over and simply spent time with me today. He basically just watched me sleep, sniffle, and cough. He's so sweet. I kind of don't want to go home this weekend because of him. He's gone out of town the last two weekends, and now I'm going out of town. Hmm. I don't leave until Friday night. I guess I should try to get a hold of my parents. They may be interested in my visit. Shoot! Only twelve minutes have passed. I feel like I've been typing for a much longer time period. Uhoh, my nose is causing me to sniffle. Ugh. it's so annoying. Good thing I brought Kleenex with me. My mouth is dry. And my tongue hurts from chewing gum. I'm not use to chewing gum, at least not as much as I have been lately. I'm self conscious about my breath, since I have a sore throat. As a result I'm constantly chewing on cinnamon flavored gum. In a way, this isn't exactly my train of thought, at least not the uninterrupted form. I find myself with the need to explain, or give a bit of background info to the reader, if there even is indeed a reader. Ah well. Just three more minutes to go. I can't wait to get back up to my cold room, pop open a can of ginger ale and chug. I've successfully made mouth feel even more dry. My throat is starting to hurt again, but only when I swallow. One more minute left. Perhaps I'll just type my abc's while I wait for that one minute to pass. Ooh. well aren't I little miss creative. Okay time's officially up!. ‎stream of consciousness‎0

‎better at a smaller school but I never really thought about those issues when I was selecting a college. I was too busy talking to or seeing my boyfriend or worrying about stupid high school bull that goes on everyday. I should have not cared where my best friend went to school, even though she was supposed to come here with me and then suddenly changed her mind without telling me. I am not resentful or anything but I feel that it is partly her fault, no it's not it is all my fault. I am the one who chose my future and now I want to change those plans. I guess I should be greatful that my roommate is not some freak with earrings and tattoos all over her body. I always think that things can always get worse and if you're lucky they sometimes get better. At least I did not get stuck in the same room as my suite mates because they are kind of snobbish. For instance, if I see them outside of our dorm then I have to say hi and if I don't they pretend they don't know me. I don't understand why people are like that but who am I to make a judgement, for all I know they are really sincere and nice people. I talk about people way too much but if you do it for so long it just comes natural and you can't stop. My room is actually really comfortable right now, usually it is either way hot or real cold.         ‎stream of consciousness‎0
‎"""I feel a bit stressed due to the fact that my first three tests are all next week. What will they be like?  Will I do well?  Or, will I enter the large classroom, with a crowd of students all cramming in the information for those last final moments before the test and freeze after spending countless hours preparing. The new environment is wonderful, however many changes come along with it. The first test of the year, the first test at college. Each exam seems to have much more bearing upon your grades than in the past. Some thoughts about how I'm going to go about studying have crossed my mind over the past few days. These hours have most likely been wasted, as I could have been studying or reading material which will be covered on my tests. However, this is not quite the way I always function. I often tend to spend too much time worrying about how I will go about doing something, rather than just doing it. Anyway, I spent a couple of hours studying today and I have figured out what time of each of my days between now and Wednesday, and how each precious moment will be spent. I'm sure it will all work out, but until these first three tests are finished, I know that some time will be spent worrying about how the final result turn out. Those are just some thoughts about school which are probably quite typical of a freshman. It's strange to come from the top, back down to a little freshman. It appears that quite a few people have decreased their level of maturity back down to a freshman in high school. A girl I know walked back into her room last night to find her pictures colored on and holes punched in her eyes. Seems a bit disturbing, doesn't it?  There's always the issue of talking to a boy and everyone assuming that your """"going steady. """"  It's difficult to even go to someone's room of the opposite sex without everyone assuming that you must have been doing something rather than talking. I guess everything, with time will pass. I'm really enjoying the transition, for the most part. It's strange to not see some of my best friends, but this is all part of growing up (Not to sound hokey). So far, it's been lots of fun and a time of many changes. I'm eager to see what lies in the future and continue to make new friends.   """‎stream of consciousness‎0

‎   In doing this writing assignment I was unsure of what i would be writing. I am having a pretty good day and I hope that it continues to be good. Transfering to UT this semester has been a great eye opener. This is my first time to live by myself and be away from home. There seems to be so much pressure right now with school and bills. It is hard sometimes to be alone, but I was the one that begged my parents to get me an apartment to myself. I wish sometimes that I would have lived with roommates, so that I would be more familiar with the people and things around me. I like having my own space and freedom, and I'm sure I can adjust the the loneliness. I have been feeling the depression kick in during the last 2 weeks. It is hard, and my phone bill is high, but I know that this is only the beginning of my life. My goal is to get my bachelor's degree in Accounting and then have a great job offer before graduating. Life seems like a blurr sometimes, even when you think you have it all planned out. I don't know what I really want from life besides being happy. I may be greedy, but I want to make a good amount of money, so that I will not have to worry about needs. I have a lot of pressure from my Dad. I have never felt like I can please him in what I do. This is probably why I have such high goals for myself. I've got to come to the realization that I don't need to make my Dad proud of me, but instead make myself proud of me. That is a hard thing to do. I am very critical of myself and if I don't do the very best, sometimes I feel like a failure. Hopefully someday I can feel pleased with myself and my life. I'm not sure what else to write. Well, I miss my friends back home a lot. My two best friends are both far away. I can't really go seem them on the weekends now because of my part-time job. But hopefully we will keep in touch regulary. Psychology is going to be lots of fun this semester. I love the way Mr. Pennebaker teaching. It's make the classroom environment much more relaxed and fun. I hope that I can also learn more about the emotional and physical behaviors that I possess. I often worried that I am crazy, jusk kidding. But there is a point where everyone has their own bit of craziness inside them. There are times that I feel like two different people. It happens very rarely, but I can see at times the difference between how I act and who I really am. It's scary, but I think normal. I sometimes feel like I am putting on a show for others to see and approve of. I have been told that I‎stream of consciousness‎0

I am glad school has started again, yet  I am worried how everything will turn out. I am angry with my step mother. A death in the family has made me depressed, and happy at the same time because I know that she is no longer hurting and is in a happier place. I am frustrated with growing out my hair. My dads and my relationship has grown since our talk last week. I am dissapointed in the way I acted a couple of days ago. I hope my dads and my relationship continues to grow and build.

Everything seems to come together all at once and fall a part soon afterwards. People never grow up, promises are never kept. Life goes on, right?  Learn to live with people. Learn to get along with those who don't attempt to get along with you. What have they sacrificed yet?  Does anything matter except themselves?  Sometimes you just need someone to talk to. To let understand where you're coming from. Does anyone see what's happening?  How long until everything's back to normal again?  How long until I can trust? What went wrong?  Somewhere, I lost the truth, reason, my smile, yet still I hurt and cry and need. I love this boy. But why is he the only one that provides comfort. It can't be healthy, can it?  How come no one else seems adequate anymore?  Life has to keep moving doesn't it?  But why do things work out this way. What happens in the future?  Where does all of this lead?  questions, questions, questions  I feel like everything is falling a part right in front of me.

Why do people always compare you to your friends can't you just be you, you don't have to have the same values as your friends, the same beliefs, or the same morals, yet people always seem to worry about you when it's one of your friends who screwed up. hate disgust disapproval attention  I need a hug, I just need to be held while I vent or cry, I need to cry to let everything out, but then I read that venting isn't proven to be healthy, but was it proven to be unhealthy?

‎Is Christina still on the phone? At 9:00 I can finish this and go to the grocery store. It's on. I wish I could have napster on Ethernet. I am really hungry. I wish I could have worked out more today. I should write what I'm talking about. I wish I could type with the right fingers. Why didn't I learn to do that? It was an important step I missed. I think the grocery store is on red river. I wish the door were shut. I wish somebody had emailed me today. Hopefully zac can help me with calculus. I can't remember anything. The teacher didn't even go over it with us. I'm really nervous about the quiz. Five hundred twenty five thousand six hundred minutes. Wow this really sucks. I have so much to do. It seems like I do nothing during the day. Maybe I should have stayed at the dance thing. Now I'm getting in the flow of typing. This split keyboard sucks for pecking. I wish I knew what to do about track. The phone is ringing. I miss my sister. I am glad I went to the grocery store last night. I hope dad doesn't get mad about the money I'm spending. I can kind of hear Saturday night live. I don't know how Christina concentrates in front of the TV. I had an itch in my nose. I can't wait until after my quiz. The hamburgers will be good at the KA house. I hope I have time to work out today. I think I will never be the size I want to be. Why do I have a rash on my ass? Its good I took a shower last night. I like my tri delt shirt. It seems like the time is passing very slowly. Only seven more minutes. Should I take a nap after this or study math or eat lunch? Ill ask Christina. Maybe she'll eat with me. I like the cafeteria food. I wish everybody treated the help better. Word perfect sucks. I hate the little green and red squigglies. There are worse things I could do. Somebody's knocking at the door. It's probably Elaine. No it's Bita. Is she talking to Greg? Is Christina going to be hungry? Man I hate those squiggly lines! I wonder if I should call the ticket office. I wonder if I'll need to study hard for this class. So far I've only done the pretesting and the writing. It's not even sunny still! That's awesome. I hate the heat. I can't wait until its fall. I love wearing jeans and sweat pants. I can run outside. Maybe then I'll get skinny. Mariah Carrey has a good voice? Where is she? Jessica Simpson sucks. She's ugly too. Her boyfriend is gay. Their relationship seems fake. My relationship is good. Jorde is great. I'm glad he's doing a frat. I hope they don't be hard on him. That is so gay that they do that to guys. I don't get it. Only two more minutes.‎stream of consciousness‎0

‎so , i am supposed to write what i think. thats sorat hard, because everytime you think a thought, it has disappeared by the time you have finished wirrint it. but at the moment i would like to talk about the one thing that is on lmy mind: my mother  yes, she is my mother, and yes, she is extremely overprotective. but i am in COLLEGE now . that is a wee different than high school in the sense that you have ot be. o whats the word. . independent   will do. yea you have to think for yourself, stand up for yourself, be yoursefl. except if your mother is preventing you from doing that, what are you supposed to do? if she doesnt let you come home later than whatever time she setss (which by the way is not very late at all) then you are basically in 9th grade again. do this, do that. and the worst part is, she never directly states what is on her mind. she starts out by asking questions. where were you all this time? i was worrying? why didnt you tell me?  i did ma. i don't remember  well thats too bad . i have to go tomorrow as well  where? when? till what time?  who what where when why and how, she might as well be a journalist. she instilled morals and values on me. doesnt she trust her own upbringing?  doesnt she trust me?  trust is anothe issue and overprotectiveness is another. or at least i think she is being overprotective. maybe to her indian standards she is extremely liberal. maybe. but this isnt india! this is the us, land of freedom. not that i'm going to go off and elope with some pierced stranger. i just want some privacy, some freedom. and most of all i want to move out. that in itself would solve so many problems. first of all, i wouldnt have to listen to her critisizing me one moment and loving methe next. she also would be liberated from my constant bickering and un called for interruptions. i wouldnt be too far away and yet not close enough to be distracted. everytime i try to study, she comes in every 15 to 20 mts. unless of course if she is taking a   nap   of 3 hours or so. but i feel guilty. i feel guilty for the way i am thinking. she deserves that nap, every second of it. if i worked as hard as she does, i would be half unconscious by now. but she finds time for a full time job, for being a single mother, for paying bills, for making food, for everything you would want a mother to do, as well as everything you wish she wouldnt do. she is the epitome of motherhood, in all its glory and grime. she has her pro's and cons, and i love her for that. but sometimes she can be a real pain.‎stream of consciousness‎0
‎Well, I figured I should write this right now while I have time. I am really busy lately. It kind of seems like I have no time for myself anymore. I am trying out for crew. There are a lot of people trying out though. I think like 130 people are going for 32 spots. I hope I make it though because I don't deal well with failure. I tried out for the soccer team and did not make it, but that was a little unfair because I did not know the work out to prepare for and everyone else did. So now everyone probably thinks I just wasn't good enough when that really was not the reason. I was just too exhausted after running to play with any skill. Oh well. I guess it taught me how to cope with failure. But it really hurts every time I fail. I tried to get into the business school and was denied. That got me so mad. There are all of these total morons in the business school. I know because I take classes with them and always make better grades than them. But alas, they can do what they want with their lives they entered right out of high school. Oh well. I am still going pre-law so it doesn't matter. Unfortunately my roommate and a lot of my friends are in it, so it is a constant reminder that I did not get in. But I think that all of this just makes me a stronger person. I am trying to be really involved this year. I am lifeguarding for the rec center. It is kind of fun, but I kind of dread going to work all the time. I just seem to have a lot of things on my plate. I had a fight with my boyfriend the other day. I am not sure if it was his fault or if I caused it because of all the stress I am under. Oh well. I think that things have really changed between me and my roommate too. Last year we used to be like best friends, but now things are different. She seems to be really distant. I am not sure what is wrong with her. Maybe it is my fault. I am not around as much as I used to be, so maybe she just wants more attention and is finding it elsewhere. She also has a boyfriend, so she spends a lot of time with him, which is fine with me. I just feel like things have totally changed. She went to a party last night and didn't invite me. Weird. I think I am really different from most people. I always seem to put everyone else's feelings before mine. I just don't understand why people don't do that. Or maybe I don't understand why I do that. Like, I would invite everyone to come with me if I was doing something cool. But all the people around me just I think are selfish. Maybe I just‎stream of consciousness‎0

‎getting tired and my mind is starting to sleep. My eyes are shutting too. Not good when I have 8 minutes and 16 seconds left. Oh well . I want to go eat now. I have a lot of homework tonight. I won't get to do anything fun, I won't ever get to do anything fun on the weekdays, I may have taken too many hours, but then again is college supposed to be asy???? No its not. ( I used that contraction again). . And I forgot the apostrophe, haha. Anyways college is supposed to be hard. So, I should probably enjoy working on homework 6 horus a day, catching up on the weekends while I do laundry, and then on the weekend nights I get time to play ping pong and be with other Dean's Scholars people and play intramural football with them. Speaking of which I played ultimate frisbee the other day. Err I mean yesterday. It was great, It was good to have some more physical activity in my life. I scare myself cause my abs. Well, where I should have abs at least. Still hurt from limbo three days ago. Also my legs hurt to. My roommate just said scrotum. I have no idea why. Scares me a little more . Just thought I would let you know that. He is nuts, I guess I should go back to what I was tlaking about earlier. Food. Haha, I wonder how many words I can type per minute, this would not be a good excercise to try out that theory though, cause if you take an averageit will be a lot lpwer cause I am getting very tired right now, that and I am not punctuating very well, and I am using contractions without the apostrophe's. My roommate just reminded me of George Carlin. Funny man!!! You should atch his stuff sometime, its hilarious. I am talking as if there is someone going to read this. Oh, only a minute and a half left. My eyes are starting to see some funky shiznit on this screen. Man, I am Hungry. !!!!! heh, I just looked at the time and it said 19 11, reminded me of 9:11, I see that all the time, or at least I used to on the alarm clock, or any clock for that matter, then I got hurt and it no longer showed up. ‎stream of consciousness‎0

‎Boy Bands  They suck big time. I'm listening to the radio right now and one of the 50 is on. I do not see the huge interest in them. They all seem fake since New Kids on the Block. They were the original hotties! I can't tell if it's my allergies or if I'm getting sick, but my nose has been running ever since this past weekend. I got to go see my niece and nephew this weekend. I really enjoyed that. For once I got to go out of town on Labor day. My parents always said next year, or later this year. I'm amazed we got out of Texas this year. We were supposed to go to Italy this summer, but that fell through. Then we were supposed to go to New York, and that didn't feel right. Then we all finally decided on Orlando. My brother was going to bring his girlfriend and we were all going to have a great weekend break from the routine. That didn't work either. We ended up cutting that one to. Finally we decided that it was our turn to go to California to see my nieces and nephews. It was fun, but they sure are weird. I have an older half brother, an older half sister, and an older halfhalf sister. We really aren't related, but we are still pretty close. We have a lot of fun together. I don't talk to my half sister anymore. She's a bit. Sorry. She's mean and selfish. She told me that I stole her dad from her. She has some serious problems. She has to be the center of attention, and she's always trying to be better than everyone else. If something good is happening between two people she has to stir things up. She's a complete brat. She's too used to getting everything her way. I hope my roommate can't see up my shorts. I don't know if this is something that happens with time, but I really don't like underwear anymore. I don't understand how some people can wear the granny kind of underwear. Sorry if I am offending you. But hey, this is my stream of consciousness. I'm really looking forward to this class. My mom had a lot of fun teaching it. I've always wanted to be like her in some way or another. I've always looked up to her. Somehow she is always right. There are the few occasions, but for the most part she's always right. Sometimes it makes me sick. I'm running out of things to talk about. Hmmm. I miss my friends from Wimberley. I'm a freshman. So many of my friends went to different schools or are still in high school. I was the oldest in my group of friends.

I don't have suspicions that I may have it, but I have had unprotected sex, and so I just want to be sure. Second, I need to stay focused on my school work, and having a boyfriend may distract me. Third, I just don't know if I can handle going through what I went through with my ex all over again. Not that it would necessarily happen again, but I just don't want to take the risk. Or maybe I should just be brave and take a risk. I need to do a lot of soul searching to come up with my decision. ‎stream of consciousness‎0
‎     The kitchen is so sterile and cold. I must say that this is a bit intimidating; writing your thoughts down on an electronic module for someone else to analyze and decide who you are. My mom keeps looking over at me. I can tell she wants to talk to me but I am avoiding her glare without trying to seem rude. It's really making me sad that I have to move back home from living on my own. I hate not having a space that is mine and I always feel like I am hurting someone's feelings with my disinterest in their daily lives. My dad calls like 5 times a day it seems whenever I am home and that creeps me out. I hope I don't end up like that. Very clingy. My feet hurt. I wish I could go change shirts because the kitchen is so cold and this tank top is not doing it for me but I am filling out this what-ever-you-call-it. I wonder what people make of me in general. Im sure their impression of me on paper is a bit different that in person. That makes me sad. I think I come off as more uptight than I actually am although I still seem like a hippy no matter how hard I try to suppress my bohemian leanings. My hair is so short I can feel the cold air on the back of my neck. It is so like my dad to keep the tempature of the house so friggin' cold during August that I want to dethaw in the heat. Susannah seems to have gotten along fine without me this last week and a half now that she has moved into the co-op.

He is so sweet. I can't believe he decided to drive all the way down from Colorado to come visit me. I miss him so bad and it hasnt even been a month yet. I feel like a hormonal boy, this is how much I miss him. Kissing is never the main part of our relationship definately but my body seems to be confused as to where he has gone. Where has he gone? I really don't see the good reason for him moving off to Colorado though and not even immediately starting college there. I know that whole band thing but I really think it has a lot to do with his family. Between those two huge families, god, that boy doesnt stand a chance as far as an independant existance.

‎"""College life is so much different than anything that I have ever experienced in my life. It is so neat how you come here knowing so few people, and by the third week you are best friends with a group of guys from some place you have never heard of. I would never have guessed that I would get a roommate that is engaged and is never here, or break up with my girlfriend, or even meet so many different people. What is so neat about it is that you meet somebody new every day. You meet those people, then you meet their friends, and then their friends, and before you know it you have this huge network of people that you thought you would never meet. The other thing about college that was different was the incredible urge within me to surround myself with people that I previously did not know. That is why I broke up with my girlfriend. I was being stubborn and was thinking to myself that there are so many women here and I will find somebody else. Sure there are plenty of other people here, but not one has been as cool as Monica was. Now I can't decide if I want to get back with her or if I want to stick it out and find someone different. When thinking about this decision, the saying, """"don't fix it if it ain't broke"""" always comes into my head. We were happy together and we had fun, so why should I not stay with her. Then again we did have our bad times and there are so many other people here at UT. I don't know what to do so I'll move to another topic. This semester I am taking 17 hours of course work. I have six different classes and everybody thought life was going to be so hard for me, but it really has not been to bad. You have so much time to get everything done in college. Where in high school I was playing 3 different sports and taking hard classes, now I am just taking those hard classes. It is nice to be able to do whatever I want when want. I am used to having my parents around nagging me about homework and studying, but they can only call and do that here. Just because I am not feeling to swamped with 17 hours doesn't mean that I want to continue taking that many hours from here on out though. After this semester I only have to take like 13 hours a semester, which will be even better. That is unless I decide to study abroad. By writing about exactly what I have been thinking about, I can now see what has been wearing on me since I have been here. I mean I knew what the basis was for all I was thinking about, but until now I hadn't really thought about how all this stuff has such an effect on me.

‎    Macintosh computer right now. I didn't particularly want to use one, but it was     available, so I took it. They aren't too bad I suppose. It would take a little getting     used to. And the keys are quite a bit more sticky than I am used to. And the fact     that the mouse has only one button it a little odd. But the thing that I find most     interesting is the fact that Microsoft Internet Explorer is on an iMac. I had always     wondered if Microsoft put out programs on Apple's. Quite interesting indeed. Now     I'm pushing the 9 minute mark. Looking back, this is quite a bit of stuff I have     written in the last nine minutes. All pretty meaningless though. I think I may just     stop looking at the clock for a while because it is a little depressing. You know the     feeling - staring at the clock makes time just crawl by. Quite annoying I must say. During swim practice we used to not like to look at the clock because it would     remind us of how much time we had left in practice. Especially with Coach Hutch. Man he was a killer. I think that was the hardest year that I ever had with     swimming. Funny thing is -- I didn't get a whole lot faster. I got faster with coach     Wilson -- as much as I hate to say it. OK I give -- I looked at the clock. Now I only     have nine minutes left to write. That's promising I guess. I wonder how the swim     team is doing now. With the girls and the guys separated and all. I wonder if the     girls like the new coach, and how the guys are dealing with Kyle again. The guy     behind me has more I'M's up than I have ever seen. He seriously must be talking     with at least ten people - probably more. The whole screen is flashing  and     lighting up all the time. Crazy. This whole Macintosh thing is kind of getting to me. I can't stand this keyboard. It is so sticky!  Every other word, I have to go back and     fix it because the key didn't register. I also keep going back because I keep     forgetting to add capital letters and such.

‎Hi, I have no idea what I'm going to write but who cares, here goes. I'm right now sitting in a small computer lab down in the base ment of Jester West, across the where I now reside, in Jester East, doing a writing assignment for Psychology on what comes in to my mind first. Well, my mind is filled with stuff that's definitely not very much to do with a psychological sense. I've been away from books and studying for 2 3/4 years now, and 1 week into UT and 5 classes and 16credit hours later, myhead is sent reeling from the amazing amount of work that I have to do right now. I've totally forgotten everything to do with math and calculus is being thrown onto me at an amazing speed and at an extreme difficulty for me to comprehend. Basically, travelling halfway round the world to get hit with books that send you into unconsciousness is definitely not the nicest feeling to have at the moment. And the books. i have never seen paper cost so much in my entire life! Damn, now I know why americans are so rich. Nah, it's all understandable to me, it's just the matter of settling down into a different environment, and making myself a new circle of friendsfrom scratch. Not much in my mind now but complaints and angst now I guess, but it'll be definitely back to my books right after I complete this assignment, and maybe the next. Thoughts, Ithink that's been settled for now. et's get on to feelings. Well I'm feeling hot and bothered right now because we just had a fire drill, I thihnk, I did'nt exactly see any fire and we were allowed back into the building, just a while ago and had a thousand annoyed beings buzzing around the side of the building trying to comprehend in our little minds what the heck is going on here, hwo's the joker who pulled the alarm or wave his stupid little lighter flame below the automatic sensor??Jerk!  Now, let's get on to sensations. Hmm, seems kinda wierd to me what this means. Sends the little runners in my itsy brain go wandering all over the place and the component called imagination into overdrive. Nah, no dirty thoughts here, it's an educational institution. that's what they all say anyway. Well, my senses are kinda dulled right now. A result of chatting last night with my roommate till 1am and waking u p this morning at 7. damn, really hate early mornings, I'm not a morning type of guy but apparently all my classes start way too early in the morning. Calculus at that, is that a classic example of stress or what. But what better way to start the ol thinker working everyday with symbols and numbers geting thrown at me and expecting me to understand what's going on?? Really don't know actually. don't really care. i guess that's it 20 minutes, mebbe a bit less. tata! ‎stream of consciousness‎0

‎This is the first time I have come to the library and when I first arrived here, I had no idea how to use the computers. First you have to wait in line and get on a waiting list. Then after that you finally get assigned a station to use. I wonder what the point of this assignment is. I think it's just another type of experiment to see what different people are thinking and what affects their thought. How much is someone supposed to write for twenty minutes? People who type fast can take ten minutes and write as much as someone who types slowly and has been writing for twenty minutes. Another feeling I have is that of being worried because I am doing this assignment at the last moment. After finishing it, I hope that I will get to class on time but I should because I still have a couple of hours before class starts. I am not sure what to write now. I have thoughts, but they are personal thoughts so I am not going to write them down. I need to start getting to my morning class on time. I've missed it a couple of times now even though all the material I have learned before but I do still need a review so I have to start trying to get there on time. It's strange typing this assignment because all through high school I always had to worry about grammar, sentence structure, and spelling on writing assignments. It feels like I am writing an e-mail to someone because I never worry about any English stuff on those. The only thing I am doing different is that I am capitalizing some of the words which I normally don't do when I write e-mails. I want this twenty minutes to pass by faster so I can move on to the next assignment. These type of assignments are fun because you can say whatever you want and don't have to worry about anything. I like this class so far. I have always wondered what different people are thinking and what their reactions would be they are in the same situations. Two more minutes and that will be twenty. I can't wait to go back to Houston to visit. I am partially homesick. There are certain things that I want to go back for and other things that I am glad that I left behind. ‎stream of consciousness‎0
‎"""I just sat down at a computer in the lobby of srd, which is where I live. I just finished checking my e-mail since my computer in my room has not yet been equipped with an Ethernet. My boyfriend e-mailed me because he just got home. He goes to Baylor. He hates it there, though, and wants to transfer here in the spring. I am perturbed by the method of typing this computer is set up with. why doesn't it automatically wrap to the beginning on the visible screen. sorry, I can be really anal at times. I am sorry if this looks messed up, but I couldn�t figure out how this works. sorry again. I sure am glad this isn't going to be graded, or else my body paragraph would get an """"f"""". I really miss my boyfriend. I am nervous about my dance-team tryout today. I don't know if I am in good enough shape to make the team. I haven't danced in like four months, and I am really out of shape. I am adjusting pretty good I guess to the whole college experience. I have made many new friends , and already have done things with them. for example, my friend heather and I are going shopping at the mall at 4 to get my boyfriend a birthday present. I am misspelling words right and left huh. I am kinda excited about learning psychology. the brain chapter, I hear, is confusing, but all of the case studies should be interesting  I have no more classes today, but I need to finish reading my chapter one in psych. and my chapter two in chemistry. My boyfriend cam for a visit this weekend. I think he had a good time. We went out to eat at El arroyos, which was rumored to have good Tex-Mex food. They were right, alright. some of the best I've ever tasted. we then went to comedy sports, an improv club at northcross mall. it was hysterical. the members of the teams respond to impromptu suggestions from the audience. He stayed with friends at towers and called me the minute he woke up on Saturday. he came over to srd and  we went shopping on the drag. I got two T-shirts, a baseball cap, and two books from the co-op. he got some u. t. memorabilia to take home with him to try and persuade his parents to let him come here in the spring. he is going to have a tough time explaining it to them, I think, because they will undoubtedly think that the only reason he wants to come here is because I�m here. I don't know how much weight that pulls in his decision, but I hope that isn't the basis for his decision. he started out at Baylor because they are said to have a good pre-med program, which is ultimately his goal. he met with the hpo office while he was here, and met with an advisor about the science program here. he was impressed that‎stream of consciousness‎0

‎know, because she is like my oldest sister, and she is probably the closest cousin that I may have. damn, I miss georgie. stupid punk with too much time on his hands and he knows it. procrastinator in the making just like me. I miss listening to my punk and ska with him, he was the only person that liked it as much as I did, and I didnt even force him to like it. funny now though, in austin one would say that its a bit """"trendy"""" to like this music, but in weslaco. its not really known. and even less played on the damn radio. speaking of radio, it sux. except for some stations in austin. and I don't know the call letters. I'm bad at remembering things. I guess that may be why I procrastinate. my dad has always told me that its impossible to forget things as quickly as I do, so I know he doesn't believe me when I say """"I don't remember"""". but in fact, I really don't, and its not because I drink like every day or because I'm on a drug, because yes I do drink, but not in large quantities (binge drinking) like some people and I only do so on the weekends strictly never on school days, and I don't do drugs. speaking of drugs, I knew it was easy to get them at my hometown if u wanted them, but austin is like a haven for those who feel the urge to get away. already I have open invitations from people I've met and seen a few times to go and smoke out with them, and one guy who said he could get me any drug I wanted free for the first time. I can just brush these things aside because they don't interest me or anything, but I get some weird looks from other people nearby who can hear the conversation, but I don't let that bother me, because if they are going to judge me from what they hear and not by who I really am, they arent worth my time. my dad told me to never judge anyone by what is heard and said, and I never have. some of my best friends today were spoken bad of before I had ever met them. now we're as close as brothers in a sense. I love my friends, I don't really know what id do without them. my biggest fear doesn't seem to be what kind of future I have or if I will ever be successful, or if I will let my parents down (god forbid though), but my biggest fear is never seeing my friends again. but when I think about it, its the stupidist thing, because today, the world is smaller than ever, and anyone can be found with the click of a button. so I don't really know why I feel this way or anything, nothing traumatic has happened to make me feel this way, so I don't really have an explanation for this‎stream of consciousness‎0

‎I just woke up a little bit ago and decided to go ahead and get this done. I tried to sit down yesterday and do all my homework but when I got an offer to go shopping, I just couldn't resist. My boyfriend's sister was in town and every time I go to Houston, she is really sweet with me and takes me out so I couldn't just let her sit at the apartment. We went to the Arboretum and looked around. Honestly, I don't have any money to be spending right now so I didn't buy anything but as soon as my check comes in, there are a few things that I have in mind. This whole not working thing is really different for me. For the past 4 years I've always been working and able to by my own stuff. But now, my parents decided that school is more important and I should take 15 hours and just not work. So at first the idea sounded really great but the more time passes the more I realize it's not going to work out. My parents are giving me living money to go out to eat and to the movies and stuff but on top of that they pay for my apartment, all the bills, and school. There's no way I would ever ask for more money, the money that I need for my friends and sisters birthday, plus my boyfriends birthday and Christmas. Carlos' b-day is Dec. 12 which is not too far away from Christmas, so I wanted to sort of combine his presents. In January some of my best friends and I always go skiing and this year it's going to be a bunch of us with our boyfriends!! So I was going to pay for half of Carlos' skiing trip as his Christmas present. But now that my parents pay for everything for me, I can't ask them to send me on this trip plus another half of the cost for Carlos, I would just feel weird asking. So I plan to tomorrow afternoon, after I get done with class, to go and apply to a few places here around Far West. I really just want a few hours a week, something for a little extra money. Hopefully I could work in a coffee shop, that would be ideal. I thought about Starbucks which is literally 1 minute from my front door but what I'm afraid of is that they'll give me the early (like 5am) shift. There is now way I can handle that on a Friday or Saturday morning. So we'll see, hopefully I get something soon. Ok well now what do I write? I have 5 more minutes left. oh some good news. My dad called me last night and gave me the great news that he won Incubus tickets!! My dad is so amazing when it comes to wining things on the radio. He's won a car, trips to Cancun, London, Arizona, Seattle, New Mexico (all paid for trips of course), probably‎stream of consciousness‎0

‎Basically right now I am feeling a little bit stressed out. I have to go to this Fiesta tonight for my sorority and I think it will be really fun, but we have to dress up. I have no idea yet what I am going to wear. On top of all of that I have class pretty much all day today. My Freshmen Seminar is really interesting, but we stayed last week for the entire 3 hours and that is just kind of a long time to be hearing about libraries. For some reason I am also feeling kind of overwhelmed by school. I don't know if I am behind or if I will be prepared for the tests or what. I always thought that I would have so much more time in college because I wouldn't be at school for 9 hours a day, but for some reason I never seem to have enough time. And wow, right now I am really tired. I wanted to try to get to sleep kind of early last night so I could wake up early today and get some things done, but of course that didn't happen. I'm also pretty hungry so I need to decide on something to have for lunch. We really need to go to the grocery store because we don't really have any good food. I could go eat in the cafeteria, but for some reason I don't just love that food. I mean it's not really bad, but I just don't really like everything that they  have downstairs. I'm really glad that we have the kitchens in Towers because I like being able to make my own food. Now I'm back to worrying about what I am going to wear tonight. I should have thought about this a lot sooner. I tried to go get something yesterday, but I couldn't find anything. From now on I am going to get all of my costumes together much sooner. My problem is that everyone always goes to do all of that stuff in the afternoon and I always have class in the afternoon. Oh well though! I'm pretty excited about tonight, but I really just don't want to stay out too late. And then one of my friends from high school is coming in to town on Friday so I think that should be really fun. I'm excited to see her. I've been feeling randomly kind of homesick lately, but I am going home for a visit in like 2 weeks and I can't wait! Now I am seriously getting so hungry. As soon as I finish this I am going to make some lunch and I then I have to do some reading. Reading is really the only homework I have, but it is so time consuming and I feel like I always kind of put it off. I don't know why I feel like that because I am not really behind in my reading or anything. oh my, my alarm clock is going off and that is‎stream of consciousness‎0

‎wear sweatershirts and slippers all the time. I doubt anyone can do to much about it. It's only been ten minutes since I started this assignment. I feel like it's been the full twenty. Another thing I don't like about my floor here in Jester is the fighting over the washing machines. For awhile we only had one working washing machine for the entire floor. I'd have to do my laundry at like 4 in the morning just to get some of it done. Now we have three but they always seem to be busy, and no one comes to take out their clothes when they are finished washing. As if no one else needed the machines. I swear sometimes I think I'm never going to have clean clothes again. I bought more socks just in case I didn't get clean ones for a long time. Sadly, I've only been here two weeks in Austin and I've already been to the Highland mall three times. Each time I really have no idea why my friends and I went. Only one time did we have something that we had to get immediately. All it was a white shirt for a party. The traffic down here gets on my nerves. I think Austin has the worst highway system in the world. How could someone construct such an awful system?  Don't they see the danger they are putting all the drivers in. I think I've nearly gotten into like ten wrecks. It's crazy. It's so hard to get around. Just simply trying to get to a Walmart is a pain. Thankfully I don't have to go that often. Ever since I got to Austin I my nights and days have gotten a little thrown off. I sleep at such random hours sometimes. I'm suprised I'm not sick yet. With the cold room and the funky sleeping times. Oh well it's the price you pay to be at UT. I'm so scared that I'm not going to do well in my classes. I'm not the worlds greatest test taker. Since all of my classes are based on tests I'm worried. I concentrate and pay attention but I know that's not enough to make it. My study habits are bad too. I need to get some new ones really quick!   ‎stream of consciousness‎0
‎It started out kind of good because school hadn't started. All I had to worry about was relaxing, working out, and enjoying life. Now, another variable, school, has been injected into the equation. I realize that it is a necessary evil because without it, I can never advance in life. Hopefully, one day I can work only when I want to work. Until then I will try to make the best of my life and enjoy every day like it was my last. You know, I should start my mission statement right now. I have also been wanting to put together a compilation of my own philosophies so that I would have a road map to live my life. I wish it were that easy. Anyway, here I am revealing how my mind works. It is kind of like a release to me. I should do this more often.       Recently, I have been thinking a great deal about my own shortcomings. These include my limited ability to speak, my limited athletic ability, and my the fact that I am not as charming and smooth as I want to be. Part of me wants to admit these shortcomings and accept it. The other part of me says I should always keep a positive outlook and refuse to accept these traits. I am at a point in my life where I don't know if I can ever fully improve this. As much as I would like to, it seems that I have hit a plateau and maximized my potential. But I guess I have to keep hope.     Moving on to other subjects, I wonder if I will ever find a woman to spend  the rest of my life with. Relationships require so much work, more than I may be willing to put in. This bothers me because I don't want to be 60 years old and lonely. Sometimes I realize that having faults, emotions and feelings is part of the price I have to pay for being a human. ‎stream of consciousness‎0
‎why am I so stressed out is it school or is it what is going on in my life, I have no clue. Its probably becasue I'm a freshman or is it because I just don't know what I'm am doing in this school, it's too hard. I don't know how to work the computer system, I have tons of homework, and its all catching up to me at the same time, it's unreal. I'm so bogged down with work and I have so much stuff to do but I'm sitting here typing on my computer on something that I don't know will even get sent to you. My friends are talking to me while I'm trying to write this assignment, and I can't' make my mind focus on on certain thing at all, the music is too loud and I have people trying to talk to me over the internet. these blinking lights are pissing me off I wish these people would shut up and let me tend to my business at hand. I need to read, do my pre cal and I just don't have the time. I don't know how to do my physical science lab, and reading just takes too muck time. I have a date tonight,  I don't have time to take them out, but I have to or that wouldn't be nice, I'm going through rush and that takes up more time than anything. I can't' deal with this anymore. I'ts starting to drive me crazy , but hopefully soon I will get used to it.

‎"""All I want to do is sit on my couch and take a nap while sitting in front of the TV. I'm trying really hard to not procrastinate as much as last semester. I usually wait until the last minute to accomplish anything. This was assigned about two weeks ago and I'm just know doing it. I've had plenty of time to do it, but I find myself wanting to plop in front of the TV instead. I love being a couch potato. My mind wonders a lot and people tell me that I'm a daydreamer. Whoever reads this will probably agree that I can't keep my train of thought on one idea for more than two minutes. This weekend I have to go home and see my grandmother who is in ICU because she was in a car wreck. I really hate going to hospitals and seeing how sick everyone there is. It scares me to think of what might happen to me in the future. My mom told me that she probably won't even remember me. I can't decide whether or not to hang out with my friends when I go home this weekend. I know that I will and will not accomplish a lick of homework or reading, but I will still give it a whack and take my books home. I don't know why I even bother lugging them around when I know that they will sit in the corner of my room. My brother and I are not speaking and it's been about two weeks so I kind of miss him. I'm supposed to be in his wedding in November so we better start talking by then. I can't decide what I want to do tonight. I might try staying in for once but that is very unlikely. Even though there isn't really anything terribly exciting going on during the week I still manage to find anything to do but be at home. There actually isn't anything good on TV at 12:30 PM, but I sit in front of the TV anyway. Usually I keep asking myself why I'm watching this stupid show and wonder who in the hell actually thought that shows like """"Sister Sister"""" and """"the Smart Guy"""" were even remotely funny. Why do those shows even stay on?  I don't know a single person that watches or thinks that they are funny. """‎stream of consciousness‎0

‎in a Jane Austen novel. they're so warm. There's such a sense of how to act without ever having to think. I wish I didn't think. I try to keep myself so busy that I don't, but my mind won't be constrained. Its only controlled by the window, my looking glass sanctuary. Its solitude without loneliness. I feel the most lonely with lots of people. on the south mall at noon, walking to class. So many people with such well put together lives, purposeful strides and slender hips. I watch them. I am behind a tree. I wear long skirts to cover what I wish wasn't there, with my thick dark hair pulled back, tugging on my wrinkled shirt that won't ever stay into place. I am magic though, I have powers. I can be invisible. No one ever knows that I'm there. No one ever knows I'm at my window with its menagerie of colored lights. I don't know about anything anymore. I wish someone would just tell me what I'm supposed to do. that there was some fated order of things. That would be easy to accept, that is why we have religion. It gives you all the whys and leaves you only the what is. but for some of us that won't suffice. No doctrine will halt the whys of my mind, I will always wonder about it if not the things it claims. I'm confused and lonely and at my window. It doesn't make sense. But tomorrow I'll get up and I'll go to class. I'll say hi to all my friends and smile. The weird thing is I'll even enjoy it and be distracted so that I only focus on the what is. I'll watch TV and do homework, and probably even go to a club with the cute guy I can't ever date because he happens to be my untrustworthy boyfriends cousin. (yes there are so many problems). But then I'll go to bed. I'll lie and look out the pane that sensitizes me to my pain, and I'll think about all the whys of my life and how I'll probably never figure them out, just how to distract myself from them.

Today I went to class, well first I was supposed to wake up at 5:45 am but instead I pushed my snooze button one too many times and ended up sleeping until 6:45,my bus leaves at 7:00. So I missed my bus, the third time this school year, I just can't seem to get it together. But anyways I arrived to my class 25 minutes late, and since it was my third time late to this class it was slightly embarrassing, especially since the only two doors into the classroom are right where the teacher is teaching. So I slowly made my entrance and went and sat in the back of the class, and for once I didn't fall asleep! AMAZING! I then decided to do my chemistry homework that I thought was due today but its really not due till Thursday. So I wasted my time off doing homework that wasn't even due, not like I understood much of it anyways. Well so then I was out of school for the day! My boyfriend, John, doesn't get out of class until 1:15 and it was only 12:30 so I decided to go to Barnes and Nobles and finish reading an interesting book I had started a week ago. Its called """"A Boy Called It"""" its actually a very upsetting book because its about this boy who endured horrible child abuse for the better part of his childhood. His mother was basically insane. She played horrible games with him, like making him burn his own arm over the stove, making him eat his brother's dirty diaper, and starving him to death, not to mention beating him to a pulp everyday. And his family just stood by and watched him take it. What kind of father could watch his son be abused like that and not do anything? That just makes me sick. Well so anyways I almost finished the book when John called and picked me up so we could hang out. So we watched Hannibal. Oh what a creepy movie! The grossest part was when he took the scalp off one cop and scooped out some of his brain while he was still alive. AND THEN, fed it to him! It was pretty disgusting. So after that we just kind of hung around his house doing nothing, but I love the fact that I can just do nothing with him and not be bored. But oh the drama that our relationship has caused with our friends! I don't even want to get into it. HMMM I'm thinking about going downstairs and getting myself another cookie, I'm addicted! I'm a chocoholic! But seriously I need to start working out, or eating less or something because I'm feeling a little on the chunky side. Maybe tomorrow I will do that. Yea right, like I have the time. I'll just starve myself, naw those cookies are just too darn good! I'm so‎stream of consciousness‎0
‎There is a girl named amy who annoys me very much. We used to be very good friends until I found her true personality. Amy;s personality is hard to relate to which makes her hard to get along with. She only does things that help her or make her look better. For example, she will only become friends with people who benifit her or make her look cool. Amy requires shopping. She shops at least once a week. Her shopping habbits drive me insane. Amy cares so much about how she appears to other that it hides her true personality. She acts like the person she wants to be but will never become. Amy is a smart girl but that is not obvious in a conversation. She acts oblivious to the current events and common knowledge.  Being at college and having a girlfriend at home is a hard task to handle. Eventhough it is tough to do, it sounds a lot worse than it actually is. While I do not see my girlfriend half as much as I am used to, I can still call her everyday. While phone conversations are not physicall confromtations, they do help in easing the pain of not having her around all the time. By being apart for extended periods of time, when I do end up going home to visit, the benefits are rewarding. The time spent together then is more special than any other time I have spent with her before. Because we both know our time is limited, we seem closer during my home visits. It is some of the only times when we think on the same level. Both of our plans include us spending time together. Eventhough I would much rather be at home with her, I am glad we made the choice to stay together while I am at college. Next year I can only hope that she decides to attend UT. It would ease a difficult stage in our relationship. ‎stream of consciousness‎0

‎"""So, far college life has been pretty cool. I really enjoy the freedom. I think I have a big problem with authority though. I'm terrified of the first test in each class. Especially psychology. Those people are experts on how to mess with students' minds and how to ask questions in order to trick you. I really don't think that there is all that much adjustment to college life. Basically I do the same things I did at home, except now I have to do my own laundry. But the bad thing is that I don't get to cook. I love to cook. I'm also really good at it. Inventing my own recipe gives me such a thrill. My parents say that's why I'm good/like chemistry. That's another thing. I'm really worried that being an engineer will be really hard. This semester my classes are not all that bad, but I still have a long way to go. Everyone says that engineering is the hardest field to go into, especially chemical engineering. I don't really have that much confidence in myself, and basically I just want to pass with Cs. Although I'd do anything to graduate in the Cum Laude. School is really the only thing that I've been better than average in. I don't even think I really excel in that!  There just always seems to be many others that are better than me. For once in my life I want to win something or be the best at something. But, I'm rushing for the Theta Tau fraternity. It is a professional engineering co-ed fraternity. I met some of the members today. They seem to be REALLY AWESOME!  I'm nervous that they won't like me though. They seemed to be interested in me today though. More so than the other people who were there. My boyfriend, whom I love dearly, is pledging the Phi Psi fraternity. I don't approve at all. He spends most of his time with these guys. NOT ONCE has he invited me to go to their parties/outings. HE always comes back telling me how they can't wait to meet me, and how other guys' girlfriends can't wait to meet me. I can't believe that other guys bring their girlfriends, but he doesn't bring me. I know he loves me, but I still feel left out. Most of the time, the activities really are only for the guys though. But on Thursday night they're having the pledge line thing. It's a semi-formal party. He HAS to bring a date, and coincidentally this will be the first time that I meet these guys. I really don't like fraternities or sororities. I hate everything they stand for. But I like Theta Tau because they are not superficial or big partiers and they rally care about engineering and finding a job in that field. These other Greek groups are more concerned with drinking and members of the opposite sex and smoking and conforming to a specific type of person. I DETEST smoking.

‎You all are going to read this and say, Who the heck is this freak? The first day of the semester. I�m tired already. I want to change to world half the time and it�s not at all working. I hate people sometimes and I like them the next. How can people lie to you, straight to your face and still not have any trouble what so ever sleeping. Have we no morals at all? All I can think of as I return once again to the glorious UT campus is how everyone is just paying to party; paying to drink, dance and meet people. I want to learn, but I want to have fun too. I can�t believe that all anyone thinks about anymore is the same old same old; drugs-alcohol, sex and rock and roll okay so maybe it�s more R&B now a days. I must be warped. I want someone to tell me yeah it was a great weekend because I got to go here or there and I met with my friend so and so. Not Hey it was a great weekend, I got some chick to come back to my dorm and I got plastered. What is that? Am I the only one who thinks this way? I can�t be. It just can�t be that rare that I would be the only one who would want to do something besides drink and party 24/7. I must be jaded. Yes, I�m a junior. Yes I�ve been here a lot longer than half of these kids, fish, in our PSY class. But still, the campus is still a new place to me. Everyday is something new. I learn something new. I meet a new person. Something, anything. But something tangible. I�m not talking about some whim like bouncing from party to party. Being pseudo friends and all. I try to be genuine. I don�t lie to people. I�m friendly damn it. I used to like people. People made me this way. All the mean rotten people in this world who want to lie to my face, cheat me out of my rights or just blatantly go out of their way to be rude and downright spiteful. How rude is that? I can�t believe what our society has come to be. I can�t wait to start learning how some people think. What makes our brain tick. Why am I the way I am. Why  that mean lady who cut me off right on my way home is the way she is, like she didn�t see my blinker, that�s what that stupid little light is for. I didn�t pay extra to just have extra decorations on my car. As if. Then she honks at me, like I was in the wrong, she knows she was speeding up to close the gap. How rude! I want to know why they think this way. Is this like the beginning of all of this Armageddon story. Is that what the 21st century is bringing our way. Why are we all fighting.

It is tied to such strong memories and now especially because I have left many of the people I love. It is hard when I think about this person. I miss them so and my body aches when I think about not seeing them for such a long time. This is maybe one of the hardest parts about college: the fact of moving on and leading a new life with out the people you have loved for so many years. Maybe, but my time is up now, and the rest of my thoughts will only exist in my mind. ‎stream of consciousness‎0

This may not seem to be difficult, coming from an overall average of 3. 6 GPA at Texas A&M Univeristy, Corpus Christi. But then I was not on a Financial Aid Plan and I knew my parents would still pay for school even if my grades fell below a 3. 0 average. So I intend to persure my dreams with my mind focused and my thoughts secured on one thing, making an A in every class. Even though I know that it will be almost impossible in Calculus II, I am going to try my hardest and I want to make my parents happy. They have given my so much already. And to make myself happy, is to make my parents happy. I don't want to be the reason of my unhappiness. If I can't make myself happy, then who really can?  ‎stream of consciousness‎0

‎Well, I'm listening to music right now and just relaxing. I'm about to start studying for Chemistry and Psychology so I do have a bit of work to do tonight. In Chemistry I need to do the homework and also the work for the discussion session. I'm almost done with the psychology chapter I've been reading all week. It's the most interesting book I've been reading, followed by biology, then chemistry. All of it kind of ties in together though which helps out a lot. Today I met a lot of people from my freshman interest group, which is kind of nice because I haven't met many people due to me living in an apartment. My phone line finally came in today after a week of waiting so I'm just now able to get on the internet, which I've sorely missed. It was pretty tiring moving all of my roommates and my furniture to our apartment because we're on the third floor. I have enjoyed school a lot more than usual so far, probably because it is actually interesting compared to high school. I'm glad someone picked up my shift at the Outback tomorrow to give me more study time, and also it helps because my car is in the shop and it was going to be hard to leave psychology at 5 and be dressed and ready for work at 6, especially without a car. I want to do the pretesting for the psych labs but the net is giving me a broken link. Oh well, I guess I'll do it later and maybe it will be fixed. I just got everything in my apartment organized today. I bought some hanging folders for all of my handouts, which are really helping, and other various organizers. I kind of like this assignment, I'm doing work but it's over what I'm thinking at the time and let's me see my thoughts. It's kind of like a recap of the day, because that's mainly what's on my head. Hopefully tomorrow I'll wake up on time considering that this morning I woke up at 9:10 and had to high tail it to my chemistry class by 9:30. Oh well, it's been about 20 minutes so I'm going to go ahead and study now for my classes. It was fun. ‎stream of consciousness‎0

This is probably one of the strangest things I've ever had to do but that's why this class is so interesting  I'm so excited to major in it. I'm having a bad morning, because I slept late and now I feel that my whole day is ruined. It's so weird to be doing homework like this, I guess I'm just not used to this. I'm so glad this class is so different. I also love philosophy too. I really feel like sleeping right now, however my scholastic obligations are more important right now. This is such a pivotal moment in my life, as I embark on college life. Right now I'm actually very proud of myself for getting all of my studies taken care of, rather than succumbing to sleep, as every college student would like to do. I feel like my roommate is really impressed with me as I click away at this computer so concentrated and intent on this assignment. I'm having trouble concentrating because the phone keeps ringing, and Riana keeps talking on the phone. I get distracteed very easily, and am not good at concentrating while there are distractions about. Right now I'm getting irritated, because she is always on the phone with her boyfriend and I cannot concentrate. She's always with him, and I can't be with mine because he lives in college station, and I'm sad because were growing apart, and I can't stop it from happening, and I'd really like to. He's so perfect, but I'm beginning to think there's more out there, and that gives me a terrible feeling inside, because I love him so much, and he's my best friend in the world, and the last thing I want to do is hurt him, so I may just lay a passive role in the relationship until I can settle things in my mind. I feel so odd confiding in a perfect stranger like this, but then again no one may ever read this. I have so many confusions and distractions here. My friend is getting screwed over by a guy who keeps telling me he's in love with me. I loved this guy as a friend,  but I've lost so much respect for him, by the way he's playing games with my friend's head. I got my first speeding ticket yesterday, and surprisingly, the only thing I was upset about was the fact that I have to ruin a Saturday in defensive driving. This assignment wears you out-my fingers are aching. I'm really worried that when I finish this and press submit, it won't submit, because I accidentally pressed it before, and at the bottom of my computer screen it says done.

‎"""I'm just sitting here thinking while I wait for my clothes to clean. While sitting here I realize how much my life is different in Austin rather than two hundred and eighty miles away in Nederland. For example, I always had someone to do my laundry there and if I did it myself I never had to wait for a washing machine. The thing I miss most about Nederland is not having my friends around. Even though my best friend and my girlfriend are also attending U. T and both are staying in Jester I still miss my other friends a lot. I always thought when I came to Austin it was going to be so much fun, but now I realize there is a lot of work involved. Only a week has gone by since I got here and I already have so much to do. That is another thing I miss about home, the ability to do nothing if I so desire. Here """"doing nothing"""" is not an option. I feel that if I do nothing I will fall behind and just be wasting time. I miss the little things about home. Even though my girlfriend lives here I miss being able to go to each others house.

‎"""My roommate just had a sandwich from subway, and the smell is killing me. It's one of my favorite things to eat. He gets somewhat annoying, though. Right now he is playing a video game, and he is got the volume turned way up. I don't mind so much; it's just hard to get my thoughts straight. I hate the way milk leaves a sour taste in your mouth. I always end up having to chew some gum or brush my teeth again, but it is so good. Everything I am saying sounds really stupid. I guess that's how the mind works though. I've never actually had to plot out my exact thoughts. Most of them just kind of run through my head, with the important ones being the only truly pondered thoughts. He (my roommate) keeps talking to his game. It's getting old. The game is cool though; a bit violent but very addictive. It even gets a little scary at night some of the time. Nights are so weird here. It always feels a lot later than it is, or not late enough. I always end up forgetting to call home and my girlfriend because by the time I remember it's too late to be calling the east coast. I don't know where my relationship with her is going. We've been dating for almost four years. Maybe I should tell my roommate that the talking gets annoying. Would that offend him though?  I don't know. I don't know about a lot of things. And I just realized that I just used the word don't know. """"  The internet lingo is getting out of hand. I used to be online almost all day long. He is still talking. At least I can look forward to the game this weekend. For once I won't mind the noise. It's kind of exciting. My first Texas game. I am so bored. I really need to meet people. Being from out-of-state definitely has its downside. Everyone seems to know everybody here and that doesn't help me very much. It seems a little awkward to walk up to someone and introduce myself, but that's what I have to do or I'll be spending a lot of time in my dorm room. That, my friend, was a run off sentence, but I'm much too lazy to correct it right now. Stayed up too late last night because I don't have any classes today. I should really finish my homework after this, but I am way too lazy for that. There it goes. My roommate made me lose where I was going with that last thought. I'm kind of thirsty right now, I should get a bottle of water. The Austin water is gross. I'm definitely not feeling the fact that there are no agents in the water to clean it. We've been buying water left and right. We should really get a Brita filter. This game really is addicting. I just lost all train of thought watching it for a matter of 30 seconds.‎stream of consciousness‎0

‎I feel strange because I'm in a world of completely new things. I tell myself that is all the same from any other people or situation, and it is in a way because if I always look at myself from an aerial view I will only see myself as one of the others, that we are all masses of tissue. But this is difficult because I know that I am myself, in a sense, and that really, everything will happen to me and the only way I can interpret the stimuli is by the way it comes to me, pertains to me. I don't want to be selfish, in the other respect of that word, but by thinking about myself I know that I therefore am selfish. I was depressed for a few days because I did not want to let go of another person. It was so much bullshit that I just finally sat on the roof and sorted everything out, looking at the stars. I came to the conclusion that I didn't need that right now, and that I was only cheating myself by believing this. It is strange because I have such problems with that. I realized recently that I have not reached the belonging. stage of life. Or maybe I reached it by not even trying, when I was very small, but I think ever since school started in kindergarten, as far as I can remember school wise, so maybe I have recessed back under that level of substantial importance. I'm having trouble being myself because I know that I don't even know myself. I do in a sense, but I sometimes think that it is just what I want to tell myself I'm like, and that I try to make myself the person that I think other people will like to see. Then I think that has everything to do with the belonging. factor. I am ultimately working towards self actualization. But I'm trying to be realistic in thinking that it won't be until I'm older like in my thirties. But it doesn't have to be that way. I don't want to feel like I can't do something, but I think how young I am and I think that I'm still just a little kid, and that I will have to work on this a lot more. I don't want to accept myself so I don't let others accept me. Its so hard, and winding. but now I know what I have to do, I have to find what it is that will make me chill out and respect myself and others. This is the key to passing the belonging stage of the cycle towards self actualization. I just need to stop worrying about shit like this and just be happy. And now I know what I have to do. ‎stream of consciousness‎0
‎"""I am feeling rather comfortable right now, much more comfortable than in the previous days. I don't know if I made the right decisin in coming here, I guess that's because people keep on asking me where I an from and when I say Hawaii they all ask me why I transfered and why I came here, as if Hawaii is so amazing and this place sucks. I guess Hawaii is pretty amazing in some ways. But it's not like my life was particularly great or exciting there. Added to that I don't like knowing everyone, well I like knowing people but I don't like it when you have no aninimity. I also am thinking a lot about girls, girls and sex, sex and girls, I guess that goes without saying. I feel like I have to step up my game and almost go out """"hunting"""" for them, but thats kind of weird to have that kind of attitude. It's not terrible romantic, but I'm getting pretty desperate. There are some hot hot girls here. I don't know what's my problem, It's probably because I live in Simkins which is on the other end of the earth. That's probably also just an excuse, because no matter where you are you still have to put some effort forward to meet women. Although it is a lot easier when your living with them. It's not so bad I've meet some women here, but the one that I am more serious with, I don't find myself attracted to at all. She's got a great personality, and she's female, which is a definite plus, but I really can't see myself commiting to her or having anything really serious. It's probably a partial ego problem,because of her relative homeliness. But I really do like to be surrounded by beauty, yeah right why did you move away from Hawaii. No I really like to beautiful things and have a real eye for asthetics. I need to be with a really attractive woman, fat chance of that happening with this face, and this nose, and no hair cut, and this voice and this low self-esteem.

‎I was just thinking about how different college is from high school. I haven't come home from going out every night until 2am and I think my roommate is getting really upset with me. I feel bad because she never goes out and when I tell her I'm going out I think she feels left out. I am going to start inviting her. We knew each other in high school and now we're living together which is kind of weird but it's working out really well. People always told me not to room with my friend because you will end up hating each other but it's been working so far. She is one of those motherly typesshe likes cleaning and looking after meit's fun. I just broke up with my boyfriend of 4 years last weekend. That was really tough because we were so close. He doesn't go to UT so that was making it really difficult. I miss him. I am dating this guy now that went to my high school but he graduated a year earlier. He's really cool and we get along but it isn't the same. We'll just see how it works out. I miss my family. I am so used to seeing them everyday and now that I don't it's weird. I was so ready to get out of the house but now that I am officially out it's sad. I feel so old. I have to be independent which stinks. When I first got here, my computer wasn't working so I had to take it to the repair place and I got it all set up by myselfit works nowobviously. That was kind of liberating, though. Doing something important by yourself. I was the kind of kid who never ordered by herself at the restaurant. I always had my mom do it. So, coming to college and figuring stuff out by myself is really weird. I haven't had much homework lately. I thought college was really tough and so far it really hasn't been. My roommate has tons of homework every night and I just haven't. I feel like I am missing out on the college experience. Today, I am going to College Station to visit my friend. We are going to see Pat Green in concert which will be totally awesome. I love Pat Green. My roommate is going to the Dave Matthews Concert in DallasI am jealous. she has been home every weekendthat's probably not healthy. Her boyfriend is still back home so she misses him a lot. I think she needs to stay here at least one weekend in between the times she goes home. I don't really think she is homesickjust bored. Austin is such a great citypeople always told me that once you go to Austin you won't want to leave. I can see how that can happen. There's always something to do.

‎haha. . Feeling the affects of sleep deprivation right now. . my eyes are feeling alittle heavy and the distant sound of a car alarm is making my mind drift. I see soft white cotton pillows floating around in the back of my mind with baby blue sheets. Man i need to get some sleep. I took this writing assignment as a challenge to be honest and type whatever came into my mind and i guess that this is what i am doing exactly to the   T  . Many different things keep up at night, school, my grandmother in the hospital, the different appointments that i have at school and the week coming up about 9/11. Wondering if my grandmother will be around then and if she is what state of mind will she be in. Which is wrong for me to say seeing as how she just had a stroke and part of her brain is not functioning. The doctors say that she does not feel a thing. I really would like to believe them. It seems unfair that she should live this long (92 years) only to be let to die a little every day. The doctors say that she has a strong heart for age. . well hell we have always known that. . but this one time i wish it was not so strong. . i miss her laughter and knowing that her mental capacity was just as strong as her heart. I miss her already even though i know that she is still with us. Bright red eraser. . why did they make them that color? why not white or blue or yellow on the end of pencils? It seems to me maybe it is the properties of how they make erasers that cause it to be the color that it is. Trying to stay with the typing and trying not to drift off. . i was hoping to get another experiment done after this one but i think that maybe i might try and sleep. I have got to get up earyl and get one of my vehicles registered down town. Maybe that is part of this writing experiment. Have us write this with the knowing that eventually we will turn it into something that we know or think that someone will read. So when we write we eventually get to that point of writing. The mind is laying out a thought process or maybe it is all just random and i am thinking out loud with my keystrokes. I read somewheres that in a thousand years the English language will be dead and that new ways are being created to keep individuals away from any toxic or harmful waste that might be around. So they are trying to create a visual sign for them that will be some kind of universal signal for danger or trouble or death.

Sorry mine won't be , but I can't think of anything!  Actually, I used to watch Nick at Nite all the time when I was a kid. I had this old black and white TV in my room and I would watch Dobi Gillis , Patty Duke and Get Smart. That one had to be my favorite, because Maxwell was so cool! They had the coolest little devices and ways to get KAOS . I really wish They still showed it on TV. The Nick at nite channel really sucks. all they show is Petticoat Junction and THAT girl. Not very interesting, if you ask me!  I am really not thinking of any thing to say right now. IOK I am trying to think of something.

Oh well I'm sure I'm not the only one. Now 14 minutes and 50 seconds have gone by. A few more to write whatever it is that I'm thinking. And I went blank again. Well I started to notice my back again, so I decided to sit up straight. I want to go do laps in the swimming pool. I used to be in swimming when I was little, I was pretty good. I remember that I had a swim meet on my birthday, and I wasn't too happy about that. I hated competition. I hated going to swimming classes, to brownies, jazz dance, and especially karate. Tennis too. Its weird how when ur little, you hate going to all of these things that ur parents make u go to, but when ur older, u whish u would have stuck with them. I was also in gymnastics, but I think I kinda liked that. I remember the first time I had a swimming lesson, I was afraid to get in a pool, so my mom pushed me in. I have class in like 10 minutes, but its in this same building and hey, for this class as a matter of fact. Pretty damn convenient right?  Well now I've taken care of this assignment, I still need to read like 2 chapters for this class and another one for eco. But I don't even know what we're supposed to read. People told me the first 2 chapters, so I guess that is it. Anyways I'm done. ‎stream of consciousness‎0
‎Right now I'm feeling a little stressed out and worn thin. I'm a real estate agent and a full time student as well. I've been to Round Rock this morning again for the second day in a row for a 9:30 appointment. I just can't seem to get everything done that needs to be done. I've got a ton of laundry to wash, my cell phone is ringing AGAIN, and tons of reading and studying to still do this week. I'm a little down because I had two deals at work fall through yesterday. I had to deal with another agent that was the most ignorant and unprofessional one I've had to deal with yet. His clients backed out of a deal on my listing and as a result I'm not closing on my client's new home. It's not a good time to be a real estate agent in Austin right now, but I'm trying my best and I guess that's all I can do. I'm not a traditional student and I feel a little out of the crowd in my classes. I've been working full time since I graduated over six years ago and going to school at night. I finally got to a point where I couldn't take any more night classes and here I am trying to finish up during the day. I've learned a lot and I value my experiences over the years. Sometimes I can't see the light at the end of the tunnel. It seems crazy I'm doing all this at once sometime, but bills have to be paid, I have to eat, and the cycle goes on. I do work hard, but I've almost forgotten how to relax and take it easy. I don't have time to watch TV and do a lot of things I really enjoy. I guess I'm more frustrated at the fact that there aren't more hours in the day than I am at myself for not accomplishing more. This is an odd assignment to do. I've never heard of something like this before. I am enjoying my classes even if I do feel like the outsider in most of them. I like to learn new things and have challenges I know I can get through and do well with. There are some nice people I've met at school, but most people I've noticed don't talk a lot and don't make eye contact when you pass by them. I haven't figured out why this is yet, but I'm curious. I'm friendly and smile and talk to people. It's strange they don't always respond. I was just brought up differently I guess. I'm not feeling really great right now. It's probably from stress, but I'm hoping it's just something in the air that will go away soon. I can't afford to be sick. It just won't work right now. My nose is all stuffed up and my throught is itchy, so I've been popping vitamin C's like they're going out of style. Let's see. . what else am I feeling? Well,‎stream of consciousness‎0

I've been caring a lot about my grades so far and I'm going to need to keep it up to get into law school at someplace like Georgetown or Columbia. I actually miss NYC a lot, but its a nice change down here and I'm happy to get out of Connecticut. I do miss my family a little, but I think they are doing fine and I'll be seeing them in no time. I'm glad my dad is going to be at the lacrosse tournament in Vegas come October. Still can't believe we lost in the state semi's to crappy Amity. That one kid was really good though. Maybe playing at UT will be just as fun and we'll have success. Seems like Texas lacrosse is nothing to ours, but I shouldn't get cocky yet. Its only a club team. Nobody better come in my room even though the door is open. Don't feel like being social, and its late. Its annoying that dumb Mark always locks it too every single time one of us is out of the room for five seconds. In fact, Mark is annoying in general. He seemed fine when we talked online prior to coming here, but he reminds me of Mendelson at home so much. I don't do well with these leech people too, I wish he wouldn't follow me around. But you know what, he is a really nice kid and I feel terrible saying these things, especially in some assignment that someone is reading. At least I'm nice to him in person. Waking up to him puking this morning was not cool either. ah he is awake, he better not get up here and read the screen like he always does. bah. Its funny coming to college after you're used to your friends at home. I'm glad that I don't know anyone and I'm on my own. You get to the point where you expect things of people and you know your friends so well, so coming here puts you out of your element for a bit.

‎I proud it arrived in 4 foot 3 inch thick box of plywood and screws and it now stands a proud computer desk with a cd holding section, god my eyes are starting to get tired but I really have no reason to go to bed b/c I have no classes before 12 and I�m not a morning person and I already have a hard enough time filling my days with things to do and I don't want to be too tired to party because I�ve risen before 10:00 am. so I have many incentives to not go to bed and I feel like shit if I get more than 8 hours of sleep I�m one of those always got to be busy people so I can't stand not having something to occupy my time even if it is sleeping late in the morning yet I feel like a slug if I sleep to late actually I feel guilty as if I�m wasting my life and not prioritizing my time correctly god my left eye is tired and my nose keeps itching, I�m so proud of myself that I am completing this assignment ahead of schedule at least it appears that I�m off to a good start see I just can't fathom how some girls I know are already missing class, I mean what the hell else do you have to do here but occasionally study, party, and sleep so my belief is you might as well go to class since your paying for it and it makes a tremendous difference in your grade, but I shouldn't necessarily jump on a soap box because I never know how long I will remain this disciplined. kick ass it's 12:18 and I�m signing off! ‎stream of consciousness‎0

‎I am so excited about being down at UT but now I realize what everyone meant when they said that it is hard to study at UT. I have been out every night this week because there is so much going on. Luckily, I have still kept up with my school work and have been to every class. This week is the only week that I am going to go out every night but I have just had so much fun. There is a guy that I met when I came down here my junior year in high school and we completely hit it off. I am looking forward to seeing him again. I absolutely love the classes that I am taking right now. It is refreshing to go to a class where the students and professors are excited to be there and excited to learn. The material has been interesting and I can't wait to get started in my business honors classes. I am having some roommate problems right now, though. One of my roommates is incredibly messy, stays out all night every night and gets very drunk. I need to talk to her about this problem before it gets too big so maybe I will take her to lunch this weekend. Saturday at the game I get to sit in a box and I am so excited. The last game was fun but it was at night and I was burning up so I can only imagine how an afternoon game would be. Thankfully I will be in air conditioned rooms with free food and drinks. I really like the guy I am going with. Not as a boyfriend but as a really good friend. He is a gentleman and really looks out for me. Last night I met this really cute guy and he kissed me but I found out this morning that he has a serious girlfriend that goes to TCU- what a jerk! I am very mad that he put me in this awkward position. I thought he was so nice and such a gentleman last night but that just goes to show you. You really can not trust freshmen guys- they are only after one thing. I am still getting adjusted to college life and it does take some adjusting. I really do miss my mom and my house. The food at Hardin House is so gross and I hate to eat it. I know that I am going to gain the freshman fifteen. This year is my sisters debutante season and when I go home I am going to have to go to tons of parties and everyone is going to notice that I ahve gained weight and they will all be looking for it. But I have been working out everyday and trying to watch what I eat but there is always candy and good food sitting out around the rooms and I always end up grabbing a handful. But, life is short. Right now I am going to finish this writing and‎stream of consciousness‎0

I hope we get home from Waco on time. I'm excited to go to Waco. It will be so much fun and Steve will make my birthday really nice. Although he is trying too hard. That is a turnoff. But he is such a sweet guy that I could never do anything to hurt him. He has really low self-esteem. And he is quite inexperienced. He is so much better than any of the other guys I have dated--but I don�t know if I like him. I like jerk guys I guess. Really good-looking cocky guys. Like Mark. and Jeremy. and Linsey. I wonder why Lindsey never liked me. I wish he would have. Even though he is a player, I bet I could change him. Yeah right. Wishful thinking. He is the best looking guy I have ever dated. Even though it was a short fling. It was worth it. He is so good-looking. Why does Steve put up with a jerk like him for a best friend?  I have no clue. Poor Steve--I think he lives in Lindsey's shadow most of the4 time. That really sucks. I'm glad I don't do that. I can't wait for the weekend--It will be awesome. And I also can't wait for the 20 minutes to be up so I can finish this stupid assignment. My hands are getting tired. I should add that to my list of aches and pains form my aerobics class.

‎ How necessary is sleep? The past few days, I have been going to morning swim practice and then my 8 A. M. classes. Is only four to five hours enough? I know that there are plenty of other students that are also recieving either this amount or even less. But is the amount of sleep affecting them to a certain degree, or can a person simply get use to it. Right now I am feeling somewhat tired, but know that I have enough homework to get done to stay awake and complete. Will all of this suddenly crash down on me, or will I get use to this kind of sleep cycle.      Also I wonder if I am organized enough to do well in most of my classes, not just to barely. Are my notes as good as they should be or should I be taking more during class? I write down most of the important or interesting points that the professor comments on, but do I need more details in order to do well.      The past few days I have recieved two different parking tickets, that I thought were unnecessary. I double checked all of the signs in the area, and even asked the front desk of my dorm, concerning that location. The signs indicated that I wasn't parked illegally, and the front desk said that it was perfectly alright to park there, if I could find a spot. But after two different parking tickets from the exact same spot, I guess I now have to pick a different location. I wonder though if the tickets will be able to be dismissed because of the lack of indication for this site. I wrote a couple of e-mails to try and appeal both tickets, but have recieved no word back. The front desk said that the people in that department would only drop one of the tickets, if either. This is mainly because of the lack of evidence that I have, which I think is incredibly stupid.    ‎stream of consciousness‎0

‎I have never had an asignment like this before. It is hot in my dorm room. I always feel sweaty especially at night. It is difficult to sleep. Now that we are a few weeks in to school I can feel my self getting more and more stressed out every day. The workload is quit large, and I never have enough time to do everything i need to do. Actually right now I am between classes but i only have and hour to do this assignment, do some calculus, and eat lunch. I know I won't do one of those three. I probably won't eat lunch. Even though I am starving. i went to today and got a wristband for the OU game. The draw for tickets is tommorrow morning so i guess i am going to miss class to stand in line. If i do that and don't get a ticket i will not be happy. I wander where my girlfiend is right now i havnt seen her at all today. We live in the same building and I still rarely see her. Usually only at night, and even then we study so we don't talk much. I miss all the time we spent together when we still lived at home. We both went greek so between her sorority my fraternity and school there is maybe 30 min a day left for just talking to each other. Hopefully things will get easier later on in the semester. I live at Dobie so i have three roommates, and one of them is trying to teach himself the guitar. I am really sick of hearing his stupid guitar. Plus he sucks at it. i just accidentally pushed the back button on my computer, and when i pushed forward what i had already typed was still here but the timer started over. I wonder if that matters. I don't have time to keep tying for another twenty minutes. I am serously considering not going to my next class. I just want to eat lunch and take a nap. I just realized something funny my next class is pyschology. Oh well just because i am doing the assignment doesn't mean i have the energy to go to class. Who am i kidding i am to worried about missing something important so i will go even though i am really tired. During the last lecture i fell asleep for about 10 minutes and woke up really confused. I have so much work i have to get done before friday. Which wouldn't be that big of a problem but my fraternity has something going on every night this week, and since i am a pledge i am expected to be there. My time is just about up so i am going to stop typing now. ‎stream of consciousness‎0

I can't believe someone cut and pasted a dvd manual in this one time; it's such an easy assignment. God my hips are huge. I have lost weight since I came here, all this walking around. But I want to lose a little more. I wish I had Katie's body. She is so gorgeous! Even more so than Jenny, and Jenny is one of the most beautiful people I know. But I am not all bad myself, I have my moments certainly. My jaw hurts again; I've been holding it too tensely because I am so stressed out I was perfectly fine until my mom called. well I'm almost finished, just a few minutes left. I wish I had a new phone. I hope that photo of my friends at banquet from last year doesn't fade; the light is right over it but I guess I have the negatives if I want another print. That reminds me, I haven't done photography in a long time.

‎"""Stream of conscience. Just typing whatever comes to mind. I just woke up a little while ago from an exhausting week of this thing called college. I have made many friends, but still looking for that awesome bond, my best friend Brook and I shared. I am from out of state, so meeting people is a must for me. I meet someone new everyday; it's like a mind game that I play with myself. Can I remember his/her name? What crazy way did I try and remember his/ her name? I do want to go back home this weekend. All my friends that went out of state and those who stayed instate are going back home for Labor Day weekend. When I was small I used to spend this weekend up at our little lake cabin with my grandparents and my dad. My dad would drive up/down from wherever he was on business to take my sister and I up to the lake, for one last weekend full of sunshine and sunscreen. The word Sunscreen reminds me of the beach, Florida trips with my mom and stepdad and of course my wonderful little sister. I remember Cara and I would play Uno in the back seat of the pickup all 12 hours to Destin. Goodness writing from my conscience brings back a lot of memories. I am growing up, that's what everyone says anyway when you go off to school. Here I am its hard to believe that I am fully responsible for all of my actions, I have nightmares about not waking up in time for class or dreaming of scary situations with my friends and family from back home. A couple of """"nightmares"""" I have had have truly disturbed me even after I awoke. So bad that I had to call back to Arkansas to make sure everyone was okay. Even though I new it was a dream, something inside me made me make sure. Random change of pace, but I am hungry. My favorite thing to eat in the morning is a cinnamon roll, but since I way slept through breakfast this Saturday afternoon, I will have to adjust my system to something much more healthy. My abs hurt when I laugh, they are a constant reminder of my wonderful workout last night. While most everyone was out boozing it up down on 6th street, my friend and I worked out. Seems a little ironic. A little bit of me wonders if I am truly missing anything, just the social aspect of college. I just feel that its okay to do whatever I want, and if I don't feel like getting ready to go out. I shouldn't bother with it, another part of me wonders how can I say no when I never have. I am only seventeen so I use that as an excuse until I turn eighteen at the end of the month, to decide if I want to go out or not. I bought my first football tickets yesterday, the lines weren't all that bad.‎stream of consciousness‎0

I step ouside and inhale, a cold rush of life crystalizing in my lungs. This is where I realsize that everyday is but a breath. That single inhale was a day, was a life. Old postcards line my smile. I am a story, and I tear up when I thumb through my dusty file cabnet of experiences. My eyes desperately search for ideas, while I know they are all within some governing organ I possess. Heart or head, it doesn't matter. but I find it odd that my eyes do the searching. My little fan is growling at me. It's probably upset that I always leave it on. Let me turn it off really quick. Ok. Done. I heard a door shut. The people in my dorm are an infestation. I cannot STAND them. I try so hard to see the good within everyone, but how can I if they are all the same. Everyday I walk around the autumn grasping campus and I look. Look at people, the sky, the earth, the buildings. but the people. I LOOK at the people. They make me laugh! We are so strange. I see people trying to avoid the world as they bounce down the gravel paths with an iPod pumping sound into their skulls. People who try to look sexy. People who look mad at the world, and sneer at you, the person mearly trying to understand some fraction on their existance and importance. People look at me too. What is it that I possess that makes their eyes flick up for even an instance to make contact with mine. My heart races when they do that. It's kind of a love. I love them for that one milisecond. I understand them for one lapse of time. But did they look at me because I was looking toward them? Am I attractive to them? Am I mysterious? Scary? Sexy? Sometimes people LOOK at me. That's my job. I absolutely hate being in here. Trapped between machine and the cement walls around me. I cannot stand the fact that our society is ruled by technology and media. I don't watch TV, I don't keep up with any news, I listen to music and read books. entertainment is all I need on media terms. We should kill our TV's though. As one of my favorite bands says """"I wish the world was flat like the old days"""". I have to say: Amen. We need to evolve backwards! We need to get back to the old way of life, religion, and appreciate the earth and sky, appreciate our unique existence in the universe. We need to notice our equality before we notice the differences. But, I suppose it's just wishfull thinking. """‎stream of consciousness‎0

‎"""I begin by wondering exactly what purpose this assignment serves. I also wonder what will pass as the year goes on. Caffeine. I suddenly have a craving for caffeine. I would get up and grab a Dr. Pepper, but that would interrupt my writing process. What would it be like to be known as Dr. Steve?  Do I really intend to go through with getting my doctorate?  And if so, what happens afterwards?  It boggles the mind to think of the ways in which I may change over the next several years. Wow, I certainly am typing fast. On my old computer, there would have been a delay between the time I pushed the keys and when they appeared on the screen. I very much like this new flatscreen, it certainly goes well with my new system. Every computer I build has some odd quirk to it that no other system demonstrates. It may be my fondness for ATI video cards, or it could be my personality reflecting in the way that I put these things together. All in all, the system works well, but there are times when I just want to drop-kick it out the window. That, however would involve opening the blinds, which would expose me to the eye-squinting sunlight. I have always rather disliked the direct sunlight, partly because it is directly associated with heat. I can stand heat when it causes immediate, measurable pain, such as the burning of a hot pan handle. However, the discomfort of extended exposure to the hot, sticky, mind-numbing Texas sun can drive me insane!  There is a point after which I do not care, but sometimes it seems as if that point never comes. Time is certainly a subjective concept to the human brain. The saying Time flies when you're having fun"""" is absolutely true in this respect. If only it were the other way around: uncomfortable situations seem shorter, and the pleasant experiences extended. Alas, that is merely wishful thinking. My roommate's girlfriend just called three times within a 15-minute period. Ah, there he is. """"The ol' ball and chain just called"""", says I. What an interesting concept this telephone is. From pretty much anywhere in the world, you can have instant contact with anyone else that has a similar device. Of course, there is a slight delay due to the limits of the speed of light, but as long as you are on Earth, this is a relatively slight matter. Last week, I spent time with my family looking at Mars in my dad's telescope. Mars will not be closer for next to 250 years, and it hasn't been this close in nearly 60,000 years. From what I have read and heard, though, it has been within a few hundred miles of this distance in the last several years. Calling last week an especially special occasion is barely the truth. The difference is like standing in Manhattan, walking 10 steps towards New Jersey, and saying that it looks closer. One-hundred odd miles in over‎stream of consciousness‎0

I hope the twenty minutes that I am required to write for pass by in a hurry, because I have yet to finish some of my Economics homework that is due in class today. I have yet to discern whether my Economics professor is adequate in his teachings. On several occasions, he has veered off the lecture topic and has attempted to entertain the class with anecdotes and personal experiences that possess no ties to the world of economics. On the other hand, my Calculus II teacher is not my favorite, because he moves very quickly through sections of the book and speaks very poor English. I am not quite sure where exactly he is from but his accent makes it difficult to understand his lectures. Aside from these two exceptions, my professors appear after two weeks to be very adept in their teaching methods and are very entertaining and informative to listen to. I am tired of talking about school, because it seems like that is the only thing I came to Austin for. On many occasions so far I have gone out on nights that I wouldn't normally party on and have had a blast on good old Sixth Street. I think it helps a lot that a bunch of my friends from high school decided on the University of Texas as their college of choice, because it has given me people to hang out with until I am able to meet and feel comfortable with a new group of friends. I have yet to pick out a girl worth going after, even though there are thousands of gorgeous and available women, because I have yet to give up my feelings for an old friend of mine from high school who decided to pursue a tennis scholarship at Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tennessee, much to my dismay. I frequently talk to her via email and telephone, but we both feel that a long distance relationship would not be the best thing for us at the moment. However, I find it hard to stop thinking about her, because she is exactly what every guy desires in a woman. She is blonde, just shorter than me, has a perfect figure, is very athletic, intelligent, and her father has a lot of money, which is always a plus. The only downfall which she possesses is that she can be clumsy at times. In fact, yesterday she spilled silver nitrate down her shirt in Chemistry Lab, thus causing her to have to us the emergency shower in the back room. To‎stream of consciousness‎0

‎Well, here we go 20 minutes of writing. I've been so stressed out today. I had to find my friend Jacob a date for Lion Hunt that is in 3 weeks. It was so hard because he lives back home and no one knows him  Thank goodness thid girl that lives in my dorm said thath she would go. I have a ton of pre cal homework to do ajnd I have no idea how to do it. I 'm hoping taht this will help me get rid of sone stress. I went to go look for a cell phone today and all the deals are pretty crappy. My shoulders really hurt this chair is probably too low and this is a lap top and I don't like typing on it because the key board is in the middle so your arms don't bend. Oh well there wouldn't have been enough room in here for a big computer. This room is so small. I feel do cramped and like I don't have any privacy ecept now because my roomate is not here right now. Our room is so dirty and I am so sick of it I just want everything to get cleaned up. But of course we don't have enough room. Well, I don't know what elsse to write. I have an 8 o clock class in the morning  That sucks. I have to get up way early in the morning. Carey, my roomate, doesn't have class until 11 o colock in the morning. I can't forget to turn in money for my dues to the sorority house. I have a meeting tomorrow so hopefully I will remember. That'll be another item off my chest. I am so lost in anthroplogy. I wish I could understand. I've also got a speech to write and rehearse on thursday so I can give it on friday. that makes me nervous because there is only 1 other freshman in my class, but its not like you can really tell the difference that much so maybe everybody that knows will havbe forgotten that I am a fish. It sounds so weird that I am  a freshman again. I'm having fun though. Austin is way different than wichita Falls. I went home lastr weekend and the KA party was so much more lame than the parties we have here. I 'm glad that I still am not at home like 75% of my friends are. I can't wait for tommy and jacob to come down . They'll be here in 3 weeks. YEA!  I sure am getting tired of typing and personally I annot wait for these 20 minutes be over because I need to do my precal amd then go to bed I have an early, long day ahead of me . Mondays and Wednesdays are the longest days for me. I basically am in class formn 8-5. Well, Its been 20 minutes now time for me tog og and finish all my fun stuff. ‎stream of consciousness‎0

‎     I guess  I will talk about the guy I was dating before I came here, since I just got off the phone with him before I got on the computer to complete this assignment. After dating him for two months I realized relationships differ greatly from person to person. There are no straight rules to follow. Everyone makes up there own rules when they date someone by what is right for them. At first I was so confused by this guy  because he did not call me on a regular bases or he didn't schedule dates like other guys did. After just talking to him now has made me realized he didn't do this to be a jerk but it is who he is, because he only called me when he had something to say to me. Right now he is dating another girl but he doesn't call her and she doesn't call him. I think that is weird. I guess I will have to learn that relationships will give me experience to meet all sorts of people and how to deal with them. I still talk to this guy everyday and we are friends but I am getting to know him better than when we dated because now we are forced to rely solely on talking and no physical contact. I had lunch with this guy earlier who trying to make the long distace relationship thing work. I was thinking I could never do that. I think it would be hard to trust someone that much or not have physical contact. Because I believe that seeing someone and spending time with them is a big part of a relationship, so that is why the guy and I are not together. I thinkI'm still new to the dating thing because I don't understand it. I try not to play games, but sometimes its hard not to if the other person is. I have mostly dated older people. My first real boyfriend was seven years older than I. That relationship was not a good idea he was at a different point in his life than I was. His majurity level was that of an eighteen year old boy, that was why it lasted as long as it did. I think sometimes people stick together because they fear that there won't be somebody else in the future to fill that person's spot. After breaking up with him I felt I needed a boyfriend and I even felt a little lonely. Now I am fine and mostly dated for fun I guess you could say but my parents thought it was stupid. I gained a lot of experience this summer and have learned what characteristics of others I find attractive or of high standing and what I don't want my future husband to have one day. Not to say I am definitly marrying someone but I hope I will find that right someone. For right now though I am going to stick to being a loner because‎stream of consciousness‎0

‎The one thing that I miss here at school is my drums. I couldn't bring them with me to college because there is no where to put them. I used to play in a band and people used to tell me that I was really good but then I stopped playing and I got worse. When they were always there for me to play I never wanted to but now I wish I could play them more than anything. My best friend is a drummer but he always kept on practicing and he got really good. So good that now he is moving to Maryland to join a band. The band he is joining is pretty successful death metal band and they have two albums. I miss my friend and I hope that he is doing alright up there. He left all of his friends and family back in San Antonio and he doesn't know anyone in Maryland except for his band members and he really doesn't know them too well. I wish I could go up and see him and watch his band play since I am a big fan of death metal music. I listen to all types of music but death metal is definitely one of my favorites. I don't like it when people talk bad about death metal when they don't even know anything about it. I want death metal artists to be able to someday get rich off there music like all of the other pop artists. Because the talent that comes along with death metal music is remarkable.  ‎stream of consciousness‎0

‎When I first heard about our first writing assignment, I figured it would be very difficult because I am used to writing about a specified subject matter. But hopefully I can take up these 20 minutes by talking my day or how I feel. Actually, I think I'd like to start out by expressing my thoughts about the pre-testing we were required to do. It was amazing at how some of the questions completely reflected me or something that I might feel or think. I also learned a little about myself, my self-esteem, and my self-confidence. Well, I don't have much of either (self-esteem/ self-confidence). Hopefully, by living by myself and taking care of things here in Austin I will develop these traits. When I first came to college, it was very terrifying because all my life my family and friends have always been with me and even taken care of things for. I almost had no experience about 'living on my own' and 'taking care of myself. ' I mean, I knew how to do my laundry and the essentials, but when it came to asking others questions or figuring stuff on my own, I was not able to do it. For example, I hadn't even ordered pizza by myself! So I naturally hesitated to call up the pizza guy because I wasn't sure of what sizes or deals they had. But I quickly learned here, that YOU have to take initiative and most importantly, no question is stupid. In fact, the question I probably ask, someone else might benefit from it. So I think I have grown a great deal in that aspect while here in college. In addition, I would always do everything with my friends. And upon coming to Austin, I feel/felt very lonely because all my close friends have gone to other colleges. Usually, I'm not very extroverted and won't 'go out of my way' to find a friend. So these past few weeks, I did not let myself do that. I very bravely went up to random people and made pretty good friends with them. This was very rewarding, in that, I don't feel as lost in such a big university, and I'm greatly improving my interpersonal skills. This is a characteristic which I will need for my expected major. I'm still not too keen on what exactly I want to do because when I think about it, I want to do/be everything, but when I think about it again I don't want to do a single think, and be totally carefree! But I think I'll try to keep up my original enthusiasm. I'm thinking about business or communications--at least it's narrowed down THAT much. But I still keep changing my mind in these two subjects. I don't know if I should blindly follow my dad's advice or at least try to see what interests me. Because architecture originally interested me, but my dad would know better and told me not to do that. So I'm really confused about that. Hopefully, I will learn more‎stream of consciousness‎0

‎a few weeks, maybe it's the water, or could it have come from my roommate who has a cold? But my stomach hurts, too. Is it the dorm food that is causing it? Is it the heat outside that is so unbearable? I wonder if it is from stomach acidity or stress? Nowadays I cannot tell if my bad health occurs from stress or from real factors. Will I ever find a cure to keep myself healthy at all times? Is there any way to be rid of stress? There are so many questions, but probably only one right answer. Who knows that answer? When will I find out? When will these 20 minutes be up? I wonder what other people are writing about. What do you think about through another person's eyes? I think I should stop asking questions and start explaining more about my thoughts and feelings  but aren't my questions an explanation in itself? I think its interesting that psychology covers biology, because wouldn't that mean there is something permanent about your personality in your brain? The question of nature vs. nurture has always interested me. I've always wondered if its both part nature and part nurture that influences the way we think. Does anyone think as much as me? ‎stream of consciousness‎0

I wish my mom would call so I could tell her that not only  did I get the package with my Windows 95 disk but I also received my Nabisco  care package. It had all kinds of goodies in it but I haven't yet gotten to eat  any of them yet. I wonder where Scott is. I haven't heard from him since Monday I think. He's probably at work, or playing Magic with Tim and Anthony. I'm glad  I got a card from Julie today, looks like she's having a good time at OU. Maybe  I'll call her before I go to the Red River Shoot-Out in Dallas, or better yet maybe she's got a place to stay in Dallas and I could stay with her. I wish the guys  working outside would be quiet. And for once the girls in my hall are quiet, either that or they aren't there. My fingers are really cold , but they aren't numb yet so I guess I'll live. I'm so excited! I get to  go to my first UT football game on Saturday. But I also get to go to all of the other home football games because I got Season tickets. maybe I'll see my Aggie friends at the A&M game November, Kristine doesn't have an e-mail address yet otherwise I�d write her. I  don't think I get to go home again until September the twentieth, but maybe I'll get to see Scott then, unless he comes here, but I don't think that he'll do that because it will end up costing him to much money, then again it will cost me a lot of money too, if I keep going back and forth I hope that I�m getting enough sleep to make it all the way through the day. I need to start planning my week like I  learned how at the time Management and Study Strategies Seminar I went to on Sunday I think I need to take a nap.

‎"""In the eighteen years of my life I've realized that man is either born without a conscience or with one. I was born with one. In my heart I bleed at the injustices of the world, of the rights taken from humans because they had not the power. What is more distressing comes not from the fact that the injustice is so evident but because of the powerlessness of the victim. I believe that education can free a man. An educated society becomes more aware. It can offer self-esteem, knowledge, influence, and the voice to speak out. It has become my belief that I or anyone else who is willing can make a difference. The conscience in me longs to make a difference. To scream at the top of my lungs, """"This is wrong! You are wrong! Give back his rights! Give back what does not belong to you!"""" but I know in the bottom of my heart that humans, no matter how hard they may try will never rid the earth of its total harshness, because some men were born with feeling and some without. This gives no excuse for not trying to make a change for the better because with every change, an initiation must begin. Though my eyes see the sorrow of the world, I am a person who strives to look for the positive in people. My first encounter with an individual has me searching and finding his good qualities. More likely I am opt to say something good about a person rather than bad. Within me I feel no intimidation toward others strengths and I take pleasure in finding and praising someone else's gifts. Determination is the driving force of my soul. Being perceptive of other's nature has allowed me to see that it takes more than intelligence to reach a goal. I know only if I want it can be done and within my veins is a spirit that keeps me aiming to reach the top. It seems forever that I have expected highly of myself. With every aspect of my life I feel a certain pull to be the best I can be. Rarely do I accept being less. My love of knowledge and natural curiosity arrives from my need to grasp my world to better understand it. I cannot accept just reading new knowledge. It is utterly important for me to comprehend it as well. This allows me to know the unknown, to conquer all the earth's secrets for I do not like being put in the dark. I must see all things with my eyes, my heart, and my brain. This gives me confidence and strength. Hopefully, I will conquer all my fears, build my character, and use it to make a difference in the world. """‎stream of consciousness‎0

‎"""At my high school I graduated with a class of 23, and most of my classes were comprised of 5 to 10 students. Sitting in an auditorium with over 400 other students is hard to get used to. I try to sit close up to the front of the class so I don't see all of the hundreds of students behind me; I think it helps. All in all, I think  I am going to enjoy """"college life"""". However, all of this studying is going to take some getting used to. I don't think I have read so much of textbooks my whole life. Also, I find the e-mail thing a little confusing. I didn't have e-mail at my school, and I wasn't online at my home computer so I am not up to date on all the terminology. I know I shouldn't be, but I am kind of ashamed to ask for help just to send an e-mail message. I am under the impression that most people who come into these libraries know just what to do, even though I am sure some people are even more in the dark about the whole online thing than I am. ( I hope! ) Lately, I find computers really frusterating. I am trying to get into the pretesting page for Psych. class, and this computer keeps telling me that the user is down. I have already completed part of the Pretesting survey, and I clicked done after each section so I hope it saved my work. Every day after my classes, I feel like I have a million things to do before the next morning, and sometimes I realize I get too stressed out over nothing. I'm learning to slow down and take everything one step at a time, instead of trying to do everything at once. I have also learned that if I write things down I will remember to do them, and I won't get stressed out worrying if I have forgotten to do a certain assignment. Although I was a little worried after the first day of classes, I don't think college will be so bad as long as I keep up with my homework like I plan and don't procrastinate like I became so accustomed to in high school. I like it that my classes are somewhat spreadout as far as class times go. This gives me time to experiment with the computer, and try to get some homework done. I hope after my next class, the city has the water fixed at my apartment. Last night really sucked because a water main broke and we were left without water, they cut off the water without even telling us. My roommates and I had to drive to Taco Bell last night just so we could use the bathroom and brush our teeth before bed. And for this morning we had to use our bottled water to brush our teeth. I never thought about how helpful water is until we didn't have any. """‎stream of consciousness‎0

‎K. , now I'm writing, but I'm actually kind of confused about what to do. I never really had an assignment such as this one. I feel no pressure since its for a completion grade, so I guess I feel some what good right now. I feel excited about school because I finally finished my schedule and its not going to be so bad after all. I guess my hopes are kind of high right now. I was also excited about your class since I nearly did not get in. At first, the class was closed and so I gave up until I peaked on my roommates computer to see that there was an opening in your class, but it closed again right after I added your class. I also feel kind of stressed because I'm looking for a job at the moment to pay all of my bills and my rent this year. On top of all of this I am now taking more hours this semester than I have ever had, so I guess I have my work cut out for me this year. I am also anxious about finishing this assignment now, I feel compelled to look at the clock and check to see if I have now surpass the 20 minute mark or not. Nope, still got quite a bite of time left. So, lets see what else I feel. I also feel somewhat lonely because I had to leave my family and friends at home. Even though I have two roommates, they are kind of kept at a distance. My goal this year is to try to succeed at a job, if hired, get a 4. 0, not party as much, and meet more people. I like meeting people, they are all so different and its funny to see likenesses in some. I found that you can also find people that remind you of others you used to know and you automatically share the same felling of like or dislike for that person because of the reminder. Confusion and hopefulness is what fills most of me at this point. So, I hope that's ok. Part of the confusion I feel is because of this class. I went to the pre-testing section to fill out the form to receive the free hour but the connection was bad or something like that, so now I had to finish assignment one now and do the test afterward if I'm allowed by the computer.

‎"""What a strange assignment. Why did the typing start indented? Twenty minutes seems like a long time and the timer does not make anything go any faster. It's weird that the one thing you look forward to all day turns out to suck. What do wounded ducks look like? Alright, 1% complete with this assignment. Physics is really hard, but I actually understand everything fairly well. I suppose that's a plus. I wish Lindsay would talk to me. I really miss her companionship. I suppose now is where you notice that I am a normal college kid going through the feelings and emotions. I really hate to be normal. I am not somebody who is outrageous to be not normal because that is conforming to another standard. I instead just do what works for me and disregard most everybody else. I really miss Lindsay. I wish I knew what to do to get he back. I think that is the problem, you can't get someone back, you can only hope they come back. I really hope the power doesn't go off in the middle of this assignment (knock on wood). It's been going out recently. Alright, almost 25% complete. Maybe I shouldn't track my progress. Is anybody really going to read this? Is this simply an experiment? Maybe it's a wpm counter like in computer class. Here comes the scary part in the music. I am listening to Firebird Suite. It really is a neat song, but it lacks something, not sure what but something. What if you started this assignment at 4:50 on Friday? That would really be horrible, but it wouldn't be quite as bad as starting it at 4:41. That would actually be ironically funny. Good times. Something is odd. Not sure what, but something seems a bit strange. I want some natural light, I really can't stand these fluorescent lights. These buildings also are disturbing. I didn't live in the country, but I really miss the trees I had around my house. Living amongst these lonely trees is strange. It's like they are put on display as something that used to be. I want to go to a school that is in the trees. I am talking a tree house. In the trees of the Amazon. That would be a sweet experience. The window, right. Haha, of course I open my window and see construction. Great, just great. It's rather depressing. Alright, more than 50% complete. This could really be a dangerous thing if you really tapped into your thoughts. Might find something you don't want to find. Hmm. I hat that feeling of being hungry after you've just ate. Is ate the right word there? I think it might be eaten"""", who knows. I feel like I have something to do, but I really don't know what it is. It felt really good to sleep in this morning.

‎     Ok, here I go. I wonder what most people are thinking of when they are writing this. Probably all kinds of things. Well, I have a girlfriend, her name is Lauren, and today is our 10 month aniversary. I'm excited but I'm sad that I don't get to see her that much because she is still in high school. She goes to Clark in San Antonio just like I did. That's where we met. We were both on the cross country team. I'm kind of tired. I wish I didn't have to spend all my time reading the Iliad. It's getting really boring and I don't even think it's a very good book. They just like it because it's old. Like last night I spent several hours reading it and I still had to do more before I went to class today. Man, it's only been 5 minutes, I don't think I can actually think for a whole 20. I wonder what I would be doing if I wasn't doing this right now. Probably doing calculus homework or reading, heaven-for-bid, the Iliad. I can't wait until the weekend when I can relax some more. At least I only have one class tomorrow and it's really easy. It's calculus and this is my third year in a row of taking it for I shouldn't have any trouble with it. Unfortunately though it's all stuff I've already learned so it's boring also. Let's see, that makes two boring classes now. How about ancient Rome and BA101, those are also boring classes, but at least I like Rome so at times that class can be interesting. So that leaves psychology, that's definitely the best class I'm taking, because it's really interesting. Especially because many of the things don't have answers so it's just what you think. I'm probably biased towards it though, because I've always been a math and science fan. Math was ruined by one teacher I had, but I still love science. Hopefully, I can use the business skills I learn to start or work for something like a bioengineering company, that would be cool. Psychology is also fun because I know a few people in there. One of the guys in there I went to pre-school and kindergarten with and haven't really seen him since. Monday I met this girl named Jessica. She's pretty nice so I have someone to talk to before class. Bjorn just got home, I wonder where he's been. He probably was at class, I wonder which one. He really likes Cake and he just turned them on. I can tell when he's in his room usually because there is music on. He also likes the Beatles. I don't really like the Beatles but Cake is cool. I wonder who just got on AIM. I guess it was Rory because he just IMed me. I wonder what he wants. Maybe I'll have to tell him to go away, but I probably won't, because I'm not that kind of person.

‎"""Today I bought the new Omoide Hatoba CD. Pure noise and noise art are very interesting forms of music. Sometimes there are lyrics to these songs. Most of the time they are just phrases being repeated, or just screams. Some bands have gone so far as to create their own languages. This type of music bypasses your brain and hits you straight in the gut. Words are a very limiting way of expressing how this music makes you feel. I need to remember to go to the video store tomorrow and rent """"purple rain. """"  Prince is very talented as a musician and actor. I would love top see him in concert.

This is a strange assignment, it makes me wonder what other people will write, and who will read this. Will anyone read this?  What if someone writes something truly """"offensive""""  It's not their fault. One cannot be responsible for their words when they free write. Can you imagine if there was an assignment where the teacher tells the students, """"Ignore all social constraints and act freely for the next 20 minutes""""?  That would be pretty wild. In my everyday speech I often swear. By not swearing in this am I limiting myself. But how far can one free write?  How much can you open yourself up until its just words thrown together?  Grammar is not important to this, yet I assume you expect some common grammar to hold this together. Am I not free writing now?  I would like to go on tour with a professional wrestling league and write about their tragic lives. Professional wrestlers mutate their bodies with steroids to the point where they no longer seem human. They destroy their bodies and on occasion fight in steel cages. I wonder if they ever look in the mirror and ask themselves, """"what have I done?""""  """"I'm not even human anymore""""  Their job is to fake fight. The world of celebrities is quite interesting. I wonder if their is an equation that could make someone famous. I could use the scientific method. My hypothesis could be  """"If one writes a song on the piano (Elton John style) about celebrity after they die, it will be a success. """"  I could have started this when Versace died and continued it when Diana died. Of course this would not sum it all up,  but after numerous studies, I feel I could ultimately find a mathematical secret to success in the entertainment field. """‎stream of consciousness‎0

‎This is probably the weirdest writing assignment I have ever had to do. Usually we are always told almost exactly what to write, but I like the idea of doing this a lot more. I'm not too sure what you guys actually do with this things, but that's fine with me, because I'd much rather me doing this than writing some boring long paper. Today is a Friday, the second best day of the week. Thursday is the best, because my classes end at 12:30 and I only have one class on Fridays, so my weekend pretty much starts on Thursdays. College life is so much better than high school life. I love having all the freedom. The only part I would change is having someone making sure I get up in the morning for all my classes, I seem to be having problems with that, but I don't think it will happen anymore. I joined a fraternity, so I think that is helping making college more fun. Usually when most people think fraternity, they imagine the typical fraternity and everything that goes along with it, mainly the hazing. I joined Lambda Chi Alpha, and it is a national policy of theirs not to haze, so I have nothing to worry about. I've heard stories about other fraternities hazing already, and I don't understand what the point of it is. Completely stupid! Why would you want to put people through the different kinds of suffering if you're going to live with them for the next 4 years? Yes, I understand that it can build strong bonds between each pledge class, but it just means you are always going to hate the class above you that hazed you. Being in Lambda Chi is incredibly awesome, I can't imagine me ever having any regrets. By joining my freshman year, it makes me feel more comfortable at UT than I think I would have been if I had not joined. I no longer think of myself as just another random person, or number, at UT, because I know belong to something. I'm just kind of rambling on here, not really being able to think of much to say. I'm wondering if these are going to be used as examples of things in class, or if they have some other purpose we are unaware of. I think I'll talk more about me, because I'm such a great topic(hint of sarcasm there). I feel incredibly comfortable with my life. I think I am extremely at ease in most situations, and I think I have a good grip on life. I've moved around a lot, so I think that has helped me. I was born in Scotland and lived there for two years, then I lived in England for seven years, then California for three years, then New Jersey for a year, then I moved back to the same city in California and lived there for almost five years, then three days before the start of my junior year in high school I moved to Texas, where‎stream of consciousness‎0

‎     For some reason, I have been feeling really tired lately. I have been getting plenty of sleep, but it's been hard falling asleep. It feels like there have been a million random thoughts running through my head recently. I haven't been able to understand many of them, or why I think them in the first place. Sometimes, I feel like I have ADD. Ever since I stopped smoking marijuana, my grades haven't been what I expect of myself and my motivation just has not been there for anything. My mom persistently assures me that I don't have it, but I just want to get tested so I know. Before I moved off to college, I couldn't stand being at my house for more than an hour at a time. But now, I want to be there all the time, even though I can't. I know that many kids feel   depressed   right after they move off to college, but I don't feel like anyone is going through what I am. I never understand myself. One minute I miss my ex-girlfriend. I was the one that broke up with her, but why do I miss her so much?  I went home last weekend, an I ran into her. Right after I left, I understood why I broke up with her, but I am already back to thinking why I broke up with her. I don't always understand her either. Sometimes I feel that it's her clinical depression that makes her that way, but other times I feel like it was always me. I remember hearing the phrase, there's someone for everyone. Well if that's true, who's my someone?  I hate waiting around and I just want someone that I can count on being there. I guess that's why I decided to break up with her in the first place. I never felt that I could count on her always being there for me. My dad told me that my grandfather was an alcoholic, so does that mean that there is a good chance that I will be one too?  I wish things were the way they were before last summer, when I had a girlfriend and had my friends that were there for me. I understand that college is all about experiencing new things and meeting new people, but I really haven't had the urge to do either of the two. Maybe this is just a   phase   that everyone goes through. I hope so. I have had no will to meet any new girls, which I expected the complete opposite before leaving. If I miss my home and my parents so much, then why do I never have the will to call them and just talk?  Why can I not just gain a little weight? No matter how much I eat, I can't gain a pound. I know these are supposed to be the best 4 years of my life, so when do I start counting?‎stream of consciousness‎0

I can't decide if I want to major in neurobiology or switch to liberal arts and look into psychology. I think this is a really interesting field but at the same time I feel like its uhhh I lost my train of thought. lets see.

I suppose that after a few weeks of real practice, assuming I make the team, I'll be able to decide when to work my legs, and how hard. Some of the guys there seemed to have been working out, or playing football in high school, because they were pretty used to running body-circuits, and jogging, and weren't too beat at the end of the day. Some of the other guys were obviously novices in the world of fitness. A few people vomited, one guy passed out, and I heard talk about a guy who was trying the rowing workout a few days ago who fell flat on his face and started convulsing. I'm not sure exactly what was going on there, but I'm glad nothing like that has happened to me yet. I can't wait for it to get cold outside, so I can actually stand in that boathouse without wanting to collapse. It was so hot and stuffy in there today that going outside in the 80 degree weather felt like walking into a refrigerator. Once it gets colder, I'm sure I'll have to buy a sweatshirt, and some warmer gym shorts, but the cold will be much more welcome than the hot sticky boathouse. It'll be a lot colder if I fall in the water too, but I'm hoping that won't happen too often. """‎stream of consciousness‎0

‎peculiarly interesting thing. I wish I had written more as a kid. I wish I had kept a journal. I did for a while. it's amazing to see you misspell simple words, write so stiffly that the page seems like stone. but still, it's you. it's how you were long ago and how you have changed to what you are now. one excerpt of time. what piece of time. on paper. people talk of time machines, yet we all know they are physically impossible. the closest we will ever get is a little journal and the words that describe what the pen felt from the emotions of the heart. but back to time. I can never stay on one subject in my mind for very long. perhaps that's why I find it hard to sit still for long amounts of time and read. I wish I had more time. I wish I could make everyone happy. I think I could if I had the time. I'm trying to finish my reading. but my friend wants to go out. hell, it's 11:30 at night, and I wanted to get up at a decent time tomorrow. I never get anything done it seems when I start my day at three in the afternoon. but he wants to go out. I guess I should; it's saturday night. but hell, I went out every night this week it seems. why should I go out this night as well just because it's saturday. I should stay and work. I guess it's good though that he asked me to go out and I said yes. if I hadn't of been waiting for him, then I wouldn't have thought right now of the fact that I need to finish this writing assignment.  argh!  I can't stand not to proofread things. I'm such a perfectionist. I had to make sure that word was spelled right. I can't allow myself to not proofread something. even though it seems that's part of the point of this assignment -- to not look back and simply type. that's near impossible for grammar nuts, it's a sin. but I guess I will force myself to hit that submit button in about one minute when my twenty minutes are up. crap!  that sentence ended on a preposition. again, these things just can't happen with my writing. but I will rebel; I will leave it be. I will just accept things for what they are and move on. (another preposition)  perhaps I should act my life out that way. just let things be, accept them as they are, go with the flow, man. maybe if I didn't worry so much things would be much easier. I stopped worrying about the music and it didn't bother me until I thought about it again. I guess I should relax in life. I guess I should go out and have fun and forget about staying in and getting caught up on my work. I guess I shouldn't proofread this. I guess I should just hit‎stream of consciousness‎0

‎I feel very tired and alone. My room is too quiet to sleep, if that is possible and I don't have anyone to talk to since my roomate is out of town. The fan is on high right now to try to create some noise and keep me cool and comfortable, but the mugginess and isolation are too much to allow me to get any meaningful rest. It seems as though me clothes are permanently stuck to my chest and back. There is hardly any noise in my room besides the sound of the fan and the typing sound of my keyboard. I like to type as fast as possible so that the keys make almost a musical harmony. Besides the occasional loneliness, I am very happy with my new life here at college. My ex-girlfriend from high school came in for the weekend to see me, and I had a great time. however, I don't think that I would like for her to come to college with me. She goes to A&M and although I don't get to see her as much as I would like, I think that I saw her too much when we were together. It makes for sort of an awkward situation, but I have a lot of freedom, and at the same time, quite a bit of security knowing that she still cares about me and loves me. I don't like to say goodbye to her, though. She holds me and kisses me all weekend, but when it is time to go, she gets more depressed than she was when she hadn't seen me for weeks. Sometimes I get scared about her being so home-sick. She stopped eating for a while, but only told me about it today. It made me upset to think of someone who was too upset about college to eat. Everyone ends up saying college is the best time of their life, so I think that people should just forget about being homesick and try to get to the fun stuff as soon as possible. I like to have my own place, my own stuff, and a new group of friends. For the first time in my life, I can use self-control and discipline which I lacked back in high school. Back then, I figured that my parents could try to catch me if they could, but here, it's either be smart or lose out on a great opportunity to get an education and make connections. My parents do still have some say in my behavior though. They are the ones that tote most of the bills for me and recently rejected my request to join a fraternity. I was really excited to get my bid and go through the pledge stuff, knowing all along that my parents would make me wait out the first semester until joining. I wanted to make some new friends outside of the ten or so good friends that came here from high school with me. Oh well, I guess that parents know best, and I‎stream of consciousness‎0

‎"""Palms are sweaty, my stomach is uneasy, and my head just feels in pain. I'm sick, I'm not supposed to get sick. I'm pre-med"""" I'm supposed to be taking good care, promoting health. I need to get better, it is essential that I get better. I need to concentrate on my studies. I sleep late because I cannot fall asleep due to late night fevers. I may not be feeling well, but my conscience follows me as well. Did I break up with Joseph for the right reasons?  Of course I did, he was over possessive, or maybe I just didn't understand him enough. Maybe, I didn't love him enough to understand. Did I love him at all?  Yes, I'm certain of it. He needed to understand that I needed to be trusted and understood. Three years, three years of my short life, all gone to waste. I feel incomplete. maybe I should go back with him, no I must resist. I know what I want, I cannot be defeated. I need to conquer what I have set out as my destiny. I need to be a doctor. I cannot be a failure. I need to find the cure. My sister is ill, my sister is laying on her death bed. My nephew, barely 2 yrs. old, he needs his mother. I need to work faster. I need to help her. I cannot let time defeat me. I need to find the cure, why does cancer have to be such a stubborn illness?! Does God, not understand, does he not know that my sister is the highlight of my life. If I could, if I were given the chance, I'd give my life for hers. I love her so much. I have two other sisters, but this one is my best friend. Who's going to be there for me. How come I'm not being there for her. I should have been there for her surgery, I was at school. Life sucks, yes it's proven. God is attempting to take my sister away, and at the same time he is trying to physically impair my father. You broke his legs. We are poor, I know it, but my parents are hard workers. My mother a housewife and my father a maintenance worker. They worker harder than most people who just take dimes as they come. Not even breaking a sweat, how dare you hurt my family. Do you plan on leaving me without family? Without love? I need to get better. I need to get rid of this sick. I need to keep on with my studies. I need to find the cure. I need to tend the needs of my family. I need to do this fast. I need to do something. What did I ever do you?  I donate to others. I help people. You don't help me. God, listen to me, I will not me defeated! I cannot be defeated. I cannot slow down. I need to achieve. Nobody in my family can ever be harmed.‎stream of consciousness‎0

I thought I was going to get away from all that, but I don't know. I don't know what to write anymore. I'm thinking to hard about this and I know I shouldn't be. I should just type whatever it is that I am thinking.      The time is almost up. It went by surprisingly fast and I kind of enjoyed doing it. It actually made me feel a little better and sorted things out for me. It's weird how writing can do that; Professor Pennebaker did mention that in my class. I guess it really is true. I feel like I should have an ending to this. But, I guess not. I guess your thoughts never really end. It kind of makes me nervous when I can't think of what to write. What does that mean?  It's kind of like when I blank out talking to people which I seem to do a lot. I'm kind of interested in how this experiment thing will turn out. I wonder what the point of it is. ‎stream of consciousness‎0

‎I really wish I didn't have to do this. Actually I don't want to do homework at all. I don't like reading textbooks and that is all we have been doing. I actually didn't even start reading any of my books until I knew I had to for an Economics quiz. This weekend the plan was to catch up on everything and I really didn't. I did catch up on economics, which is the hardest class I'm taking. I am really disappointed that I didn't get to see my friends in Arlington, but I did get to hang out with my parents and that was nice. I miss them but I love college and Austin. I also hope that I get to hang out with my cousin more and get to know her a lot better. Unfortunately our age difference is huge so we don't have too much in common but she has been calling and cooking for me so I don't mind that. Cat's here and she's talking. Jessica is here and she's messing with channels. Earlier we watched the U. S Open after she got home and we watched Justine Henin-Hardenne lose. Yay. Oh, I really have to sneeze and I'm kind of thirsty. I really want to eat some peanut butter and crackers and maybe a taco. One time our fridge was leaking stuff that looked like coke. Today I talked to Alicia's mom more that I talked to her. I actually didn't get to talk to her because her voicemail turned on. I hope she is doing ok at UNT because she hasn't sound happy or upbeat when I have talked to her. I talked to Amanda today too and now I'm so frazzled and distracted. Cat and Jessica are loud and I can't even complete a train of thought. It's kind of scary if a guy has a blow-dryer. Is William Faulkner the dean? I don't know but I'm so excited about UT. Jessica has a lot of clothes, food, and books and I think my dorm room is going to be vacuumed up by her stuff. Today I bought milk, actually my mom bought milk, and then we drove to Kinsolving. Later, I tried to put a fitted sheet onto my bed and it took a long time to put on and Jess made fun of me because I couldn't put it on. I just told Cat that she couldn't have a Kleenex and it was pretty funny. I really like college and all the people I have met so far. They are so nice and I love them.  ‎stream of consciousness‎0
‎I suppose we all get caught up in a web our first year. I wonder sometimes if it is going to be too much for me to handle. I guess everyone feels the way I do. People sure make me feel that they are smarter than me though. I should do well. Why not, I have just as much potential as the next person. This person sitting  next to me now is making me tense. I wonder why. Come on Chris, your a Drama  major, your not suppose to feel nervous. I feel better now that she left though. Man some of these people really type fast. I don't even hear any pauses. Great, another victim sitting next to me. I suppose we are all victims though. I wonder what everyone else wrote on this paper. It feels a little odd. Seems kind of like my mind just rambles on. I guess everyone's does though. I really need to speed up my typing. I used to be so quick. I really have a lot of stuff to do today. Man I miss my best friends. I miss Kelly even though I hate to admit it. It seems like I tell her that more than I tell anyone else. Maybe she is the same way. I know she probably is making up some reason why I don't love her anymore. She is just whiny like that. I wish she wasn't so negative. I'm always going to love her. Too bad she is in Dallas. Ok, somebody turn on the air in here. It is  getting a little warm. I wonder what Bret and Brian are up to. I know Courtney is mad at me but I only wish she knew the way Chad really is. I mean, it is not like I'm the only one telling her to watch out. Ten minutes to go, or is it five? Oh well, I'll just keep pecking at the keys. I really don't want to go to class today. I don't know how people can skip though. That is all I need is to get  behind on all my work. I still have another one of these things to write tomorrow. My classes are cool though. I shouldn't panic too much. Come on, I'm only taking 12 hours. But then, I am just a fish. I'm sure most people feel the same way. I know Micah does. I wonder if he ever goes out and does anything. I'm really surprised that he came to Mihir's party with us. Ahhh, he had a good time. This  city is definitely not Dallas. I hate to admit it, but, I think I like it better  there.

I PERSONALLY FEEL THAT COLLEGE IS A OLD WAY OF THINKING. I FEEL THAT ONE IS BROUGHT UP TO BELIEVE THAT THEY HAVE TO FOLLOW A CERTAIN TRACK IN LIFE ALL TO OFTEN. WITH THE WAY THAT THE ECONOMY IS NOW AND THE WAY THAT JOB SECURITY IS, I FOUND IT HARD TO BELIEVE IN THE BELIEF THAT ONE SHOULD GO TO COLLEGE GET AN EDUCATION AND GO OFF INTO TO WORK FORBE AND WORK THERE WAY UP THE COPORATE LADDER.

‎"""""""Today is the first day of the rest of your life"""" is what I remember my parents saying to me at graduation two years ago. Back then, I was having some serious problems and nobody, including myself, knew what to do. But now, after that wild madness of that first semester in 1999 all has seemed to calm down. I don't know what it was that did it. Perhaps it was that one acid trip that I took at last year's Phish concert. Man, its annoying when that red line pops up under misspelled or misrecognizied words. Makes you feel selfcritical. I don't know how I feel now. Ever since this year began, I've been a little more tired than usual. But, I've been a little stressed out, too. Not about classes; naw, they all seem to be just fine. Enjoyable, too. Having sex with that girl Sue was a bad move, though. First of all, she's kind of nuts. I know she's lonely, too. Must be tough coming all the way from California here, but at least her family's from Texas. She's fucked up, though, because she's searching for something outside of herself that's impossible to find: security and peace of mind. It's impossible to really, really find those two things in this world I think. I mean, security's a joke; there are so many factors that we never think about in our daily lives that kind of jab at our illusions. All those things like high paying jobs, retirement funds, etc. are all about security. Personally, I think it's all a bunch of bullshit, but, then again, I'm not an old man nor do I have a family to support. I hope this girl doesn't get racked up. I'm pissed because she told me that she was on birth control, but that was a lie. And, I know that if I'd gotten some loving in the last three years I wouldn't have done it. I used her and I feel rotten for it. But, her desire for something to hold on to and peace of mind are making her irrational, I fear. Somehow, she identifies these two things with me. Don't really know why, because I never really thought of myself in those two ways realistically, but I never said there was anything rational to her thoughts. Man, I hate complaining, but I got to say that I've had some bad luck with women these last few times. First there was Lexi. I'm not really sure what was going on between the two of us, but I'm sure I loved her in some way. Can't speak from her end of the line, though. The problem was just that towards the end of last year when we were on the rocks, I was starting to go mad, and it's hard to handle a distant woman and insanity at the same time. That's kind of a lame excuse, but what else can I say? I haven't really gotten that far yet, though Lord knows I've tried. I was thinking the other‎stream of consciousness‎0

‎"""Ever since this assignment was introduced in class, I've been trying to think about what to write (which totally defeats the purpose of the assignment). It's just that when I sit down at the computer to type something, I usually have a plan or goal in mind, whether it is to write a report about something or type an email to a friend. Never have I just had to sit at a computer and type whatever comes to my mind. I guess that makes me a bit boring in a way because I find it so hard to express myself at times. The other day when you were talking about obsessivecompulsive people, my roommate turned to me and said, """"That's you!"""" I guess I had never really thought about that label applying to me. But once you started listing examples, I had an epiphany. I guess I am obsessivecompulsive in some ways. I like everything neat, clean, and orderly. I can't stand having a dirty living space. I mean, how can you sleep and use the bathroom in a dirty environment? For me, it's just not possible. Plus, I think it's important to be neat and clean because that's the first thing people see when they walk into your room, and how you maintain your room really tells a lot about your personality. I like to make good first impressions and the way I maintain my room is a way of achieving that. I think I get a lot of this from my mother because she's really picky about the way she likes to do things. I remember one time I started doing the dinner dishes for her while she was outside in the backyard and when she came in, she pretty much kicked me out of the kitchen because I wasn't washing the dishes """"the right way. """" Of course I can't really complain because I do a lot of that too. I understand that everyone has their own way of doing things, but I just like to do things my way because I see the logic in it. A lot of my friends think I'm a freak for being so neat, clean, and organized, but if I wasn't, I can't even imagine what my life would be like. Being clean and organized is what brings stability into my life. It is something that will never change. I guess I shouldn't say that because every time I say I will never do something, I end up doing it later on. For example, when I was younger, I told my older sister I would never wear lipstick or any other makeup and now if you look in my purse, you will see powder, two shades of lipstick, and lipliner. So I guess that's why I should never say never. I have so much to do today. I probably should have done it yesterday instead of sleeping and watching television all day. Of course I had fun doing crossword puzzles and playing Jeopardy online with my boyfriend. I've always loved playing intellectual‎stream of consciousness‎0

‎Stream of Consciousness that term reminds me so much of Virginia Woolf and my long semester studying her and Mrs. Dalloway. I can't even think about it without thinking of her and her crazy life and the craziness with how Mrs. Dalloway was written and it makes me so sad because her life was just so sad. I feel so bad for her. I wonder how fast twenty minutes really is I bet it may end up seeming forever and this writing will go on forever but I guess it is kind of interesting I just am worried my hands will begin to hurt from all of this typing. I am so glad that it is Labor Day weekend and I am going to get a long weekend to catch up on a few things like sleep and fun and I guess some studying too although that won't be too fun so that will actually take away from some of the fun goal. it is so interesting how I am sitting here all alone in my room and in fact most of the time it gets kind of lonely but sitting her and I some way expressing my thoughts instead of just listening to them and doing nothing makes it not so lonely and for once it is actually quiet in the dorm so that I can concentrate on just about anything. I hope this year goes well because I think that it really needs to be a good semester and that it will progress to a good year I if The semester goes well. I'm getting kind of sad now that because I am leaving town tomorrow I am going to miss the first Football which will be my first Texas football game and I have heard they are a great experience and a ton of fun, but at least there are plenty of other games that I can attend. My hand is really beginning to hurt that is really pretty sad considering I haven't even typed for 10 minutes. I wonder if I am missing out on anything while I am sitting her typing this but I guess it isn't that big of a deal I don't think there are many people her anyway and I don't know where anyone is. I was thinking about how when I graduated from high school that I would be balling my eyes out but I didn't cry then I thought I would cry when My parents left me here all alone. but the weird thing is I haven't cried or anything yet I haven't even gotten homesick. I mean let's face it isn't like I would have anything spectacular to do even if I was home so I guess that helps in the homesickness department.

‎ The past week I have honestly felt the most incredible feeling of being overwhelmed. I am so frustrated and annoyed by everyone around me and everything that they do. I so badly want to step forward and correct everything that these people are doing wrong but for some reason I keep holding myself back. This frustration only makes my head hurt and keeps me angry at the world. My presence then becomes quite rude and unfriendly. I'm not quite sure what to do about this little problem. I really don't think that it's me. My suitemate is about to push me over the edge. She never picks up after herself, never helps clean the dorm room, never buys and groceries (even though she finds its all right to consume mass quantities of the food that me and my two other roomates buy), and she basically is worthless around the room. For example, the other day she mentioned that we needed paper towels and bottled water. On most circumstances that wouldnt bother me, however, she makes these claims but at the same time takes no initiative to fix them. She just assumes that me or my roomates will take care of the missing items in the room. She is from Beverly Hills. Im under that impression that she had someone to pick up after her and do everything for her when she lived there. Typical if you ask me. I just can't handle her behavior or her attitude anymore. On top of that, I am homesick. I miss my friends. I miss being with Richie. He'll call me once and a while. Usually he'll call me non stop for a straight week, and then I won't hear from him for quite a while. I get so anxious to hear from him, but he acts like he could care less if he talked to me. That makes me so mad. My roomate aka my best friend since middle school chastises me everytime i talk to him. It just makes me so upset that she thinks that he doesnt care about me in the least. Sure, he may not show the normal feelings that most people show towards the ones that they care about, but I know that he cares about me. If he didnt care, he wouldnt bother calling me. Its honestly one of the worst feelings knowing that your best friend in the world is sitting there making fun of you and getting annoyed by the fact that you are in a complete state of happiness when you talk to the one person you care about. It really makes me wonder why she is the one person I confide in the most. Speaking of her, she is in this relationship with a boy whom I adore as a friend. He is so much fun to be around, but he is here all the time. I turn around and he is always there.

‎con't go by. oh well. My mom should be coming home soon. She helps out with the orchestra director at my high school, I'm from Austin and am typing from home by the way, not like you really care. hmmmm. . but tonight's back to school night and thats a really big night for elementary, middle, and high schools. I didn't make the symphony last week. I didn't play my best audition so I shouldn't be suprised but I had really wanted to make it, but the University orchestra is playing some really awesome music this semester. We're playing Egmont by Beethoven, a Mendhelson piano concerto, the Mother Goose Suite by Ravel, and Second Essay for Strings by Barber. I played Adagio by Barber in high school, oh, that was an amazing performance. If there were a lever that I could press that would make me feel like I do when I'm playing a truly amazing concert I would press that all the time. I hope that I will have the same feelings in college, its just that High School orchestra was so awesome and amazing with Mr. Edwards, he picked music that we could play and that was really good too. I mean come on, Overtures to Candide, the Merry Wives of Windsor, Tancredi, and Ruslan and Ludmilla just to name a few. And in AYO, Austin Youth Orchestra, we played the full, I mean the FULL COMPLETE the Planets by Holst. People would ask me   oh, what movements?   and I would be like ALL OF THEM BABY!!! Oh!! and Scheherezade! that was a. . ahh!!! I can't even express how utterly amazing that concert was. Wow, I love music so much, but Music Theory is a pain in the ass. Not that it's all bad, alot of it is nice, but tedious. I just can't figure out and easy way for me to identify major and minor intervals. I can easinly identify perfect fifths and octaves but most people can. Well, techinically its easier for me because my instrument is tuned in fifths so each of my strings are a fifth apart and octaves, well, those are just the same note. My high school band friends love what they do so much. Its refreshing in a way to see them having the time of their life playing and having fun, doing what they love, and that is my goal too. I'm in music because I have fun doing it, recieve a joy unsurpassed doing it, and give a joy to others also. Hopefully I'm going to go se Le Mis next week. I haven't seen it yet, and I just really really really want to, but the tickets are expensive, heck any tickets are expensive now adays, but when weren't they?  So if my friends don't want the really expensive seats I am going with them. ‎stream of consciousness‎0

‎     I somtimes worry that my life is just some meaninless collection of random accidents culmintating in a demise that will be unremembered. thoughtout human history we have constantly tried to leave behind something that represents our existence. for example you have the great prymids of gisa where all the old pharros are barried. you have all the wonders of the wolrd that also represent the same thing. Another way that people leave things behind in the form of their children. I guess that having a child is one of the other things that i am worried about. I just hope that when I have one I can do enough so that they will grow up to be a great person. I did not really have a father when i was young because my real one left me when I was very young. I had a step-father so I supose that I sort of have an idea what its like to have a real dad. I don't know if me and my stepdad get along well enought sometimes, I mean its not like I hate him or dislike him or anything but sometimes its just like he gets on my nerves. My mom says that a son haveing problems with a father is akin to a daughter having problems with the mother, its some wierd behavior pattern or something that trys to get the child to strike out on its own or became the alpha male/female something. I have always been very interested in martial arts, I don't know hwat it is about it that draws me to it. Its just that when I see these small guys break 15 flamming bricks I feel inspired, its like if I could do something like braking 15 flamming bricks that  I could do anything. Its like a martial artists have somehow trancended human limitations and have becomesomthing else. Its like that whole uberman thing that neiche talks about. I wonder if the statement about power corrupting is always true. Can you ake a decent person a corrupt them with power and completly change their entire outlook on life. I think that there are some people that even if given absolute power would not use it and would serve as a benevolent ruler. Just yesterday I was playing a game called DEUS EX and at ther very end you had the choice of merging with a super-inteligent computer and ruling the world, killing the current tyrant and ruling the world behind the scenes as a memeber of a secret organization called the illumiti, or blowing up this one building that you were in and completly destroy the wolrds global network which would reduce the world to a isoltated city state type  environment. I did all three endings but non of them really struck a cord in me as being the correct action. ‎stream of consciousness‎0

‎"""Well, hello. I am really not sure what to write about, I guess I can start with my day. You see, I am a commuter. I live in Bastrop. No one in Austin seems to know where that is but it is a little town on the other side of the airport. So, anyway, that means that I have the privilege of driving through morning traffic for an hour just to get to class, then what is even worse it that I get to drive back home through five o'clock traffic. It is a pain in the backside. I hate Austin Drivers. On the up side, I was lucky enough to schedule all 15 hours on Monday, Wednesday and Friday. That helps because I am also a Parttime employee with fulltime hours at the only department store in Bastrop. Three years ago the store opened meaning that Bastrop now had a WalMart, HEB, and Bealls. That is about it for stores. So, about my job, I am a Sales Associate. We recently switched new districts into the Austin area. The District Manager is very strict on how the store is arranged. Last week, whoever did the schedule only scheduled me to work on Saturday for Five hours. You can not pay bills working at a minimum wage job for five hours a week. So I told my Store Manager that I would be more than happy to come in if she needed any help prior to Annette (the District manager) coming in on that Friday. In the end I worked ten days in a row, pulling in forty hours before Friday when the District Manager was going to be in to audit. I was exhausted by the time Sunday rolled around. I was thankful that my Manager let me have Sunday off, I needed the rest. Today is my anniversary, I have been dating a guy for eight months now. This is probably of no concern to you but I am very proud of that fact. He goes to Incarnate Word in San Antonio. He is an Eagle Scout and spends all summer teaching camp at Lost Pines Boy Scout Reservation. On weekends, he comes back to Bastrop to ref. Soccer games at the BYSO Soccer fields. All this volunteering helped him when it came to my parents approval. You know, one time in my Drama Class, a friend of mine started to do just a stream of consciousness monologue. In the end he was talking about mixed drinks and jelly beans, it was very funny. I miss my Drama Class. Most of my high school stuff I had to give up due to the need to be able to afford college and get my degree. I had to quit dancing, I had danced for 13 years at a local studio. Then I had to give up Color Guard, an organization that I was the captain of for all four years of High school. Most upsetting though was giving up Drama.

‎The one thing that amazes me the most is the  complexity of the female mind. At one point, you think you know exactly what they want, but as soon as you can comfortably assume that, it all gets twisted around and kicks you in the ass. Also, when you are on the flip side of goodbye, you really start to understand the importance of relationships. If you are always on the winning team, you don't know what it would be like to lose. The more you win, the more you will think yourself invincible until you are brought down, and then you feel the most devastating emotion you have ever felt. The only difference is that with relationships, you never think about losing, especially if youre on a winning streak. True, some people will never have to experience being on the heartbreaking side of goodbye, but if you keep playing the game, eventually you will lose. No matter how much success you have after your loss, even if it is a bigger victory, you will always remember the loss you experienced and try to figure it out. I've found myself racking my brain to try and figure out something that I will ever be able to understand. The saying that time will heal all wounds is a load of crap. Time only allows wounds to fester and become infected. I think that relationships are more like getting drunk more than anything else. The more you drink it in, the better it feels. You know that the feeling won't last forever, but you keep doing it anyway, always hoping. Then it ends, and all hell breaks loose in your head. Reality hits you because you have nothing to swing back at it. The only way to lessen the pain is to start working on the next round. The old pain is still there, but youve managed to cover it up with something that will eventually add to the old pain. It may seem that i'm depressed, but in reality i just try to figure things out, and if i cant, i find similarities between two things that i can't understand. Somehow it feels like i've found a solution that way. That or it seems less pathetic.     It's odd that when youre young, you always think that you'll be different from the stereotypes when you get older. When I was little, i always used to wonder why musicians would include foul language and sexual references in their records. My parents didn't like the subjects of many of the songs that I listened to, so I always told myself that if I ever became a musician, I would never include those kind of things in my songs. However, now it is apparent to me (through personal experience) that these things are boosters in the audience's attention span. However, I wonder if standards have changed, especially since the dawn of Eminem. I also think that people overreact to his music. He is simply writing about what he knows and how‎stream of consciousness‎0
‎last line wasn't true. I made it up. This is a trait I picked up from my friend who moved to Texas Tech. We would all sit around talking and making up elaborate, obviously fake stories just to make each other laugh. So in the memory of my old friend I hope that made you laugh. My twenty minutes are now up so I hope you enjoyed my train of thought. I'm not sure if this is what I was supposed to do but I guess it doesn't matter since it is a completion grade. So I must say goodbye for now. Peace. ‎stream of consciousness‎0
‎     This is the first writting assingment. I don't realy know what I am soposed to write about. I am also afraid that I will mispell a lot of words. I was talking with a friend on the way to class today. And we started to talk about this assingment. It made me kind of nervouse. But I guess he survived so I will too. I can't belive that only two minutes have passed. I guess that is why it takes so long to write all my papers. And why they are so short. Some times I write a stream of consciousness down on paper. I think it is a good way to get my mind clear. If you write it all on paper you can forget it all for a while. Then after you have rested with it all off your shoulders you can read thoguh it and see if any of it was something important that you need to look into or if not ohh well at least you no longer are thinking about it. I feel like   i should be talking about something more important. But I don't have anything important to talk about. My friend, The guy I mentioned earler, He said that he made sure that he was in a bad/wierd mood befoer he started writing so that way he would have a lot to write about. I think that was probably a good idea. I kind of wish I did that. I feel like I am running out of things to say. So I guess that I will talk about what I see hear smell. Well I am in my room. I see the wall in fromt of me. I hear the computer game my room-mate is playing. He always plays a computer game. Always. but he is a real good guy. The computer game he is playing is some shoot um'up game. You run around with a gun ald kill people, Sleep with one eye open you say right? No its cool. Well I hear all the guns and what not and in the back ground, I guess because he can multi-task I hear music. he plays music movies and this game all at the same time. 10 Min!!! I don't like the song that just came on. What I see I see pictures on my wall. One is with my friend Laurie, We were at Camp in North carolina. We were in her cabin before the campers came. She had these two toy firefighters helmets in her cabin, that light up and have a siren when you push the button. So we were running around camp with them on our heads. It was kind of fun. I have know Laurie for a long time. We grew up togther. We went to camp togther and youth group conventions. She is realy up beat and friendly. Camp is a great place. I went there when I was a kid, And now I have been staff the past three summers.‎stream of consciousness‎0

‎"""right now I am feeling tired and a little burnt out. I have had a quiz and a test this week so I ve been stressed out. I haven't taken my chemistry test yet so I'm nervous about that. I have studied but I don't feel prepared. It's cold in our dorm room right now. It's cloudy outside which is how I feel about certain aspects in life. I'm not sure I will accomplish my goals in life. Though I know that if I give it my best effort that there is nothing more I could have done. No one is in the room other than me so I'm feeling a little lonely. Not too much though. Sometimes it is nice to be alone. I have always enjoyed being alone everynow and then. I feel like I need to relax. I didn't get tickets to the game this Saturday so I'm pissed about that. I did get tickets to the OU game though so that made me happy. I like to listen to music. It also helps me to relax. I'm listening to music right now as a matter of fact. I have a heavy course load, though not too bad. I know that if I quit that I'll regret it for the rest of my life. I think regret is probably one of the worst feelings in the world next to loneliness. Loneliness you could almost always fix, but regret is much harder to deal with. Time is going by too slowly, I think I'm running out of stuff to talk about. It does feel good to get your feelings out and onto something like paper. Sometimes I think it would be better to write out all your feelings on paper so that someone wouldn't have to sit there and listen to you bitch about your life all the time. But other times that's exactly what you need. My favorite TV show is Scrubs. The main character portrays me down to a T"""". Watching Scrubs is another way I relax. I'm not necessarily worried about my chemistry test, or at least not to the point of where I'm dreading going. I know that all I can do is my best. I know I've talked about this but I love music. I can feel it in my soul when it plays. I can feel the song. I can feel the notes, the rhythms, all of it. I can close my eyes and just get lost in a song. It's weird, I know. My time is almost up. I'm hungry. It seems like now that I'm thinking about how hungry I am that it is taking longer to finish than it did before. I'm writing this at 9:15 a. m. That's not necessarily early in my book but it is definitely too early to do this. I have a lot of reading to do. I'm happy to be at UT. It's what I have wanted to do all my life.

I really miss Big Brother 3, but I really can't find enough hours in the day. It makes me sad :(  I have a latin quiz on Friday, I don't know how well I'm going to do. I have flashcards for the vocabulary words, and they seem to be helping, so I think I'm going to go back and make flashcards for all of the paradigms. That's the hard part!  The paradigms aren't very different than spanish, but they are. I get them confused sometimes. I'm upset that I went to College Station this weekend and missed church. I really wanted to go this Sunday, but instead I went to Mass with my friend at College Station. I had fun in CS, and I definitely didn't want to stay here with my roommate, but I would have rather been back for the service. Oh well, I can go on Sunday. I start my job tomorrow!!  I'm kind of nervous about that. I've never had a job before. What if I really screw up??  And what if I'm not able to get from my job to my classes on time?  On Tuesday and Thursday, I'll have no problem, but what about Friday?  I work from 9-1, and I have a class at one. on the other side of the campus. I wish I would have just told her that I'd like to go into work an hour earlier on Thursday and then I could get out of work an hour earlier on Friday morning. That would have been perfect. But oh, well. What doesn't kill you only makes you stronger. . I took the pretest for the psych experiments and it seemed like it took forever!!  I didn't think I'd ever finish it.

‎so far this class seems alright. I means the girls in this class look pretty good. there's this one girl in there, I haven't talked to her yet but I have to because she 's always looking at me. she looks pretty cute, but I can tell she is young. there's this other Hispanic girl  who has real tight curly hair . she looks incredible. shit all the girls in there do well who ever is reading this can probably tell hat I think about sex a lot. its strange because I always find myself daydreaming about having a wife and kids, you know having a real family. going to visit y folk and other friends with my kids. but it like no how hard I try, after I have sex with a lady, I just lose total respect for them, I just look at there flaws and I only look at the negative. with me, the way I think about a girl is totally different after we engage in hot intense intimacy. some times I don't know if it is just irrational thought processes or what. I know its not normal. but what is normal. normal is what society says is ok. but who is the society, whites blacks Hispanic, the melting pot of the us. or the world. there are so many different cultures and societies that essayist that who is to say that their ways are better then anybody else's. how can you say that is right and that is wrong because society deems it that way. if society is forever changing, are our moral standards to be forever changing as well. well it has been so far in our human history.         times up, nice talking with you ‎stream of consciousness‎0

This is why we have so much apathy towards other humans we don't know. Some think that if we have our computer to talk to why do we need human interaction. We need human interaction more than we need contact with technology. I would rather have a good conversation with another human than a brief relationiship with a television, computer, or some other device. But what about technology as an assistance to human interaction. This is a good thing as long as it's not relied on too heavily  to subsitute for personal contact.

I mean, Jason and I have been together for about 8 � monthssmall on the grand scale of things, I know, but it seems like an eternity. In fact, I find it very hard to remember what my lifestyle was like before Jason. He is, after all, my first real serious relationship. And I don't know. I mean, yeah, he is my first relationship, and yeah, it is a relationship from high school, but it is so damn HARD to keep what we have in college. I love him. I mean really love him. He says that he isn't sure if what he feels is love. I think that if you're in love, then you KNOW. So that means that he probably doesn't love me. We're lopsided. So that kind of sucks, but I deal with it, you know? I mean, sometimes it gets me down because when I say, """"I love you"""" I don't hear one back. So, I get depressed. But he assures me that what he does feel is as real as it gets and I guess that's enough to suffice. Maybe sometimes I feel like I just have enough love for the two of us, but other times I become really doubting. Maybe I don't love him either. I mean, maybe he's righthow do you know what love really is? How do we know that love even really exists? How do we know?

‎It is kind of hard to just do this on the spot like this. Well, let me see. I am thinking about a guy/friend that I have. He is not being very honest with me. It seems like he is trying to trick me into thinking that he is a really nice guy, but I know better now. He is just going behind my back. He got this new girlfriend and we had been going out before and we had agreed to stay friends, which I thought was a really good idea. But now he is trying to leave me hints to his new girl, but he won't just come out and say anything. He is just being really dishonest. Now I am thinking about how bored all of the reader of this project. How you all may have a real problem and I am fixated on stupid stuff. I am sure you that whoever is reading this must thing I am a really big idiot. Well when it comes to problems I am. I can't ever seem to settle things without messing up. It is such a shame that I can be good at stupid things like science, but I can't seem to solve anything without being upset. I guess I am so worried about what the other person thinks that I just ignore the fact that I need to look out for myself too. You know I can't really understand why I need to reveal my thoughts to some complete stranger.

‎"""Today was pretty interesting. for a Monday. I only had two classes (Calculus and my favorite class with my favorite professor Mr. Pennebaker, who is an inspiration to me and an overall wonderful, smart, and funny guy). Do I get an A?  Anyway, my friend and I are waiting until about 11 pm so we can go to Blockbuster to buy """"Titanic. """"  Yes, we're crazy girls. Blockbuster is actually having a small Titanic party to celebrate its release. Phenonenal, huh?  I think so. Wow, only four minutes have gone by. I guess I type too fast. I     w  I  l  l    s  l  o  w     d  o  w  n. My roommate just asked me if I would hate her if she turned into a lesbian. Random question, huh?!  I told her """"No. """"  She is trying out for rowing and another girl said that there are a lot of lesbians that are on the team. It grosses her out, but she's still curious and thinks it might not be that bad. I think it's perfectly normal, especially in college, to be curious about those kind of things. I am. How many movies have they made about college kids trying out new stuff?  Now is the perfect time to explore our sexuality. It does bother me that she thinks she will """"turn into"""" a lesbian without her consent. Is that even possible?  I don't think it is. Some people say that you're born gay and that it's not their fault. I don't know. I wish I did, but I don't. I guess I'll just have to see what happens.     """‎stream of consciousness‎0
‎made up games to express myself. My imagination was as abundant as the grown-up books I read. The stuff everyone else hated. The big thick books on science, philosophy and religion. When people were still learning their multiplication tables. Science fiction. Fantasy. Anything that made life a little more exciting and unpredictable. And I wanted to escape. Straight A's, top of all my classes, and only a pat on the back. Still not good enough, because no one would share it. They wanted to play outside, go to the bayou, ride bikes, play in puddles, watch a movie, go to a party, raise hell. I just wanted to be alone. With my books. My imagination. And I've never had a close friend, because I was always so afraid of betrayal. So afraid that I would be cast out, and many times I was, when I just wanted to think. Now I don't know if there is much else than my own thoughts, and there is nothing for them to do but bounce around in my head. I hope for someone who can share my mind. Someone who can relate to life, looking back on it, reflecting, not just living it.          ‎stream of consciousness‎0

But I'm not little anymore,  and they need to let me go and explore the world, but I�m Indian; with Indian culture, with Indian values. They go against """"having fun.

‎School nobody would talk to me. I think I scared them. But here it's different. Here people don't seem to care. I think I have to give the whole """"God you're so HOT lets be boyfriend girlfriend"""" thing a few more years, but I can live with just friends, for now. That's always bothered me though. How people, no matter how smart or mature they are, are obsessed with looks. Personally, I don't want my girlfriend/fiance/wife to be gorgeous by society's definition. I feel that every woman in one way or another is beautiful, as cheesy as that may sound. I've met people that I'd like to get to know better, and they aren't model types. I've seen those types too and they don't impress me much at all. But I think the real thing that's keeping me from getting to know any of the people I'd like to know better is my shyness. I'm not used to being social, so being thrown into a dorm with so many other social people is a strange change for me. It takes some getting used to. I need to adapt I guess, become more comfortable with my surroundings and my place in the surroundings. My friend Casey became engaged too. That scares me. He's 18 I think, maybe 19, probably 18. Right now, I'm only 17 but I can not see myself getting engaged to be married in a year. 18 years, when the average lifespan of a person is over 70. That's 50 years, a long time to stay married. And if I do get married I never want to get a divorce. I'd rather spend another year making sure she's the one than finding out a year into our marriage when my wife might be with child or something else. Maybe I'm just old fashioned, but I think that's the way it should be. But I can't tell Casey that. it's his life, I've seen him and Melissa together and they are a good couple, but people change you know. Maybe it's just my fear of the unknown or maybe it's true, but marriage ties you down, it keeps you from changing, it's binding. I'd hate to see Casey or Melissa's life ruined by this. Or at least I hope they don't get married until much later, and just stay engaged. Maybe I care too much and maybe it's none of my business, but this is just my stream of consciousness and it doesn't matter beyond my own mind. """‎stream of consciousness‎0

‎Sometimes I wonder what everything is worth in the big scheme of things. Growing up, making friends, going to school, learning amazing things, falling in love, and well, I guess living in general. What is our purpose here. to consume as much food as possible on a daily basis, to desire nothing but to be rich, spoiled, to care not for our neighbors, but for what kinds of cars we drive. I wonder if that was His plan when this all started or if we've really messed up. In a sense, we've grown as far from following in his steps as possible and it's really scary to me. As a follower of the times, my faith in Him has also declined as the years have gone on. Well, on to another aspect of worthiness. friendships. Although necessary for life, and powerful while they last, why do all friendships seem to come to an end. Whether it is due to personal reasons or unplanned ones, each and every friendship must reach an end at some time. As I entered high school, I was very afraid of my future, of the immensity of my school, and the immensity of my life. But I realized that life is only as big as you make it. If you choose, you can have a closeknit group of friends or a large selection of various types of friends. its up to you. But back to my point. I made many friends in high school, but only a handful that will continue to have my friendship as I've moved to the next step in my life. My five best friends, my girlfriend, and a few others are only a hundredth of the people that I knew in my high school days, but now they are most likely out of my life forever, not by choice, but by nature. Don't get me wrong, I am very excited to be in college and out of high school, but I don't think that I realized what I was losing. My best friend with whom I spent countless days after school shooting hoops, watching movies, ordering pizza, and just hanging out decided to go to another school than me. I didn't realize how much I would miss him until he left. When I see him for the first time, it's going to be a relief, but when will that time come, and it's only going to last for short period of time. My girlfriend also chose another school, but hers was four states away. I knew leaving her would be most difficult, but I underestimated the pain. I miss seeing her every day and hearing about the intricate details of her life. what she had for breakfast, how her math test was, what she wore to school, when she got off work, how her family was, and many other little things that are often ignored when someone is around all the time. I feel like I don't know her as well as I used to and I wonder if I ever will.‎stream of consciousness‎0

‎As I sit in front of my computer, trying to put my thoughts into words all I can think about is how tired I am. I am unable to concentrate on any given task that is related to school. All I see in the corner of my eye, is my roommate trying on my favorite black dress. I can't help but laugh, because she just got the sudden urge to try on my clothes. I feel distracted in many ways, because while I am trying to write this psychology paper my friends keep coming in and out of my room. This makes me feel that I am missing out, and I want to join in on the fun. I am also feeling very excited, because tomorrow is finally Friday and I get to see my best friend from high school. She goes to A&M, and it will be interesting to see how life is in Aggieland. This week was stressful and I am ready for a break. I find this assignment quite hard for many reasons. I am not comfortable with expressing my feelings or thoughts to a stranger. I also find this paper difficult because I have so many random thoughts running through my head and I don't want to sound ignorant. For instance, right now I am wondering why our neighbors constantly blare their music. It is very annoying, and is hard to concentrate. Right now the phone is ringing, and I am yet again distracted. I wonder who is on the other end and I am disappointed to find out that the call is not for me. It is hard being a freshman at a huge university such as UT but it makes it a hundred times better because I am rooming with one of my best friends from high school. Right now I am thinking about how much laundry we have left to do. Not fun! I have been writing my thoughts now for about 20 minutes, and I feel as though I wrote probably the most boring paper ever but those were my thoughts that crossed my mind!  ‎stream of consciousness‎0
‎"""This is my writing I always feel like everything should have a title. Somebody told me I was anal last night. I don't think so though. I've always thought myself to be rather easygoing. Church always made us be nice to people. That's another thing, people always tell me that I'm """"like the nicest person I've ever met!"""". I don't see it. I may be easygoing but I do not consider myself nice. I think I'm just not mean so people think I'm nice. I'm not. You should see how I treat the men in my life. The poor boys don't have a clue. Marques hopefully will never find out because I actually do love him a lot but I just can't seem to settle down for anything. That's got to be some kind of mental deficiency don't you think. Oh well, around this campus I think I am one of the only sane people around here. I'm saying that like I think I'm sane. I don't think I am. I like William a lot too. He's so strong and """"Mr. Cool"""" like. I'm always attracted to the strong cute ones. I guess it's some kind of complex about my tiny stature that I always go after big men. I can't believe Marques got up to almost 300 pounds this summer. He is really making me mad though because he is not helping my constant state of confusion that I have been dealing with lately. I hate typing. I don't have anything to say anymore. I wish I had a twinkie and a juice box. I do need to go to the grocery store. Eckerds is just up the street though so I'll go up there if I can ever get caught up on all my work. I am going to try to make it to the Delta party tonight. I think everybody's going to be there. I hope William is there. He's such a cutie and he likes me a whole lot. He gave me these two massive hickies on the sides of my neck. They look really bad and they kind of hurt too. Oh well, at least I've found somebody that I like. I wish Marques was here so that I could take my mind off of all these cute men. My nursing class is cool. Are you sure that you wanted us to just type whatever comes to our minds. Well, I don't think you want to get inside my mind. There's a whole lot of stuff that should not be open to the public right now. I guess everybody thinks like this though. I can't call myself different because sometimes I know that I am different. I don't think like everybody else I know. I think I'm a little bit on the crazier side than they like to think I am. Okay, I have been typing for 12 minutes now.

It starts at 7:30 or 8:00 in the morning and the beeping goes on all day long. My roommate wants to know how much work those trucks can actually accomplish when they are driving backwards!  lol, I agree and would really like to know, all I see when I look out my window is a big whole in the ground, not to much progress. but I am sure the construction will be moving along slowly but surely. Oy veh, I have not typed in such a long time, I have gotten so slow. I am just like my grandma, new technology drives me nuts. My computer, phone, everything, too confusing!  I like having no alarm clock or phones or computers or anything, but its all just part of america I guess, so along the lines of beeping, the door to my floor is beeping again, the alarm has gone off every time someone goes in or out of the door. It's all part of dorm life I guess, luckily I can sleep through anything so it doesn't really bother me much, just when I am trying to study but that is why we have libraries. I am a little worried though that I won't wake up is there is a fire drill or something. My roommate (I wonder how you spell that - room mate?  roommate? or roommate?) anyhow, she will wake me up. thank goodness. my suitemates just made dinner even though its late and it smells YUMMY!  I think it's pork though so I'll have to miss out on this one. It's amazing the things you can cook in the microwave these days. EZmac seems a little scary but most food turns out pretty good. I really miss my moms cooking, I think that is got to be one of the hardest parts of being away from home, the food and the fact that me family would always eat together. It's so quiet here I can tell the weekend is winding down. Friday and Saturday nights are so noisy and something is always happening. Now its all hush hush. I've only been typing for nine minutes and I can't believe how much random stuff I have thought of. I took a Yoga class today with a friend, I had never taken one before and somehow you move around for like an hour and come out of the class feeling like you just took a great nap for the whole time.

‎deserve that   a  . Great Im already negotiating for my grade and the instructor hasnt even seen this assignment. I wonder if this class will ever offer extra credit if ever im in need of some assistance? I doubt it especially if most of my high school teachers would just laugh if the subject was brought up. But then again a lot of those teachers had massive egos even though some of them had readon to have them. Ironically the teacher who had the most reason to have an ego was the most down to earth and lenient. Is lenient even a word? Oh well anyhow the teacher, her name was Ms. Ng, she scored perfect on her SAT's. How the heck did she ever pull that off. And since she did I have no idea why shes teaching at Edison. In case you dopnt know which you probably don't Edison is a public inner-city school in San Antonio and it does not have the best of reputations. I hate that though because any time your talking to someone important and you think your sounding intelligent and going somewhere with your conversation they would always seem to ask what school do you go to? And that great conversation just plummets to hell when you respond   Edison  . Esdpecially with teen-agers who think they are too good to even know of someone from Edison. Well thats their loss because Im a great person to know and I don't fit the   Edison   stereotype. There should be no stereotypes. They are just not fair.

I haven't seen her in a week, which I'm sure doesn't sound like a long time, but she used to be my neighbor when I lived at my parents house so I'm still kind of used to seeing her everyday. She is going to go to massage therapy school somewhere around here. I always forget the name of it, but it's supposed to be not very far away from campus. Now my hand is starting to hurt from typing all this crap. I think if I reread this, I'd probably think I was crazy. All of this is pretty random. I want the phone to ring because now I'm in the mood to talk to him. He is not very nice sometimes, but sometimes he really is. I think this is probably a bad situation. He wants us to be friends. He is a good friend, he is just not very good at being anything more than friends. He is not a very good people person I guess. My roommate is rolling around in her bed, it's kind of distracting. I have a pencil from the greensheet and I don't remember where I got or who could have possibly left it here. Where did it come from?  Do people actually read the greensheet?  I've never seen someone reading it. Kinda weird. My mom works for the Austin American Statesman, but she doesn't write or take pictures or anything like that, she works in HR. Time must be almost up.

‎I am almost done with my pre-testing survey. I think I have 92% of it done. I would have finished it, but I got kicked off. I will try again later. I am excited right now about tonight because I am going to see Shania Twain in concert. I am starting to listen to country now, and I really like it. I like it because the songs actually are saying something, and not just rambling on. Most of the songs deal with love and life, which I find very interesting. This weekend I might go home. That is why I wanted to finish the pre-testing and the writing assignments either today or tomorrow, so that I can go home if I decided to. I have mixed feelings about going home. I want to go home because on of my friends' step-father has cancer and is not doing well at all. The doctors didn't give him much time. His family is having a benefit bar-b-que to raise money to help pay his medical bills. I am not that close to my friends' family, and I am somewhat close to my friend, so I don't know if I should go home and help out or not. My services were not asked for, however, I think it would be a kind gesture to go down and help, because extra help is always useful during things like this. Also, I would appreciate a friend's help if I was in a situation like this. Also, my cousin and his fianc� are having their engagement party on Saturday evening. I don't really want to go because those things are usually boring, but I am standing up in the wedding, so I thought it would be nice to go. If I can't make it they will understand, in fact I don't think I would even be missed that much, but you never know. I don't want to go home because I just went home two weekends ago. I am kind of confused as to whether or not I will go, but I have tonight to decide. Right now I am kind of feeling good about myself because I just got the results back from a test I took Wednesday in my Medical and Science Terminology Class. I got a 104. The highest grade you could get was a 107, so I did pretty good. Also, my sister (who is two years older than I) and I are taking the same class and we were kind of competing to see who gets a better grade. The night before, she thought she had it all down and was confident that she would do better than I. However, She ended up getting a 92 on the test. So I feel good about myself because in a way I proved myself to her. Now, though, I have to continue to do well so that at the end of the semester I can have a good grade, and even maybe it will be better than hers.

He is one of those, Everything has to my my way"""" guys and he cannot conform to anyone's wishes but his own. I took Spanish for three years in high school and I like to speak in that language sometimes for fun. He got mad at me and my other friend for talking in """"Spanglish"""" because he does not like it. He gave us a ultimatum and I got ticked. Man to day was rough. Seinfield is on. That is a good show. Kramer is the best character because he physical comedy is on par with Jim Carrey's. The timer says 3 minutes 20 seconds and even this feels like forever. I have a lot of chores to do.

I need to get something to drink but I cannot get up for another 15 minutes. Oh well. I need to change my calendar. The stupid thing is still in August. The candle in my hallway has a strong odor as I can smell it clearly all the way down in my room. Cool. They are playing The Rock on USA. I think I'll watch this as I type. It should keep me halfway amused instead of bored. I got a Economics quiz tomorrow and I am not looking forward to that. My professor is great though. A very funny man, he has a way of putting micro-economics into a state relative to us college students. His examples, while off-the-wall, are pertinent and really do have a good meaning. He even sold us this bag of 3 Musketeers he had. He must have made at least $5 off a bag that I could get at Wal-Mart for about $2.

‎Well, I don't know, or should I say that I am not sure on much right now. I feel like I've always tried to be good and kind and honest, especially honest. Now, it's not like much of any of those, beause I am not right to Ryan. Oh Ryan, I don't know why I have done and do the things I do. Some people aren't right in your life. Ryan's right because he is comfortable. Others are old and dirty and uncaring. Yet, I am still spending all this time and energy on them. Not thinking much of myself, am I?  Do I? Will I ever? It's like I always have the right things all planned out--like Nathaniel tells me--but I never have the confidence to follow through with everything I dream or how I want or wish to be. I want to be strong and I don't want to be taken advantage of for the rest of my life. I want to be pretty and I want to be skinny like I was when I was fifteen with long brown hair. I can go back to that. I just have to run, run like I did and eat much less. I have a perfect vision of what I want to be but I always set myself up to fail. I won't follow through but I must. I must be honest with my feelings toward Ryan, not honest with what happenned, just with my feelings because I do care about him. I do. I don't want to hate myself right now. sometimes, someimes when I'm alone with my thoughts I think too much about all of it, I feel dirty, dirty and ashamed, and all I want is someone to hold me and tell me that they know and they still care and they still like me and they want to be there, that's what I thought Greg was or is. critical though. He can be so critical, but he said he called--called like he nevercalls anyone he misses. He missed me enough to call me. more than I thought I would. we said more than we thought we would greg and nathaniel make me want to be a better person. I always want nathaniel to see me in the right way--he knows, greg too, they still care. But I am always like that questioning whether anyone does. maybe the thing will work and I will be happy- not eat more. iam afraid to eat more, but I probably won't if I do it right. But I want to get all nice looking for when I seee greg at Christmas. I want him to think I am pretty, he will, no more diritness-- it's ending soon, but I have to get the pictures back.

‎I'm going nuts. I haven't gotten anything done today except a shower. I didn't get my parking permit. I really need to get that so I can have my car on campus. That would make my commute to work in north Austin a lot less painful. I can't stand riding the bus back and forth. I never know exactly when the bus will arrive. If I'm not there right on time, I get stuck for another half hour or so. I just really want my car here. I also didn't get my Physics books returned. They cost me approximately $200, and they're doing me no good. I'm being booted out of my physics class cause I didn't take calculus. I didn't know until last week that calculus was even a prerequisite. That's ok, though. I didn't really want to take physics this semester anyways. I kinda like this basic, cool class schedule I have. I did get in touch with the guy in charge of the anthropology department, so I can add that cultural anthropology class that I wanted. I hope that will be a cool class. I hope I'm not really far behind since I missed the first two weeks of class. It sounds interesting though. I need to get this class to stay a full-time student. If I'm not, my financial aid will disappear. I also need to get a work/study job for my financial aid. That's another thing I could have done today, but didn't. I went in for an interview at the counseling and mental health center with a Laurel Patterson, but she never showed up. That was very discouraging. There are a few others that I'm interested in. I like the idea of doing nothing for $6. 74/hour. I could be an Entrance Monitor at the Texas Swim Center. Weee! What fun. I don't think that will happen though. I just would like to have a job on campus so I can walk there rather than having to take a bus there or to my car and then drive there. That would be so much of a hassle. And, knowing me, I'd be late a lot. I just wish I could work somewhere on campus. It would make my life easier. I will miss my current job at Sunglass Outfitters. I really like my boss, and my co-workers are pretty cool. I also work right next door to a Thundercloud Subs where I get free food when the night manager's there. He's a really cool guy. He has had a glass eye since he was 2. He's got some crazy stories about that eye. One time when he was 7 he replaced the eye with a cherry, stem and all. He scared the hell out of his grandmother because the stem was just sticking out of his head. It was pretty funny. His girlfriend one time made the mistake of asking him to keep an eye on her books. You can just imagine. He's cool. I will miss hanging out with all of those guys at‎stream of consciousness‎0

I'm not quite sure, when I was like 14 I  made a list of the basic things that my future spouse should have I wonder where I put that or if  he would fit into any of the standards I set for my self. he is the best guy I have dated so far, as  far as how he treats me and respects me so I'm doing all right for myself. I wonder what casey is  doing never mind she just walked in she says this asignment sucks and I agree maybe I will sue  you all for giving me carpal tunnel syndrome casey is leaving again, what a freak not really she is a  cool girl. I just ate so much food added up I had a fajita and a cup of chicken enchillada soup  and an ass load of chips and queso, I'm sure that I am the most gigantic person on the planet  what if I get heartburn from that queso. I am experiencing the sickness brought on by the lull in  my immune system brought on by the stress we talked about today in your class, yes  pennebaker, we do listen and you are quite entertaining, hope I don't forget to read the entire  semester, but at the rate I'm going that's what will happen, I wonder if you are married or if you  ever date your students. god bless your students if so. just kidding.

When I play basketball I wish Dustin would pass me the ball. But he never passes the ball so why am I complaining. My wrists hurts because the keyboard is in the wrong position. But I will not say anything because this is not my computer. I hate this keyboard because the keyboard is sorry. I wish I could go to sleep. But then again I never sleep. I wish Dean would get out of this room. Why did I come here?  I wish I stayed in Houston. Dwan needs to leave now. But he will never leave because he is going to sit down and talk. Kind of like what he is doing know. I hate this song . They play this song way too much. When are they going to leave. I wish Greg would turn off his computer and stop playing the music. I wish this assignment could be shorter but then again the is homework so it is not supposed to be fun. I wish I brought my own computer but I don't care. Greg needs to shut up. Greg is talking to one of his many girls. He has so many that people call him the mack. The computer is going to be burnt out by the time I am done with this assignment. Greg better leave or I will have to beat him up. Luckily Greg left so I do not have to beat him up. I think my friends listen to more Korean music then I do. God I wish I could get off this computer but I have to stay on here for a while. The reason is because I have to study for my chemistry quiz tomorrow. Hopefully it will be easy because I do not know what is going on in that class. I need to go talk to the chemistry department about switching my chemistry teachers. Hopefully they will let me because I have no clue on what is going on. Today I ate some lunch around eleven o'clock. Yes the food was nasty because it was from Jester. I think they intentionally make the food here disgusting so that we will stop eating and study more. But I don't think so because everybody winds up either working out or playing basketball. I wish they would turn off this music because sound gay. Anyway when is this assignment going to end. I really need to go study for my chemistry class. I just need to type for about ten more minutes. I wonder who this song is by?  Then again why did I care it is stupid. I need to talk to someone but I lost their number so I guess I won't have my blanket.

‎     Damn if I didn't hit enter out of habit at fourteen minutes, submitted an incomplete, computers eat my soul, thinking though again on the great badmitten essay of 1999 in outdoor education, a gym coach that never read or listened to the students, known as fact, killed time by writing idiot descriptions of sporting history, history of badmitten, wrote mashed potatoes mashed potatoes mashed potatoes mashed potatoes filling my two pages, I got an A. I met my girlfriend in that class, thinking back to short, white hair and anonymous breasts, she was drunk on our first date, she'd been with many other partners, she smoked and was vulger and knew everything about kandinsky, I painted a portrait of her standing next to a giant anthropomorphic hot dog outside the kodak theater, the hot dog dabbed his own head with ketchup, like a chicken spokesman for a chicken store, a cow for cavender's, or a retarded inmate on death row for the republican party, moving on my dreams dr are a numb series of catastrophic violence, eating brains of my best friends and crying for the deaths of assholes, once fought jack nicholson in a sea of burning ember monkeys, died by the hand of an explosive ship painting, buried under the weight of fat men, my last trip to big bend found me at the base of a babble agave, watching silver linings to form concentric circles around the great javelina head, tusking my eyes out so we could share a nice moment alone at sea, crying in the arms of alien waifs, couldn't fall asleep til I beat tyson in my mind, I graduate in three months with classes outside my interests cause they told me I took too much too much so now you need to suck it up and finish with the freshmen who are there because they don't know where else to be well I know where I need to be and it's not around this keyboard spilling oil into the duck's mouth and making him chase it with a beer, my cat soon yi just came into the room, hopped into my lap staring at these words march across this screen down the page and out of my life.     ‎stream of consciousness‎0

‎     coming to ut has been a pretty crazy experience. my first week here i already felt like i was at home. it wasnt that way at the college i attended previously. that place took my two years to get comfortable. i think it has something to do with the fact that i have grown friendlier to most people. the one exception is my roommate drew. i don't know why we arent best friends, but i think it has a lot to do wiht the fact that we come from two entirely distinct backgrounds. he was the son of a cop, whos prents got divorced, and i was the son of a librarian, who parents always talked about getting divorced. also, here women seem to enjoy my preasance more, i think that has a lot to do with my radical overhaul of my diet and exercise routine. one girl in particular is named vanessa. she is an entirely charming girl, with a body to die for, but i don't know.  how do we trully know we found the right one, is it that divine spark that fills our soul thew first time we lay eyes on a person or is it a familiarity that stems from shared time with someone that eventually turns to amore?  unfortunantly i was cursed with finding love at frist sight with my fist girl friend. but being as young as we were, i cnat help but think what would hve happened if we would have met later. on this subject i have often wondered about my parents, i have a vague notion that theirs was a marraige of convience. i overheard one day that the last time they had sex was the night i was concieved?!?!!??! i don't now what that means, just came up. this i think is the point of life. the wondering, lust filled age we are in now, followed by silent impotent contemplation. no wonder why all people in power are old and white. they don't have the drive in their hearts to find romantic ideals the way youth does. in a sense i think i am an idealist. i like to see the glass as half full, but usually only with people i care about. this deals alot with social conciense. what a terrible thing to have. all of us who are educated are confronted evertday with the absurdities of our goals. i want to have a nice house and car for my family and i want to help the world. but would i accept lesser for those i love to compensate those i do not know?!?!?!  off course not, yet high minded individuals lambast me when they are doing the exact smae thing. so in the end what does one do, pursue their own intersts or bang ones head against the system. i think it has to be a mixure of the two. because the more one knows, the more one knows that nothing in this world is blakc and white. tragis heroes‎stream of consciousness‎0

‎I really wish people would be more efficient with their laundry. It annoys me to no extent when people don't keep up with it. Just a few minutes ago I was trying to wash my towels and I couldn't because the person left their clean, washed clothes in the washer. I felt bad taking the stuff out and leaving it around. It's not like I would of thrown it on the floor or anything, but I feel wierd picking someone else's clothes and underwear out of the machine. Well I built up the courage because I was annoyed and I then realized that the machine next to it, which was in use before, was now free. So I had a whole who-ha over nothing. Oh well. I actually love doing laundry for some strange reason. I love clean clothes that smell really good. I use dryer sheets and fabric softner so they smell extra yummy. I keep looking at the clock because I'm waiting for Road Rules to come on. They kicked this girl Ruthie off last time because she has an alcohol problem. I really don't think it solved the problem at all. Now she'll be even more inclined to do whatever she feels like. I guess I've never lived with or experienced alcoholism so I wouldn't know what it is like. Needless to say, Ruthie is extremely reluctant to go to rehab. She firmly believes that she is a strong enough person to do this on her own. Don't they all say that? Well I hope she gets better because I know it must be an extremely hard thing to overcome, especially by yourself. I think professional help is an extremely good thing and nothing to be ashamed of. I know many people who have had rough times and psychiatrists and psychologists are very helpful in overcoming depression, alcoholism, or whatever it may be. I know that a lot of celebrities go to shrinks. Rosie O'Donnell talks about it openly- about herself and with her guests too. She thinks it's a great thing. I think it's good that occasionally you can have someone who listens to you regardless and someone that you know will not judge you in any type of way. Although I am a firm believer of not having other people tell you what to think, I think this is totally different. These kind of people are trained and don't tell you how your mind works. I think they simply stimulate ideas, thoughts and reactions that allow one to think about things in different lights and more fully. Ok-enough about that. I've noticed that my roommate takes really long showers. I take mine in the morning and I'm in there for seriously about 2 or 3 minutes. Whereas she's in there for like 10 or so. I wonder why that is. I guess I'm in such a rush in the morning that I'm not going to stand there idely and have a think about my day. There doesn't seem to be enough time to do that now‎stream of consciousness‎0

‎I just got back from math class, and surprisingly, I feel good despite my lack of sleep for the past 2 weeks. Or I should probably say my irregular sleep patterns. But anyway, I'm not looking forward to my economics class, but my psychology class is a different story. I like my professor, he actually keeps the class interesting, as well as entertaining/comical, unlike my economics class. I dread that class every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, and I would not be surprised if I fell asleep in that class today. But there is one advantage to going to economics Salina, or should I say Natalie. I got to stop calling her Salina. I wonder if she gets offended. I hope she knows that I mean well, and besides, she's so cool. Not to mention, fine as all hell. I wonder what I'm going to do tonight, I hope I see Amy. Woooooohh deeee! She is the most gorgeous, absolute prettiest, hottest girl I have ever seen in my entire life, hands down, bar none. And yes, I am keeping Annie in mind. Annie would be a close second. I wonder how Annie is doing, I miss her. I should probably respond to her email, considering she did email me 2 WEEKS AGO! That's alright, I can just come up with another excuse, like always. That could be the problem with me. I just put things off and blame it on laziness. But I don't want to go into that right now, because I would need 20 different 20 min writing sessions. That sucks that I was just interrupted by my roommate's phone, because I was about to be on fire. I wonder how many words per minute I've been typing. Pretty good, I'm sure. It's surprising that I haven't mentioned Jared, or Dom I don't give an F about those guys anymore, and I wouldn't be one bit discouraged if I never saw them again. You better believe that. I could have hit those bastards, for the sake of keeping this writing assignment somewhat clean. Anyways, I believe that it will catch up to them someday, and I'm going to let Nature take it's course. I know for a fact that Miles doesn't have anything going for him, I mean he got fired from my friend's dad's restaurant, and then got fired from Subway! Not to knock Subway, but I would expect more out of him, or maybe not. Dom will somehow make an important person feel special, he'll win his or her respect and make a living out of it, but he'll never earn respect from anyone. Jared, I hate to admit, is smart, for now. But oh yeah, it'll catch up. All those drugs are going to bake his head, I can already see it happening. Sure, he's textbook smart, but that won't last for long. Usually, I would wish for their wellbeing, but I have been through far too much. Right now, I seem malicious towards them, but in 2 weeks, I'm sure I just won't care. Has‎stream of consciousness‎0

‎have some greater purpose in life. So many things interest me that I feel pressured in choosing what to follow through with. A friend of mine has the same problem and she said ?I feel like I have 10 souls inside of me and each wants to do a different thing. ? And I feel the same way! Ideally I just want to make a difference and help people. I'm sure that somewhere in the next four years I will figure out what I want to do. It makes me wonder how other people just automatically know what they want to do. Is it because they are really good at something and want to follow through with it, or is it just because they made a random decision and want to stick with it? Who knows! I have nothing to do all night which is the perfect chance to study, but for some reason I just can't concentrate. Maybe it's because I took a nap and now all I want to do is go back to sleep! For the first few weeks I was sleeping wonderfully, but I haven't been able to for the past few days. Maybe Pennebaker's talk about college kids having sleep problems affected me! I doubt it though. But it is great being in Psychology. Although the book can be a bit boring sometimes, some of the subjects are incredibly fascinating and I can relate to most of them! Michael laughs at me all the time because I am constantly trying to justify things in life by what I learn in psychology. He has a terrible memory, so when I learned about the hippocampus or the amygdala or whichever it was, I immediately thought of him. And of course he laughed at me and thought I was silly to think that he had a medical deficiency since he couldn't remember things well. Oh well I guess! At least he loves me! Well, I have one more minute and I don't know what I'm supposed to close this off with, but I guess that means I'm supposed to keep rambling on. I would be really interested in seeing what kind of study these are being used for, if any. I would love to see what people wrote about. Probably friends and school, which seems to be what mine is dominated by, but maybe not! ‎stream of consciousness‎0

I want to see regina's hair because she got it done today too it looks really cute and it has red in it and blonde and I think she looks good with it. Kevin called today and wants mom and dad, well everyone to put their money they're contributing for grandma and grangpa's thing in cash so they can give it to them in this game show thing. the lady who did our hair is like 50 something but looks a lot younger. like 35 or 40 - no lie. well the television was just turned on and was talking about football now something is on about a comedian. I like black people, they are so much fun to be around and they are not as uptight, well when it comes to their family I guess they are but not just in general. I like jz he's cool but I don't know I think that I like all kinds of music, not any kind in particular. sometimes I feel really left out because so many people know these alternative bands, but I don't because I don't really like the music as much as I like oh wow mija is getting a bath by laurie, yeah! other music like pop and rap. It's amazing how fast this time is going by like I thought it would take a lot longer or seem like I was typing a lot longer. I like that song and I can't believe a 14 year old sings it - jojo what kind of a name is that! I like the bangs I got cut, but I don't know if I am going to be able to fix it like this myself. Kyle is coming over later and I hope he likes my hair. and if he doesn't well it's not like I can do anything about it. I wish I was better at volleyball and could have done more with it.

I  forget what else oh yeah like old school punk with the snotty vocals well. anyways my dad got mad because I was supposed to help some guy move and I bailed halfway through to go play the show, playing live is like a drug, this time it wasnt so grreat, but weve playeed about 12 or 13 shows and some have been awesome, the crowd going insane because of us were aboutt o lose it any second just trying to hold on to our instruments long enbough to make the next note come out barely even able to keep our feet on the ground. anyways thats all over now because I have to get a job and go to college and theres no time for it ill find other ways to make myself feel good but that was a grweat one and I know my bandmates are depressed about it too. anyways my dad was mad because I did that and left even though I got the 40 bucks and so he's really mad and I don't even feel at home hre, at home asnd I don't feel completely at home in my dorm so I'm restless and it sucks. anyways so thats the whole of that messs and I'm just ttyping now because that whole thing was like one big brain sigh and now I'm breathing normal again. stop. nothing to say. maybe the brain works like that spasms of thought and then kind of a rest.

I have to go all the way back up to my apartment and get paper so that I can make a copy and print out the psych. notes. yeah no computer is really annoying. I�m thinking about what to write. what can I write that won�t be too ummmm what�s the word, I don�t know lol. I wonder if they�ll know what lol means. ha what a dork. yeah I don�t seem like a weirdo hmmmm. I think I�ll eat dinner after this. pot pies? hmmmm. oh wait pasta sounds really good right now and I have that ragu sauce in the fridge too. mmmmm. and then I can eat the Italian bread I got today with it too ah man I�m getting really hungry, lol. ah man, it�s only been 4 minutes. you know, time goes by a lot slower when your in athletics esp. track. Like you can run a lap in 6O sec. doesn�t sound like a lot of time but it really is. or lines in basketball. lines as in the ones you run. lol, that probably doesn�t make any sense if you don�t know what I�m talking about. there was something else I was thinking about writing too before going off on the athletic path. hmmmm. what was it something about time. ok I forget. ah man someone just interrupted me, they had a question about the printer, see what I mean about the no computer thing? Not having my own computer really stinks. So anyways. I think I�m going to work out tonight. I usually don�t like to run on the treadmill but the one at the apartment isn�t too bad. I think that�s because I can look out the window when I�m running lol, even as I�m typing this stuff I am thinking about totally different stuff than what I am typing. like when I was typing about the treadmill I was actually thinking about how my typing has gotten faster since I�ve been talking on instant messenger and that led me to think about how my roommate let�s me use her laptop sometimes so I don�t have to come down here, but her keyboard is a French keyboard and it�s really hard to type on because all the letters are switched. Ok, now my hand is starting to hurt well not the hand. more like that my forearm right below my elbow I fractured my thumb in fifth grade lol, that was out of nowhere well no, it was because I was thinking about my hand and then that led to my thumb.

‎As I sit here at my desk typing, all I can think about is how hot I am and how come our room is so unbelievably hot. I am under a lot of stress right now because I have so many pages to read and it takes me so long to read them since I have trouble focusing on them. By body is starting to sweat, maybe I should tell my RA to turn down the AC. I am really stressing over having to read biology, because, no matter how much I read it, I just can't comprehend what the book is saying. I'm sure I will struggle in biology this year. At first, I couldn't understand why you are making us do this, but now that I am doing this I understand the purpose behind it. This is really helping me to gather my thoughts and it is actually nice to express your feelings. My stomach feels extremely full because I just came from the Dobie cafeteria. I really wish I hadn't eaten so much junk food, I need to eat healthier. I am really regretting eating that ice cream, I have got to stop doing that. I also need to work out more. It all of a sudden just occurred to me that the reason I am so hot is because I am sunburned. When you're sunburned does your body just start letting of hot air or something? It is obviously clear that I am unfamiliar with the way my body works. I am dreading class tomorrow because I am so behind on my reading. I probably should be doing reading instead of doing this. Its funny how you find yourself doing anything just for the sake of avoiding the things you don't want to do. I only have to write for a few more minutes. I wonder what my test is going to be like in biology. If I take great notes and read, even if I don't comprehend it very well, will I still be able to do well on the tests? My elbow has just started throbbing because I scraped it water skiing earlier today. I really wish I wouldn't have fallen because it starts throbbing every time I extend my elbow. Oh great! Time's up. Talk to you later. katie ‎stream of consciousness‎0

‎"""The first thought that enters my mind is that I have no idea what I am going to say in this assignment. I have no thoughts or feelings except that I am trying to think about what to say. These types of assignments are difficult for me because I usually concentrate on a concrete task, not writing down random thoughts. Because I am a guy, sex just popped into my head. Because I am male, I hope I do not have to write down everytime this happens in the next nineteen minutes. For the next nineteen minutes, the only feelings I will have are those of confustion and befuddlement, for lack of anything to say. This being my first college writing assignment, I am a little nervous that I may be doing this wrong. I must change my previous statement that I am confused. It is more of a fear that I will do this assignment wrong and not receive credit for it. My next thought was to look at the clock and see how much time I had left. Only fourteen minutes left. Yahoo.   I just wondered if there was going to be a volleyball game at the gym tomorrow. It is not that I like volleyball, but that it takes away the gym at Gregory for playing basketball, which is my favorite thing to do on weeknights. (eleven minutes left. I can't wait). I just glanced back at the prompt and realized that it is impossible to not think about grammar, spelling, and sentence structure. This is not a warning usually associated with a writing assignment, and therefore it will probably be focused on more because of it. I just saw an empty Dr. Pepper can in the garbage can and I thought I might like one, but then I realized that I wanted to finish this assignment before getting one. My next thought was that I wish I had a thesaurus right now because I have used the word """"assignment"""" too many times. Excuse me, someone just knocked on the door. It was one of my roommate's friends who scares me because I believe he might go """"postal"""" at anytime. I had a thought before this person came to the door, but I forgot it now. It's okay because I only have to write for seven more minutes. I am wondering what my """"Quote of the Day"""" will be on my board outside my dorm. I want to use a quote from the movie """"What About Bob"""" but I'm afraid it will be too long to fit on the board. Again, I am having the problem of not knowing what to say. It must stem from my lack of self-esteem. I just glanced at the clock and found that I only have to write for two more minutes. I just realized that I should not have written that down because I could have stopped then and you wouldn't have known but now you will expect at least a few more sentences.

‎Well now I'm starting my writing assignment for psychology. Great, just another thing that's keeping me from doing everything else I have to do. I still have another chapter I have to read for biology, but I guess I can do that after calculus tomorrow, I'll have a good hour to get that in. And I'm sure professor weiss will end up assigning another chapter or two for the afternoon class. Is that my cell phone?  No, I thought I turned it off. Ya its off, it must have been my roommate's cell phone. Man the awkward silence in this dorm room is deafening. I really wish I would have just sprung for the single room. But no, mom said that wouldn't give me the ?college experience?. blah blah blah. All the experience I'm getting out of this is to avoid being in the dorm room. My light bulb on this lamp I bought isn't very good, it does not give off much light, but when you turn it a certain way you start to go blind, it just does not make any sense. And I don't know who the architect was behind putting these dang bookshelves in Jester. There is not enough room for my computer monitor to be pushed to the back of my desk. and I have a flat panel monitor so that is saying something. I mean I have no space for my books, spirals, paper or anything with the addition of my keyboard and mouse. Its just ridiculous. Even if computers hadn't been invented way back when this place was built, it still makes no logical sense to have the book case as low as it is without completely attaching it to the desk. I mean, they might as well have just added 2 more shelves to the darn thing and called it quits. Nothing could fit back there, its just aggravating. Wow its only been 6. 5 minutes, I've got a long ways to go. I have to do my calculus homework after this, I hope that goes well. The last thing I need is to stress out over some retarded math problem and end up having it been typed wrong so there is no solution and you spend your entire night trying to figure it out when there is no solution available in the choices that logically fits into the problem. That is the thing I hate about multiple choice math problems, anybody can leave off a negative sign and leave you chasing your tail forever. I really wish I would have just waited to take m408l, I already had C out of the way, but I didn't want to wait and have all the stuff I learned in high school leave my brain and be totally lost when it came time to take the class. Plus I kind of like the mathematical stimulation, its totally different than any other kind of study. When you understand a math concept, you really feel accomplished with yourself.

I think the purpose of a sorority must be not so much to give you a place as a freshman, whichis nice and it does do, but it makes a small close world for you of very cool poeople when you are a sopjomore and a junior. I don't know how much I would want to be conected to the sorority my senior year, but just the girls and the people I had met from being a part of it. it think  it would be somewhat like cheerleading was, where by your junior and esp senior year you aren't really interested int he younger girls, and you really do your own thing. but that owould be awesome anyway because at that point hopefully I;ll be absorbed into my new life and begining a career.

‎"""It is 4:07 and I am supposed to be in psychology right now. When I got out of class at 3 I just walked to the bus and came home. Then at 4 I realized that I had skipped class. I have no idea how I could do that without even realizing it. My mind is working too fast and I am too focused on other things. Maybe starting Adderral again yesterday had some effect. It speeds up my thoughts rather than focusing them on the matter at hand. Now I'm not sure if that is going to be as helpful to me with school as it will be harmful. My apartment is too quiet. I just wrote to Coody and asked him to play a Modest Mouse song next time. He won't. That would be too weird for everyone. I would have volunteered to be class dj if I thought everyone wouldn't hate it and glare at me. I was also afraid my cd's would skip. They're all scratched. I can't believe I missed class, especially by accident. I feel ridiculous. Especially since I don't know anyone in the class to get notes from. Or I probably do but I don't know it because there are 500 people in there. I wonder. It has only been 4 minutes and 16 seconds, this feels a lot longer than I thought it would. I'm writing a lot more than I thought I could. Friendster is improving my typing, that's a depressing thought. I need to get off the internet and study. I need to study the Jeffersonian idea, how interesting. I think if I could go back and stop the manufacturing and the advance of technology I would. It would be so nice to live off my own land, to be self-sufficient. I wish I could have started that way, because I'm too selfish to give it all up now. It would be impossible as well. The world doesn't leave room for that anymore. Anti-Flag sang about the kid saying, If you hate America so much, why don't you move to Russia?!"""" Ignorance is funny. My foot itches. I have a doctor's appointment tomorrow morning after philosophy. I really don't want to go. Or I wish there was no reason for me to go. I am never healthy for more than a week straight. There is always something wrong, something to deal with, worry about, or panic over. I am so tired of that. 8 minutes and 22 seconds, almost half way. This is very strange. I haven't done this since 7th grade. Then it wasn't for 20 minutes and it was more like """"poetic"""" rambling, not full sentences. This is strange because my mind is going way faster than my fingers. My typing is not good. I never learned to keep my fingers on the """"home keys"""", and for that Mrs. somebody smacked me on the head with her rolled up papers. That was special. Now I am halfway through.

‎We went to Barton Springs today as a sorority, and met a bunch of my new pledge sisters. I just pledged Zeta Tau Alpha, and I absolutely love it. Today, we layed out beside the pool, which really has lake water in it,and I nearly fell asleep. When I put my feet in the water, it felt like I had just breaken through the top layer of Ice, and now my feet are in the water below it, like a pond that had been frozen over. It was really neat to see the different type of people that will soon become some of my best friends. Hopefully I will have gotten a tan. Yesterday, I went to the football game and met my boyfriend and his family there. He lives in Dallas and is a senior in high school. His brother is one of the starters on  the football team, so it was really neat to see him play. I sat with my boyfriend and his family, which I hadnt seen in a while. Later on that night we went to his brother's apartment and hung out. I was so happy to have seen my boyfriend. He's an incredible guy. Anyways, I could go on forever. My feet really hurt today from these little pieces of wood that were on the ground, and when I walked around with no shoes, it did not feel good. Right now, I am looking around my room and it looks so much different than it did a week ago, when I had not yet pledged a sorority. Everything I have now is zeta stuff. It really is kind of neat. I love being in a sorority. It's really a good chance to meet people and feel a sense of family even when you are away from family. Speaking of family, I really miss my family. My parents are divorced, and my dad lives in Massachuttes. My mom lives in Dallas with my two younger brothers. They miss me so much. Especially my dog, who uses the bathroom all over the house just to show us when he is mad or upset with us. My mom said that lately he has been doing that. I guess its because I left him. I always would play with him, such as throwing a frisbee and play tug-o-war. He was so attached to me it was unbelievable. Everywhere that I went in the house, he would follow. I love dogs. I can't wait to go home and see all of them. My brothers really miss me also. They don't have an older sister to boss them around anymore. My mom really misses me too. I was the only daughter, so she was very attached to me. She calls me about 5 times a day, and emails about 3. I guess as time passes by, she will get used to me being gone, but right now I don't think that she has adjusted very well. But I guess that goes for all moms when their children go off to‎stream of consciousness‎0

‎"""WOW!  Time goes by fast. Here I am doing my college homework and it seems as  though just the other day I was at recess or eating from my lunchbox in  elementary school or going through the trials of junior high or thinking you  know everything in high school to realizing you don't know everything in  college. Time flies and friends come and go. I have met so many people since I  have been at this enormous school. I have come to realize that you must take  initiative in order to succeed. For instance, I am currently majoring in  theatre, but I don't know if that's what I really want to do with my life. If I  don't get out there to take initiative to try out and see how far I can go, I  will never figure out if theatre is the way I want to go or not. Then there's  the question of what I'd do if I didn't major in theatre. I know that I  wouldn't do anything with computers because this is the 3rd time I've had to  write this since I have had many computer troubles. I accidently erased the  first one and my friend's computer froze when I was writing the other one. I am  using my friend Robert's computer because mine won't connect to the internet. Right now I'm sitting in a room with some of my new friends from UT, and they're  talking about Ross's hair. Some of the girls want to cut his hair, but he  doesn't want his hair cut. They think it looks like an 80s haircut but he begs  to differ. Anyway, back to the other thoughts of the past, present, and future. I just remembered that I have a blueberry muffin sitting on the shelf in my  room. I hope it's not stale. Maybe I can drink it with my over-do milk. It's  past the drinking date. This gum is very stale and I am getting hungry. If I  were in my room, I would eat my muffin or the chips that I didn't eat last week  because I had to get to class. You see, I feed the birds my second sandwich  because I'm full. Then I still have chips left over. Oh, well. The joys of  wednesday sack lunches from Towers. I'm used to sack lunches because I've eaten  a sack lunch every day in high school. The reason is that we eat in the  greenroom and it's hard to get your tray into the greenroom. Some of my friends  have done it, but then they put the trays up above the ceiling and the teachers  get mad. Ah, the good old days. Robert and Ross and Kristi want to order a  pizza. That sounds like a good idea. It's late and I have to get up early for  my intro to media class tomorrow. College‎stream of consciousness‎0

‎I cannot believe that I am actually writing and doing my assignment on a Saturday. I am actually right now in a friend's apartment and trying to talk to a friend before this assignment writing, and I got nowhere with my friend. I feel so bad for my friend, Jimmy. He is so depressed, but he won't even talk to me. I feel like I should be there to help him out, but he won't say anything. I guess that I should talk about myself and not about other people, but I am just so worried about him. I have been so extremely busy today. I woke up at 7 this morning. And I had to go to a BASIC meeting, which I am very involved in. I just happened to be 2 minutes late, and now I have to do something very humiliating in front of everyone next Friday. I guess I don't mind if I do it to learn not to be late anymore. Then I had to go see my cousin and his wife for lunch. I didn't want to go, but I felt compelled to go in order to show support for my cousins since he is a pastor of a new church. I am glad that I went because they are my family and they helped to support me when I needed them most. Actually, my friend Jimmy, which I just mentioned earlier, totally bailed on me when I asked him to help me move b/c he had a truck. I asked way in advance, and I called him the night before, and I even told him that he could back  out and I wouldn't even mind. He actually said to my face I don't want to do it when I had driven all the way from Houston to Austin. I couldn't believe that he had said that! I was so mad! I mean for someone to make a promise and then say no really hurt my feelings. Then he said he would help, but only when he called an hour later. I got prideful, and I said that I would take care of it myself. Then I realized my pridefulness, and I prayed to God to break me down. He definitely showed me how I need to be more patient these days. I then called him back later and asked to borrow his truck if one of our mutual friends would drive the truck. Our mutual friend had before, but Jimmy somehow didn't want him to do that for some extremely strange and bizarre reason. it wasn't as if our friend hadn't driven his car before. I don't know. I then thought about and then prayed some more, and then I realized how he was nice enough to help me, even though he couldn't follow through with his promise. I went to California on vacation, and I had bought him a key chain b/c I knew how stressed he was. I put a little letter of apology, but he didn't even thank me for‎stream of consciousness‎0

‎. It's amazing how much my mood differs by my surroundings or situations. Currently I'm ecstatic because I just found out that my soccer team may be going to Clemson College and that is where my best friend, Kristen McKinney is going to school. I miss her SO much! When I think of her I never have any bitterness or resentment in my heart, but rather gratitude that God brought her into my life. With my constantly shifting moods and feelings, she was always a pillar of strength and stability, the most loyal friend I have ever had. I had so much trust in her, that many times I found myself dependent on her when I needed a listening ear or a shoulder to cry on. I remember a time when I was at my other best friends house and we had a discouraging talk about how I felt her boyfriend was consuming her life. Immediately after I left I drove two blocks to Kristen's house and there she was ready to listen and pray with me. People say that the deep friendships are formed in college, but I know that the friendship Kristen and I have can't get much more intimate than ours. Through out high school we ran cross country and had classes together, therefore we knew every event happening in each other's lives. That's why it's so hard not having her here with me to share the experience of college with. Although I miss her dearly, self pity will not consume me because I am confident that God has prosperous plans for me at UT and Kristen at Clemson. Also this will each me to become completely dependent on Christ and His promises and not on fleeting things of this world. I really hope that I will not become hardened by the sin that is in me and surrounds me daily. Already I find myself not making time to be in the Word, which is the armor I need to remain strong against the enemy. I can relate with Paul who can't understand why he does the very things he despises. But glory be to God who makes me free of guilt through Jesus. Why He chose me, I have no idea. My mind can only take so much of seriousness, then it wanders back to funny Chris Farly lines or petty worries of the day. Already I am thinking of other assignments I need to complete after this and of how I need to get in touch with certain people. Yet we are suppose to live our lives a prayer to God, and I have such trouble letting Christ shine out of me when I am running errands, or standing in lines, or in class. Lord, please make me a bondservant to serve You daily on this campus or where ever I am and who ever I run into. ‎stream of consciousness‎0

‎right now. There are just parts of me that could be smaller. And I'm too lazy to work out, so not eating will solve all of these problem areas. I'll be the anorexic that always eats Milky Way. Because those are so good and I could never give them up. When do I become an adult? I have no clue where that came from. But really. When? It's really quiet in here. I can hear Natalie typing on occasion. She is a good student. Always on top of things. Our room smells like new carpet when you first walk in. The other day it smelled like Clam Chowder. Not pleasant. I miss my family. I never thought I would. I don't miss them so much that I'd cry or be terribly homesick. I mainly miss the meals. And the fact that if I was sick they would go and buy me what I needed. I took birth control for the first time on Friday and it made me sick and there was no one to take care of me. It made me appreciate my mom so much more, which I rarely do. Yes, I am a spoiled brat. I didn't get as much stuff as other brats did, but I am one nonetheless. And I have no concept of money because I am willing to shell out another couple hundred bucks in October to go see Eric again. And my mom will be furious at me if she finds out. I'm not going to tell her this time. I'll give Natalie all the information. And pray my parents don't come down for a surprise visit. I like our dorm room. It has a lot of character. I love our posters. Natalie and I have the same tastes in a lot of things. Of course, I'd much rather have my best friend Monica as a roommate. I miss her so much. And with her, I do miss her to tears. She is the only one I could be myself around. I love her so much. And feel horrible about what I did to her last year. I blew her off. I wasn't a good friend. And I'll never forgive myself for it. The girls across the hall from us just got home. I don't like them that much. Jenny is nice. She listens to Morrissey. And, however stereotypical that is, we think she is gay because of that. Most Morrissey girls are lesbians. And Paige, the other girl, is really stuck-up. And she listens to lots of local bands from Dallas that I despise. So yes. It takes a lot for me to warm-up to people. I'm very selective with friends. Which I shouldn't be because I'm not the coolest person to hang out with. And boy do I have low self-esteem. I constantly put myself down. Eric gets annoyed with it. And I type really hard, too. I think Natalie is annoyed with this sound right now. Oh well. Seriously, is someone going to read this? Is there a right or‎stream of consciousness‎0

For example, one guy had a growing voodoo doll attacking him, one lady had a psychologist (haha) using hypnotism to control her and several other people, giving them bizarre fears (hers was of herself, one guy had a look-alike twin of his out to kill him. just weird stuff. So on the way of fixing the problem, the main character always falls in love with some stranger they meet along their journey, or they fall even more in love with their present spouse. and it ALWAYS ends happy. Therefore I no longer read Dean Koontz books. I know what is going to happen after I have read the first chapter.

And you don't really notice the big classes.

‎     Well, apparently i'm supposed to just type for 20 minutes.  Being that it is September 11, i suppose it would a good topic. Everywhere i look i see something about 9/11. Even the clock at UT is stopped at 7:46. All of the television stations are going on and on about many things dealing with 9/11.         The first thing i did this morning was turn on the television, almost like i did so mechanically for a month after 9/11. Why?  So i can see if we have been attacked or if we are now attacking someone else. It's almost a sense of deja vous or something. (i don't speak french). I really hate seeing all of these images of the towers though. I sometimes wonder what would have happened if the towers hadn't collapsed. Would everyone be okay less 500 people?            I'm really ready to see us attack Iraq. Iraq is just a big problem. I've always carried myself with little opinion because why should I, ME, say whether we should take military action or not or whatever the case may be. I don't know much, all I know is what the news tells me. How can anyone say we shouldn't attack Iraq?  If we do, I am confident that it was the right thing to do. People just need to accept that we are living a naive life when it comes to terrorism and if we knew what the people that make the calls do, we'd probably say the same thing.           These new   What if America wasn't America?   commercials are really fascinating. I find them very effective. I mean, a man goes to the library, and wants to find some books, it doesn't even matter the topic, and he finds out the books have been abolished and then he gets arrested. I never really thought about that. I mean, I can go to the library, pick up a book on atomic bombs, check it out, and no one asks a word. It's just a liberty that we have that remains unquestioned. That's pretty cool.             Actually, my favorite commercial related to 9/11 is the one where they show an building or an apartment area or condos or whatever they are, and they say:   Terrorists goal is to change the way of life of America   or something like that, and then it shows the next day US flags hung all over the building and says   they succeeded.   That is just a cool commercial. I remember when there used to be flags EVERYWHERE. Now you're lucky if you ever see them. I guess that's not natural to be so patriotic.

I think I am going off the page now so I will press return okay, that line was probably fucked up but that's okay. I wonder how long it will take to get on a computer tomorrow. It didn't take too awfully long today. I used to be able to type faster than this, I think. I  am out of practice from summer. I can't write as well, either. not that I was very good to begin with. This is going to seem like a really long time. I was going to say take a long time, but it's only twenty minutes, which doesn't seem like that long in theory, but it really is. I am not looking at the screen and my writing is going everywhere. I wonder what the other people said, and if they noticed that this thing doesn't automatically scroll down as you type. It's good to do this on the internet because it saves a lot of paper waste, but it's annoying to have to come here and wait for a computer when I�m used to just writing things on paper at home. I wonder if Jonathan had emailed me yet-- I will check on that after I finish this thing. Doh!- It's only 4:16. I have a really long time. I wonder if he can tell whether or not people cheat and cut it short. if you can type really fast then you can get a lot done. I wonder how fast I type in comparison with everyone else. I should have learned how to touch type before I came to college. I still use the hunt and peck version staring at the keyboard. It's hard to do that when you're transcribing a paper or something that you aren't thinking of as you go. I'm getting tired. This reminds me of the simpsons when grandpa is rambling on and on and nobody is listening or cares what he says. """"ewww. what smells like mustard?"""". I love that show. I can't wait until the new season starts. I wonder if we'll win the Simpson�s house that would solve all our problems for the rest of our lives. never having to do what we don't want to do. But it would be annoying to live in. I think you can tell a lot about a person by knowing  to what degree he or she likes the simpsons. Some idiots like my dad just think it's a cartoon, but it's really so much more. I should really finish that chapter that I didn't read. It was interesting enough, I just didn't have very much time to read. oh, I forgot some of my books, and I don't want to walk all the way to the dobie to get them. it's so hot!

‎     yeah so i really don't want to be doing this but oh well. i really actually enjoy the psych class though sometimes i wonder how exactly anyone can figure out what a person is thinking. who came up with those experiments in the first place. im so relaxed right now cause i just got back from having a one hour massage. it was kind of weird at first cause i had never had one before but after like 10 min i was asleep. i so needed a massage, and i always seem to be tired even though i feel i get plenty of sleep. i don't think im typing as fast as i should be because there is this little voice saying you mispelled a word, go back and correct it. i guess that means i don't know if im actually completing the exercise correctly. but he never did list whether things had to be grammarically correct. i feel that im like this never ending jutebox that won't stop talking. right now im typing like those really annoying people that you never want to listen to that you are just like SHUT UP. haha. yeah so i have alot of stuff on my mind lately. i would like to actually call this my vent session because i have all this stuff in my mind thats just really been bugging me and i can't tell anyone because my best friend is so far up my roommates butt, because they are boyfriend and girlfriend, that i can say how i REALLY feel. my roommate can be such a jerk sometimes. and he does the stupidest things that just totally piss me off. like this one time i got back home from houston and he was like its your turn to buy the groceries. but i was the one that bought eighty-eight dollars in food when he only bought thirty. he was like well I've finally caught up with you now and I've spent one hundred and eighty. and im thinking, well jeez im sorry to put you out but i barely ever eat. i swear he eats like there is no tomorrow and i think that I've narrowed it down to how many times he eats a day. like 5!  it just really pisses me off. and he tells ME how i do nothing. im not the one who has tuesday and thursday off. not only that he sleep all freakin day. hes SO LAZY. i just want to say to him, hey im not the one that spends 50 freakin dollars on the lunch meat you pick out and watch them cut. come on and give me a freakin break. on top of the whole grocery issue, my parents have ME on a strict budget and so i can't spend all that much money. he goes out and buys a three hundred dollar tv because he feels like it. what can you say to that. his dad is working his butt off to pay for all‎stream of consciousness‎0
‎"""Well, first I'm thinking about what to write about because this is probably the weirdest writing assignment I have ever been given. I'd like to write about my boyfriend, whom I'm very in love with, but I really do not think that that would be appropriate for this writing assignment. My roommate just left to go to her pledge party, and I really wish I was hanging out with her rather than doing this assignment about a week and half before it is due, but I guess it is better to do it now than to wait till last minute. Which is what I am going to try to do in all my classes, not wait until last minute to do all the stuff that I have to do!  I think that if I can just do that then I will be able to keep with all of my work and get grades in my classes that I will approve. I also need to get into the college of communications so therefore I HAVE to keep my grades up. I really can't wait to become a speech pathologist, I'm very excited about that. Also, God willing I really do think it would be awesome to go to the University of Iowa for their graduate program in speech pathology. They have the best in the nation, and plus ryan goes there. and if I'm going to marry him then being in the same place as him would be a huge plus!  Ok, dee you are completely wondering around here and I'm sure whoever reads this is going think that I am a weirdo, but I really don't have much else to talk about. Hmmm. I am excited about going home this weekend and seeing not only my parents and brother but the rest of my entire family!  I think we will have a lot of fun and I'm excited that I get to leave tomorrow to go home and don't have to wait until friday. I'm having loss of words at the moment. And someone just imed me. uhh oh, have to tell him to hold on!  Ok I did. lets get back on track here. I'M curious as to who gets to read these because I bet that would be a lot of fun. I'm sure that there are LOTS of different things said on each persons assignment. Gosh only 8 minutes of typing! Is this ever going to end!  (hey I'm being honesty here!)  I bet other people are making this a lot more amusing than I am, but I really am typing my thoughts and feelings. Actually I'm typing the first thing that pops into my head, which is probably why this is making NO sense at all. I think that sitting here and typing out what I'm thinking is distracting me from thinking about what I would really be thinking about, because I'm trying to find something to think about that I can type about.

‎My dad and I are trying to reconnect our computer and get the internet back on it and he is driving me crazy. He insults my intelligence and thinks I never know what I am talking about. This really makes me upset and hurts my feelings to the point I just feel like breaking down into tears. I am also stressed out about school this semester. I am on probation right now because my GPA fell below 2. 0. I am really trying to keep up this semester and bring it up but it is really stressing me out. Sometimes I just feel like giving up on everything but I know that will not solve anything. My life just feels so empty right now. To start off with I get in a bad car accident a few months before I graduate high school and then get a really crappy job for the summer. Then I end up on probation at the end of my first year at UT and I still have the same crappy job for the summer. Then I also have to take a summer course at ACC along with my crappy job. Then I have to have surgery which put me out of commission for half of the summer. The next thing I know my boyfriend and I are separating after a year and a half. Now I am back at UT struggling to keep up and improve my grades. My life just seems to be going down the drain right now and I seem to be following close behind. Though I enjoy my classes this semester I feel I am going to fall behind and I will end up need major help to get through it all. I just wish I had enough motivation to follow through with my studies and just blow everyone out of the water with my grades this semester. I wish now that I hadn't put this assignment off so long because now I have to be all the way out here on campus instead of at home studying. You know if I don't get off probation I am afraid my parents or the school will take me out and I will end up at ACC permanently. Getting a degree from ACC is not the best thing in the world you know. It is almost like getting a GED from high school because you had to go to ATLAS or something to that effect. ‎stream of consciousness‎0

‎My mind is pretty tired right now, but I can't get it off of having a good dark cup of coffee. I have gotten all of my work for this week done already so I'm at ease about that. Whenever I type I have to look at the keyboard so it kind of pisses me off. Now I'll let my mind wonder, I sometimes think of home and all of my trashed out friends there. Have you ever wished you could help a person you care about a lot, and they just won't listen to you? Well my friends back home have been doing drugs heavily for a while and I cannot do anything about it. In a time where controversy and sex sell the theme, it's hard to decide which is the winning team. There are just some things in life we can't understand, like why in the hell we can fight over land. I think we all need a helping hand, so we can rise together and make a stand. At a time perfectly linked to your transition can you even tell me your position? No because 90% of us don't even listen and make the right choice for our provisions. I see a new generation with many faces. Bringing together people from many different places. I think discrimination is in our past, but I do not know how long that thought will last. It is a society we ourselves cast, and sometimes it seems like a supernatural blast. To think of all our generations drugs, hell I myself have been associated with thugs. But still we have a consensual love, and I don't even think it comes from above. My thoughts and feelings always rhyme so prepare yourself because it's my time. Fuck all of the bullshit and fabrication, for we are the ones who'll shape this great nation. So I do have a proclamation What do we do without an education and occupation? In a time when money and power mean everything, how in the hell do the bells of freedom ring? Sometimes I wonder about our future in store, and if we'll still neglect the poor. We have so many people locked in cells, it's almost as if we're under a spell. Cast by our so called forefathers, and I seem to be the only one it bothers. For evolution will always take its toll, look back at how we burned the totem pole. Who will burn us and how will we know? Until we're allowed to run our own show. Everyone is so quick to judge, and even quicker to hold a grudge. Just because we all have different views, doesn't mean we cannot find a use. So even though this shit won't sell, when will we wake up and demolish this hell? Our constitution is all of our rights, but it is changed everyday in the supreme court lights. Who are they to decide the meaning? I think we all see to which side it's leaning. Leaning towards more control over us, I think‎stream of consciousness‎0

I was glad to see everyone thats in san antonio again and javi who is still at home and hating it. but who can blame the guy, weslaco isn't exactly the place one would want to be. I just feel bad for junior, he feels totally alone and stuff. javi and him are the only two who are still at home and all, but junior never talks to javi because he doesn't like what javi does on his spare time, so because of that, he doesn't talk to him as much. I was just glad he called on davids birthday to wish him a happy birthday and to talk, I miss that guy a lot, I just wish hed get off of his lazy ass and do something. he isn't working or going to school, hes just at home feeling sorry for himself and ballooning. all I could tell him is that he needed to do something to occupy himself and to not just sit thete and feel sorry for himself. hopefully he'll be here in austin visiting soon. speaking of getting off your ass, I need to get on the ball and stop procrastinating. high school might have been somewhat of a breeze through (a walk in the park) but college isn't the same, needless to say. dad said this is the rest of my life I'm preparing for, and there isn't a day that goes by that I don't say that quote to myself at least a hundred times because I'm being lazy. I miss dad, and mom and everyone else. yea we all hate eachother and get at eachothers throats but thats why we're family, only we can talk to eachother the way we do and get away with it. much like me and my friends, because friends are family too, even knowing more about you than you might through observation. regardless, I love austin, its a great town, there is so much to do, and a lot of time to do it in, but with all this free time you need to do it in moderation, because too much of a good thing can be bad for you. I hope grandma is ok, I miss waking up and telling her """"buenos dias, como manecio"""" and her being amazed that I'm even at home and even more amazed at the time it is that I wake up. I just hope nothing happens to her. I feel sorry for mel and all the trauma that she is probably feeling. she just had a kid, her husband is being accused of something we are all sure that he had nothing to do with, and the damn police with their false accusations the they are giving her, as well as the threats, in order to get her to tell them the information they believe she has, but which in fact she doesn't. because no matter how bad the news, she would come to my family first and let us know before her own mother‎stream of consciousness‎0

‎I'm a little worried these past few days because of the work study award. I know that I have a certain time limit to get a job and I'm trying to get a job but it's so hard. It's even harder when you've never had a job experience before. And my older sister keeps pestering me about getting a job. I know what I need to do, she just needs to lay off of me sometimes. That's one of the bad things about sharing a dorm room with a sister, she'll be able to spy on you and tell on our parents what's going on in my life. It's not always bad because I don't do anything that will disappoint my parents. The other thing that makes me a little mad is just because she is older than me, she can boss me around. It's not like I'm her slave or anything; it's just that I don't like the feeling of being told what to do and when to do it. I like being my own person, making my own decisions. If only I had been able to do that since I was a kid so I wouldn't have so much problems now. Ever since I could remember, my parents have always wanted me to become a doctor. Any doctor is ok as long as I made it. Well, what they want has followed me into my college life. The only reason why I would want to become a doctor is because my parents insist on me being one. So now I don't really know what I want to major in. I had never been given the chance to really consider my career because it has always been what my parents want. I'm just so obedient. I don't know why but I'm just like Ella in Ella Enchanted. Always obeying what others says. So, my college life has been ok so far. I like the campus a lot and I also like Jester because it's in the center of everything that I need. The PCL is across the street, and the gym is adjacent to it also. The food is right down on the 2nd floor of Jester or downstairs at JCL. Very convenient. The only bad thing about it so far is that I have a TV and that means trouble. I have become addicted to the show Three's Company. I have to watch it everyday. Let's see. It comes on ch. 40 at 10-11pm, ch. 41 at 12-12:30am, ch. 49 at 1-2am. So I stay up late just to watch my Three's Company. I know it's very silly especially since on Monday's, Wednesday's, and Friday's I have a 8am class. But somehow I manage to get up and not feel tired at all. Amazing isn't it?  But it probably will wear off soon. Another thing I have to mention, I am getting very tired of eating American food for every meal, I need something from my culture. I need my rice!

‎After my first week at the University of Texas, my mind is filled with a mixture of thoughts and emotions. On one hand, I am excited about starting at a new school and the opportunities that await me. However, I also worry whether I'll be able to balance the social aspect of my life with the challenges of school. First and foremost in my mind presently is pledgeship, which is drawing constantly nearer. What am I going to have to do? How am I going to be able to stay at the house all night and do others' chores and keep a good GPA? It will surely be difficult, but I am fairly confident I can do it. I have always been successful at overcoming challenges in my life. The hardships of pledgeship combined with the rigors of being in the business honors program should make for a busy semester, to say the least. I feel a great amount of pressure to perform. I have to make at least a 3. 5 to stay in the BHP, and 3. 25 to keep my scholarship money. This is the root of the nervous feelings within me. There is also a great deal to be excited about this semester also. I am excited about the experiences I will have, the people I will meet, and the friends I will make. This semester will be unlike any other I've had in my life. Thinking of the times I've had in the past 9 days since I arrived here makes me certain I chose a great school to attend. The BHP will offer me incredible future opportunities, and the friendships I forge with my pledge brothers will last a lifetime. I still can't believe that I'm already in college and moved away from home. I will face a great number of challenges this semester, but I am excited about them and overcoming these challenges will make this semester all the more rewarding. ‎stream of consciousness‎0
‎my school back home I   know everyone. i am the funny loud girl ! Here though I am all quiet. I   wonder why? It might be that I have known the people at home for a   long time , so I am comfortable around them enough to be crazy and   be be me. Here though I don't know any one and I think i actually   smile less. Is that normal ? I hope so or not . It really doesn't matter   since that is just the way it is . I keep thinking about this boy too. I   guess I'll write about it. i have been trying not to think of him, but I   can't help it so here it goes. There is a guy here that is like eight   years older than me who is from my town. He is like best friends   with my cousin, Will. They both decided to come to UT, but Will has   already finished and Jobie hasn't. Oh my I said his name and I hope   no one sees this. This is kind of like a journal which is weird to me.  If people read my real journal they would think I was crazy because I   only write in it when I am mad usually. I write sometimes when I am   sad or happy, but I usually write or draw when I am mad. i was mad   at my ex boyfriend one time and I drew this crazy picture. He saw it   and said the person on it all beat up was probably him. He was   trying to be smart to one of his friends or funny. Whatever he thinks   he is. Sometimes I wonder if I still like him a bit even though I   should not because he is a liar and a cheater. We used to be best   friends before we went out. Don't ever date your best friend because   it always ends up bad. I thought he wouldn't cheat on me even   though he has cheated on other girls. i thought he wouldn't because   he would have respect for me. i think it is funny that every time I write   the word respect that I have to sing the song to get it right. Oh well I   guess he didn't have any respect for me though because he did.  That is wierd that I can still get mad about this and it has almost   been a year since we broke up.

‎The timer is already on 15 seconds and I was thinking what to write. I am waiting for my boyfriend Nathan to call me because we just talked and he beeped over and said he'd call back. The fan in my room is seriously getting on my nerves because I stripped something in it and it makes a funny vibrating noise. I guess I am nervous about writing this because my foot will not stop tapping. I am so tired. I do not want to go to my Nutrition class today. It's the same thing every day and it lasts for an hour and a half. I have so much homework to do also. I just found out that my e-mail in the UT Directory is wrong and I have no idea who to contact to change that either. My eyes are drooping so bad. I have so much to do today and just not enough time. I need to finish all my homework, go to class, go to the gym, take a shower before class, and after I go to the gym, and then read a book for my classical mythology class. I'm looking at the timer now and it is only on 3 minutes and 47 seconds. It feels like I've been writing for a lot longer already. I guess I should be lucky to even be on the Internet. My dorm, (Dobie), has had a lot of problems with Ethernet, and this morning (for the second time) when I awoke, my Internet would not work. It really sucked. My room is so dirty and I need to clean it. I hate making my bed and waking up to start another long day. My stomach hurts because I ate too much at lunch. The food wasn't really that great today either. I shouldn't have eaten any ice cream. I need to start eating a lot healthier than I have been. I feel bad that I have been cheating on my diet. It was a protein/no carbs diet and at first I did well, but lately I've been cheating. I need to go to Wal-Mart today to buy a friend of mine a wedding present. I can't beleive she's getting married. I'll probably be the last of my friends to get married. Three of the 5 of us are already married. My eyes are soooo tired. I just want to crawl back in bed. I really really wish today were Friday. I can't even imagine what next week will be like. after all, the past two weeks have been short weeks. Next week is our first full week. I am so ready for this weekend. I am going home and sleeping in my own bed finally. The phone is ringing. It is my boyfriend, Nathan. I'm explaining to him that I have to get off the phone because I am doing this assignment. Okay he is gone now. I told him to call me back in ten minutes and he said he'd call me back in a little while. that‎stream of consciousness‎0

‎I think that I am a pretty friendly guy who is fun to hang with but no one ever calls me. I don't know if its because I get decent grades and look studious that they figure that I won't want to do anything or if its just because they don't like me and they are just pretending to like me. I used to think that I had good judgement of people but after finding out that all my friends in high school basically used me in class and ignored me outside of class, I have questioned in from then on. My quest to find a good group of reliable friends always seems to come to a dead end. I look at both of my sisters who are always getting calls from their classmates and friends and I never get any. They don't help much either because they are always reminding about the fact that I have no friends. I know people and I say hi to them in the hallways and class and they talk to me normally in class but outside of class I have no touch with them. I admit that I have done the best of job of keeping in touch with anyone, but I've started to this year but with no results so far. I always end up doing the calling and asking what people are up to. No one ever calls me. It just makes me mad. While people are complaining about all the junk mail and excess mail they get, I basically hoping or looking forward to getting one message per day. Lately, I think I'm so obsessed with it that I religiously check my e-mail hoping that something new happened. Other than that everything so far is going well. I've already joined a couple of clubs, got some leadership positions and will be volunteering. My resume is starting to shape up. Now if only my grades would follow, a decent grade on the MCAT would give me an excellent chance of getting into a decent medical school. Before none of these things bothered me before, even in high school. Just like in high school I see other people doing things and never cared that I never did. But once I came to college, it just started bothering me. I don't know if its my sister's influence or what its become a problem that last year kept me from doing good in my classes. Whether its same or not this year, I'm not going to let it ruin my grades. I hope to get a 4. 0 from now till I graduate. I tried talking to people, opening up about my problems and things like that because some people told me that I was to closed and that they didn't feel at ease with me because it looked like I was too serious. Everyone that knows me never seems to think that I'm serious. They don't think that I give a care about anybody or anything but myself. I don't mean to come of‎stream of consciousness‎0

‎     So, it's a Tuesday night, and there's nothing to do. I ate dinner earlier and can   feel the food digesting. I am rather anxious about something. Not terribly that it is   distracting, but I feel as though I am expecting something. It might be that I am   nervous about school. It's a new place for me, coming from Minnesota. I haven't   really made my close group of friends. Sure, I've been having loads of fun, but I   still don't have that complete feeling of acceptance yet. I haven't found my niche.   It's almost like I am waiting for it to be a month from now when I've found my place.   It's also hard in class, becuase I don't know many, hardly any at all, people in   them. I don't have people where I can go to work on projects or anything. This   makes me a little worried about how I am going to do, becuase I can't compare   answers on homework with friends, and I can't discuss new concepts with anyone.   I think that the move to a toally new placed this past month has been a little more   stressful than I originally expected. But I am not worried because there are so   many people here that I know it can't be too long before I find my place. Austin is a   great city also. That's a definite plus. The city has just a great atmosphere. I've   seen two concerts here and I love it. I can't wait to see even more of the city and   it's cool places. Music is a big part of my life and I think that is really going to make   me happy. It's great to know that just about every week there will be a concert or   something I will love to do. I am really excited to get to know some of the local   musicians. That'll be cool. I also have feelings that I want to have a girlfriend. I don't really know what I want   sexually. I feel like I want a steady girlfriend. Someone who I can always be close   with. I really think that will help make my transition into Texas easier. But it's hard   for me to find someone who I'll get along with this well. Another thing I think about   is committment. I dont' know if I want a long term relationship. Also, would it be to   distracting for be because of school?  I certainly know that school is my priority, but   now that I'm in college, I have to discover how much time I really need to spend   doing work to maintain my GPA. I think that the first semester is the hardest   because it's a new atmosphere‎stream of consciousness‎0

‎my roommate just called- she wants me to go get the vacuum cleaner from Vivian. I don�t want to do this because she'll say something about my bike, or the music. and I have to tell her about the fire alarm batteries being out because it was beeping. just while I was writing this I was thinking several different thoughts. I think it's not good that I don�t respect vivian's wishes. I really admire her because she's so old. I am not as nice as I used to be. it's funny to think about  writing for twenty minutes straight. but then again, we're always thinking, so why  should it be hard to write what you're thinking. it's getting easier for me to put my  into words, which is good for my relationships, and not to mention my future. I still don't talk that much though because I don't like saying something about nothing. but I guess that's a skill too. oh well- not one of mine. James and I have been getting along really well. ever since I fell asleep on his couch wishing to end the relationship because the passion was not there. then he picked me up in his arms, and took me to his bed and I must have cried for 30 minutes at least. he's so good to me. turns out the passion was dormant. for us to have fun and not argue so much, we've both realized each other's work loads, acknowledged my problems about the past, seeing how we react to each other, and respond lovingly to each other. thinking of what I just wrote sounds unnatural to me. but in reality, in this case at least, it came automatically. he realized how upset I was, and I realized how much he  cared. he's pretty much the leader. his feelings are much more dominant, and he's stronger and truer than me. maybe because I don't always know what I want. then he makes it apparent that  he's what I want. I miss being able to play the field, but what good is that when I have a really good person already?  he makes me laugh and we love, which is most  important in the person I share most my time with. men with potential, men that can show me the world. they can be my friends. like Sean. like jt. probably like any one that comes into my life- everyone has something to offer. and I will take it. James just has more than the average Joe. oooo - I've already spent 15 minutes. I should do this everyday for 10 minutes. not only is it a break from numbers, but I acknowledge my  thoughts, and I can go back and read it in the future to see my development. I want to be a model or an actor. I want the spotlight. sometimes. I want  to be a better gymnast. I don�t want to be judgmental. I want a copy of this. ‎stream of consciousness‎0

‎"""Well, first I'm thinking that I should've done this a few days ago instead of on the last day. There are still a few hours left, but it's never good to procrastinate. I guess it's ok because I've been very busy lately doing work for other classes. I'm usually in my dorm doing work instead of going to 6th street and getting drunk, which is what I thought I was supposed to be doing. Some of my friends call me a hermit"""" now because I'm in my dorm doing work a lot of the times. I don't really care. I'd rather be responsible. I do go out though. Yesterday I went with some friends to go watch a volleyball game. Now I'm feeling full and satisfied because I just ate a pizza and I was extremely hungry. I haven't felt this satisfied in a while. I don't really like most of the food in the cafeteria, but the pizza is good. I miss the food at home. I miss home a lot. I miss my family even though I talk to them over the phone just about every day. It's just not the same when you are away. Life at home this summer was so simple. I was just in my house very comfortable and without worries. I would go out with my girlfriend every few days. I miss her desperately. I think I was supposed to also describe what I'm smelling. I don't really smell anything right now. I wish I could smell my girlfriend's perfume again. I think that's my favorite smell of all. It's weird because I sometimes """"remember"""" what the scent was. I don't think that's supposed to happen. Now I'm thinking that I've been typing too damn much and my hands are getting tired. Oh well. It's in the name of science. Now I'm thinking that someone might probably be reading this. I feel sorry for whoever has that job. Sorry for writing this much. Sorry for not being very interesting. Now I'm remembering that I missed the rain again. I missed yesterday's rain because I was in my psychology class. When I got out, the ground was wet. It happened again today on the count of my pre cal class. Now I'm thinking that I probably should've done this thing on internet explorer instead of netscape because I think there should be a timer above this box thingy. Now I don't know when to stop. I'm probably going to stop too soon. I'll get an F in this assignment. I'll fail this class and be dropped. Then I won't be considered a full time student because I'm only taking 12 hours. I'll be forced to go home, and I will go home a failure. Hmm. that probably won't happen. After all, I've been having so much here, even though it is away from all that I hold dear. I think I have 10 more minutes to go. Now I'm feeling that I have to go take a leak. Dammit. It'll have to wait. I'm still‎stream of consciousness‎0

I like my roommate jen. she is a badass and we all have fun.

‎sure which one though. Maybe some drug movie or something. All that reading I have to do. College is way harder than I am wanting right now. I need more time for friends, sex, fun all that stuff. I think tomorrow after Mark comes over we will sleep for a while and then maybe we will mess around. I don't know. We always do if we are alone in bed for any period of time. I am so excited about the football game. I get to sit with who. let's see. Lindsey, Mark, and Ian, is that it? I can't even remember. Oh yeah wes did not have a sports package, and david did not give them his id. Man my neck hurts. I need another massage. That felt so good. I can't believe that Lindsey has Natalie in her Rhetoric class. I hope I get a good grade on my rhetoric response paper. I need to start off with good grades and then try to keep them up rather than start off with bad grades and then try to get them up. This is really not that bad of an assignment. I can handle it pretty well. I wonder who is on the phone. It must be Ian. What a weird kid. He is cool though. I am glad to have him as a friend. I wish Wes would be a little more open when I try to talk to him. He is nice and I think he likes me fine, but he just always acts strange around me like he is uncomfortable. except when we are drunk. Then we are like old friends. Who knows about that boy. He has a complex mind. It was nice of him to say that he would be my assistant editor any time. I'd be his for sure. He was drunk when he said that though. I hope he meant. Most people say that you say the truth when you are drunk, but some people think that you make stuff up when you are drunk. I don't, but I know some people do. I just want to have some new friends. I think I am going to friends with tracy she is nice and every time I see her, we talk for a while. Today, she said they were having a gijoe barbie party tomorrow night. All the girls come as barbie and all the guys come as gijoe. That sounds like fun. I kind of wish I was in a sorority, but I guess I will live. Oh well. There's twenty minutes.

‎Right now I am feeling good because today is Friday. So far I have really enjoyed my first week of school. I like all my classes so far, and I am embracing the whole college experience. I am also happy because I am going home to Houston today. It has only been a week since I left but I already miss my house and especially my parents. Right actually I do not have anything on my mind. I am pretty tired because I slept late last night and had a fairly early class. In fact, right now sleep would be really good. Well my stomach is also talking to me so I am also hungry. I have not eaten yet today. I am actually eating less in college since I seem to be always busy and always on the run. I like it though because maybe then I can lose some weight. Another thing in my mind is how complicated computers are. I never was really into computers in high school and now in college I have to constantly use it. I wish I was better with computers because I really think it is useful and is part of everybody's daily lives. I think the reason why I do not care for the computer much is because due to my impatience. I cannot really tolerate having to go in circles to find what I really want. For example this assignment would already have been done last night but for some reason I could not get into the website. However, I am glad I am finally able to finish my work after several tries late last night. I think it is quite interesting how a lot can be said about a person through their writing because right now it seems that I am rambling and to be honest I do not think that there's anything logical in my head right now. I am not really thinking about anything but what to write for this assignment, if that made any sense. My brain is just telling me to think of something to write. Actually I am also anticipating for the time to be up. Twenty minutes can be long when you do not have much to say. Speaking of waiting for the time to pass by, it has been twenty minutes. I am finally done. ‎stream of consciousness‎0

I'm used to reading material and having the professor reiterate what I had just learned. I guess that's something about college everybody has to learn. I just don't want to learn it the hard way. So I'm starting to form a study group. I really think these will help a lot. Although I hope the other people in the group are not thinking I'm using them for their notes. I'm not a good note taker, and I'll probably want to copy them from them. I also formed more study groups in each of my 4 classes. I'm a 12 hour student. That's another thing that gets me all depressed. I feel I might have clinical depression. It's something I'm checking out with a counselor next thursday. Four more minutes.

‎so it isn't that the (excuse me god for saying this) more ugly girls were saying this, but they were girls that you would classify as pretty hot and tempting. I hate using the word ugly, and I hate judging people. I don't. I always hear my friends going up, and saying """"Aaron, how in the hell does that guy have that beautiful girl, when he is so damn ugly"""". Okay, first of all, I am thinking that they are jealous, but evenso. Why? Why does it matter what he looks like? Why can't he be a  nice guy, who finally beat the system, and found himself a gorgeous girl that appreciates who he is. How he treats her. What he does for the world. What is up with this world? I NEVER say that shit, because there is no reason for it. I hate saying """"oh, he is ugly"""" and just making fun of people in general, because if you look at me, I am not the best looking guy on campus, and I have no right in heck to say that. I HATE HATE when my friends say it. But, it's the world. College was supposed to be different. The time for me (the outgoing quirky boy) to make some friends, and go out and have fun. It hasn't quite been that, and granted, I have only been here for a couple of days, but I am scared. I am scared that it is going to be like this for the rest of the year. I mean, I go out and meet people, but I don't know when or how to ask for their number, because it's just too weird in my eyes. We say when we leave """"See  you around"""", but have you realized the size of this campus. It's freakin' amazing. There are 50,000 students here, and it is atrocious as to how big this school is. It was supposed to be different. I mean, don't get me wrong, I don't have 12 eyes, and I have all my teeth, but it is still the same as in high school. I get befriended by the girls, which honestly is fine with me, because well, maybe it isn't. Maybe it would be nice to be gawked over for once, and maybe it would be nice to be wanted by a few girls here and there, but as of yet, it hasn't really happened. It's not that I am looking at all, because I am in love with Sooze, but it would be nice to have that feeling that when I walk into a room, people stare.

I think he will be good this year as lond as he doesn't get hurt. He has a good delivery and is really good at reading defenses. Speaking of defenses (I doubt this has any relation) but anyways I didn't make the hockey team today and it was really disappointing. I really wanted to make it and thought that I had a decent chance. Maybe I gave myself too much credit. Maybe I am not big enough or something. I wish I could have made it but I suppose that one was up to the coach and God. Speaking of God (random again) I went to a really neat church last Sunday. Its name is Glad Tidings. It is an assembly of God Church (although I am Lutheran I think it might be a good match because it has really awesome worship and the pastor gives interesting sermons). I miss my old church though. My youth minister back home is getting ordained this weekend. I am unsure if I should go home this weekend. I don't know. I think I will stay here because I really want to force myself to become independent even though that would entail me doing the laundry this weekend. I am really tired tonight but I suppose I will do my best to continue typing the entire 20 minutes. But along the thought of the laundry business. I have tried to hold off on doing it until next weekend (was going to do this weekend but I think I can make it until then). It has been really hot lately. It was brutal last Saturday trying to run in the morning. It was so humid. It eventually rained but not until after the practice. I have never been so sore in my life. I am still sore but I guess it doesn't matter seeing as I am not going to be playing for the team. I suppose it is sort of a waste but maybe I will try and keep in shape. I don't know though. We will see. Well I am half-way there. I am still tired and I am finding this assignment very boring and I suppose that would imply that my thoughts are boring. Kind of sad I suppose. I wish I weren't so lonely tonight. Just me and the TV. A horrible invention it is. Ruins relationships and limits time for many individuals. But I suppose it helps many escape.

I saw movies that I didn't want to see and it was pretty much like any other movie I've seen by myself but I remember them better I only have ten more minutes left I like to count I'm always counting things like yesterday I counted lance Armstrong bracelets 9 on the way to the theater building and seven on the was back Courtney's doesn't count could I didn't see it on the walk I am so bored right now but I am going to be so busy with soccer, broccoli project, circle k, and hopefully crew or rowing which sound the same to me but apparently with rowing you only have one ore and with crew you have two I don't know what else to right where is Chris‎stream of consciousness‎0

‎"""Well, I'm confused with my computer, its unusually working slowly and it freezes a lot. I gave my computer to my friend Neeraj who fixed the major problem of it. When I turned my computer on it would never load windows and the start up menu would appear. I thought that he broke it because he came from UH up here last week and he clocked my computer from 400MHz to 420MHz. After he left and I tried my computer it would not load Windows and the start up menu would always appear. So this labor day weekend I came home, my parents were shocked to see me because I forgot to tell them that I was coming. But they were happy and kept asking me how college is and giving me tips of not goofing around too much. I also went to eyemasters in West oaks mall there I was very shocked to see my friend Diana who is now a junior in high school but I still think of her as a freshmen because shes like a little sister to me. Everyone thinks she's very gorgeous I now think so too because I never thought of her that way. Anyways she told me her brother was getting her a job there because he works there. But she told me she didn't want to work there because her brither is there and she has to act a certain way and I know what she means. Her brother Wilmot is huge, he's probably 23 yrs old and he goes to UH. Well, I saw her there but I didn't say much, it was really busy I wish I could talk to her but I just said something on the lines of """"nice to see you, well bye"""" I went to eyemasters to get nose pads for my glasses. I use those glasses to play basketball with. But I saw prescription goggles there and that's what I've been looking for, they costed one hundred dollars though, I'll probably get them with my work study money, once I start recieving it. Yeah, I work at Batts hall and I the Jester media center ehich is upstairs. Gary Dickerson is my boss and he's really cool. He smokes and curses and is a gradute  of UT with a 3. 78 GPA!!  I really hope I do well in my first year at UT, my classes aren't extremely hard, but everyones like college is nothing like high school its very hard. Actually I see college as not hard but just a level. You have so much free time, you are 75% of the time out of class. So there;s a lot of time to study an make good grades. The bad part is you can never slack off more than a couple of times, and that's where I see people make their mistakes, I've seen and heard of so many people I know do very bad with horrendous GPA's and I don't understand. Do these people realize how lucky they are to be‎stream of consciousness‎0

‎     So I started my college life about two weeks ago. It has all gone pretty much as to what I had expected it to be like. I live in University Towers which is an off campus dorm and I have met tons of new people. I live with four girls whom I didnt know when I first started school. Some older people at the University set us up. I really like the fact that we are all starting new with each other. We get to experience our new life together. We get along great and do everything together. I am also really enjoying the fact that I get to make all my decisions on my own. Not having parents around all the time has its up's and it's downs. I mean I don't have someone annoying me all the time about finishing my work I have to realize when it has to be turned in and different deadlines for tests and projects. I have however found it kind of difficult to really take on a full schedule and truly realize everything that has to be taken care of in one full day. I have noticed that there aren't enough hours in the day to get everything completly finished. With homework, reading, running errands and outside activites there is so much to do with so little time. My roomate and I have had grown very close over the past two weeks. We have developed many habbits that we both enjoy. We realized that it takes the longest for the two of us to get ready and we love listening to music while we get ready because it pumps us up and gets us excited. I feel that the two of us are only going to get closer as our college life unfolds itself. We both experienced Texas Recruitment together. We both wanted to join the same sorority so that we could have another aspect of our life in college together to be the same. We accomplished another goal of us and we both got bids to the same sorority. I feel at home whenever I am at the house. Each and every girl is excited with open arms to welcome all 63 of the new pledges. I am so glad that not only are we roomates with each other we are sorority sisters as well. Other than my social life and living arrangements at school, the most important aspect is my education. I am taking 4 classes which comes out to 14 hours. I chose the classes that I wanted to take and the first two weeks have gone great. The work load started off fine and I think that I am going to be able to handle everything. I was a little nervous at first about the large classes because I came from a high school that was a decent size but the classes ranged from 10-35 people. My classes at Texas on the other hand were quite large. I didnt know if I was going‎stream of consciousness‎0

‎"""Hey you, So far so good, I've got Chem done and don't have to worry about this when I finish typing. wish I could type faster, without the errors too, that'd be great. Like Tony the tiger. Anyways, I'm happy as of the moment. I get to see Anthony today, and any day that that happens is a good day for me. (At least, most of the time)  =)   I like rings, that was the only thing I could think of. Sometimes when I write, (normally I write letters/notes to people) in this """"stream of consciousness ( which is a pain to spell) type of writing. But sometimes I try to be random and that just isn't fair to anyone. I  don't like this delete button, (I just don't like the fact I have to use it so much) anyways. I've been waking up on time so far. What has it been, 5 days? dear me, I'll never keep it up, being such not a morning person and all. But maybe I'll adjust, or not. I want internet access in my room, I don't' have it yet, but I will on Wed??? I think. But that ain't soon enough, cause I got calculus homework due by then, and I hate using the library computers or Jackie's. She's such a good friend, what would I ever do without her? no one knows. not even me, or you, whoever you are. Sorry I'm not interesting today, must have picked a bad day. The phrase """"academics first"""" just seems to be such a lie. Cause everywhere you go, it seems that """"athletics is first"""" or at least that's how it is in high school. Where you're AP physics teacher is also the softball coach and miss 1 class every week, (and you only have 2 or 3 classes a week to begin with) anyways. it's a pet peeve of mine. What others do I have? I'm not sure at the moment, I'm not sure about a lot of things though. Anthony is always saying """"you don't' know a lot do you?"""" and it's true, cause when I don't' know, I don't know, and I admit it. I wanted to take that polygraph test yesterday. I always wanted to see if I could beat one. But I can't lie very well to begin with. Can't lie to Mom, Jackie, and Anthony. but everyone else I can pass a few things by. By the way, (there's is nothing to add on to that, it was just what I thought) That's what you get when you assign this type of assignment. but I'm not complaining, I really enjoy it. it lets me think. cause when I think in my head, it doesn't' really work, I still don't know what I'm thinking. but when I write it, then I can at least see what I'm trying to think. My finger nails keep getting in the way of my typing. I must sound like a hick when I talk/type. but that's okay, cause I'm Texan‎stream of consciousness‎0

‎This is a hard assignment in the sense that I do not know what I am thinking. I have so much homework to do today. I really wish that I had more time to do everything I need to do before a new week starts. I cannot believe that it is already September. I am so ready for another three day weekend. I wish we had another break before Thanksgiving holiday. It is such a pretty day outside. I really should have exercised. I wonder if I will have time tomorrow. Oh well. I really need to go grocery shopping. I have nothing to eat in the apartment. I should ask Kristen if she wants to go to the store with me. Something else I need to do is call Grace about my trip to visit her this October. I really hope that the trip works out. I miss her. She is the funniest girl ever. I really want Mexican food for dinner, but I am having Italian. Oh well, Italian could also be good. At least I won't eat a thousand chips before I even get my meal. Instead I will eat about a pound of bread. Does that even make sense? A pound of bread? Oh I guess I mean a loaf of bread. Whatever. It is so quiet in this room right now. I wish there was something going on so that I could have something funny to think and therefore type about. This stream a consciousness essay must be really boring for someone to read. Actually I bet some of them are really interesting to read. I always am wondering what other people are thinking about. I wish that I was a better typer. I am a little faster than I use to be, but I still make a ton of mistakes. This essay could get pretty long considering the amount of thoughts I have in a twenty minute period. Oh I guess that I am not the only person home right now. I heard a door close it must be Kristen or Catherine. I love living in an apartment. It is so different that last year. I never made my bed. I should get in the habit of making my bed when I get out of bed each day. But then I know I would want to take a nap that day, and then I would just mess up the covers again. Beds are meant to be unmade. I guess that is how I feel now, but wait until I have a family of my own. I totally will be just like my mom and make my kids make their bed every day. I wish that I was as organized as my mom. She always has everything in the right place. I guess I will grow into being more organized one of theses days. I guess? Wow the time really has gone faster than I expected for this essay. but now that I noticed the time I bet it goes even slower. I hate the feeling‎stream of consciousness‎0
‎Well, I guess I get to finally do a reading assignment for psychology. I always wondered what's done with these assignments. whether they test us students for mental illness or just conduct some research on us as though we're guinea pigs. Oh well, I guess it's a good way in any case to get us involved, since it is part of our grade. Man, my back is feeling kind of itchy now from walking and riding around campus all day. I can't really concentrate for, wow, eighteen more minutes, since I've had quite a lack of sleep over the past few days. It's getting harder and harder to stay awake as the days go by. The thing that bothers me is that all my classes have more than three hundred students except for one of them, so there really is no one to keep me awake except maybe the occasional glance from the professor. I've been mostly lucky about getting good ones. I'm getting a bit hungry now but the time is keeping me in, and my stomach is starting to growl. Hmm, spaghettios or mac and cheese, or should I finally start off with something healthy, I mean there is a whole fridge full of food. maybe an apple, then some pasta. That would sound good. I need to do something to keep my freshman 15 off, maybe the occasional biking and the insane walking I do every day might work off those hamburgers. This computer screen is making my eyes blurry, and I'm now slowly falling asleep. Aww man, I actually have to stay awake today in order to pass my quiz tomorrow in theatre. It shouldn't be too bad. I don't even know if I'm supposed to be doing punctuation or capitalizing the words. It's not like this is an official paper, but since I'm a perfectionist I can't really deal with things that are out of line or place. I guess it only works on AOL because it's just faster to type this way. I just realized that I get off track too easily, I may have some form of ADD. I can barely even listen to myself talk for 20 minutes. It's really hard when I'm face to face with someone. I just can't stand in one place for that long. So, I just zone out. as I'm doing now. I'm slowly becoming less aware and careful of what I write. People sometimes think I'm drunk when I'm sending them mail, like when I sent a post card to a few friends back home while I was backpacking through Europe this summer with my brother. Where is he by the way? Oh yeah, he went to work today. I live with him, I thought it'd be hard since we always used to fight when we were little. I'd always want what he had and vice versa. So, when we were in Europe, we were good at some points bought kind of fought a majority of the time. I guess the difference here is that . um‎stream of consciousness‎0
