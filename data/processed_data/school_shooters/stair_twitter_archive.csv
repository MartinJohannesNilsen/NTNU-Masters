2014-07-01‎@sammy_botkin The wristbands automatically come with the first 20 submissions, so yes  ;D  I bought 21 in total, mainly because it's pricy.‎stair twitter archive

2014-06-08‎@imatu777 Great idea but I didn't really listen to music until like 2010. It's multiple genres though which helps.‎stair twitter archive
2014-06-08‎@imatu777 Both Live and studio versions. And other music. I talk the entire time over it though, so it's not very audible.‎stair twitter archive

2012-10-29‎Shows you, the slightest thing can wreck your video lol Re-rendering now. If everything checks out, I'll either upload today or overnight.‎stair twitter archive

2012-10-23‎Editing is going to make this video what it is. That's my main concern. Finishing this up and seeing what it looks like in post.‎stair twitter archive
2012-10-23‎Of blood on my shirt, that's it there's no going back. So I need to shoot in order, which I didn't last year for Horse Head Lives.‎stair twitter archive

2012-10-22‎@RandomShadowMan But thats my honest thoughts. Just the way it is these days  =/‎stair twitter archive
2012-10-22‎@RandomShadowMan Stay on top and that nets them money. Money on YouTube just grinds my gears. People on bottom get no recognition.‎stair twitter archive
2012-10-22‎@RandomShadowMan Look at iJustine. She has around 6. SIX PARTNERED CHANNELS. That's ridiculous. They need to do everything they can to‎stair twitter archive
2012-10-22‎@RandomShadowMan That's what people on top do. That's what they rely on, it sucks. That's why they have a million accounts.‎stair twitter archive
2012-10-22‎@freakshow180 That's what I feel too. They sold out. All it is today is everything that's a celebrity, nudity, and such. Fame got to them.‎stair twitter archive
2012-10-22‎@freakshow180 The partnership program ruined everything. That's what it's come to anymore on YouTube, cash.‎stair twitter archive

2012-10-22‎@RandomShadowMan As well as http://t.co/wRbCGJWO They got more than enough money and they just make gaming channels to cash in on more‎stair twitter archive
2012-10-22‎@RandomShadowMan Look at Smosh. They have at least 6 types of videos and at least 4 other channels besides the new gaming channel.‎stair twitter archive
2012-10-22‎@RandomShadowMan it's a shame. And that's what YouTube is coming to anymore. People on top making gaming channels just because.‎stair twitter archive
2012-10-22‎@RandomShadowMan Top partners are making gaming channels because they can for more revenue just by recording voice overs over gameplay‎stair twitter archive
2012-10-22‎@RandomShadowMan But he's still doing it for the money.‎stair twitter archive
2012-10-22‎A lot longer than my usual videos. So we'll see what happens.‎stair twitter archive

2012-02-10‎@freakshow180 But Sgt Pepper in mono is great. So much better than the stereo.‎stair twitter archive
2012-02-10‎@freakshow180 huge difference. I still prefer their mono tracks over stereo. Especially the older songs, sound clearer.‎stair twitter archive
2012-02-10‎@freakshow180 Problem was I always used to download off of youtube and the quality was always worse, until I bought the remaster box set.‎stair twitter archive

2010-09-23‎@nnaatteeks I will have to see. I mean I could charge it and send the camera but there's no point without the charger.‎stair twitter archive
2010-09-23‎For those wondering, it looks very similar to this but is blue on the viewfinder - http://bit.ly/bsGtVv‎stair twitter archive
2010-09-23‎@imatu777 I'd would say roughly over $100 without the charger and with probably $120. It still is relatively in good condition.‎stair twitter archive
2010-09-23‎@imatu777 If you were to buy it brand new it would be over $200 from best buy‎stair twitter archive
2010-09-23‎@imatu777 I cant though without the charger. Freakshow wont have one for his camera (he has the same one that I am selling).‎stair twitter archive
2010-09-23‎@imatu777 There would be no point sending a battery-dead camcorder to someone lol‎stair twitter archive
2010-09-23‎@imatu777 I guess what I could do is just charge it and send it fully charged. The person who buys it can search for a charger for it.‎stair twitter archive
2010-09-23‎@imatu777 But they would also need a memory card. They always screw you somehow lol You can record 30 seconds without a memory card‎stair twitter archive

2010-09-15‎@mightylions1 He has never replied to my @replys ever but did comment my channel (Fred) two years ago. Probably was a bot though. No idea.‎stair twitter archive
2010-09-14‎@makemebad35 lmao whats next? Ice cream soup? lol‎stair twitter archive
2010-09-14‎Im actually looking at the comments on Fred's latest video and am dead shocked on how many people have lost respect for him.‎stair twitter archive
2010-09-14‎And I agree that his old videos are waaaay better than these, but I still dont particularly like Fred, even his old videos.‎stair twitter archive
2010-09-14‎He is making these videos that are twice as annoying as the past ones and is getting paid for them and music albums, plus the movie.‎stair twitter archive
2010-09-14‎It is just getting out of hand with Fred. I bet not even a 1/4 of his subscribers like his videos. IDK but thats my opinion on Fred.‎stair twitter archive
2010-09-14‎@nnaatteeks I used to like his vids a lot but then his season three really dropped the ball. It's the same thing every time‎stair twitter archive
2010-09-14‎@nnaatteeks And plus his scenes and camera shots transition so fast, you cant digest what the hell just happened.‎stair twitter archive
2010-09-14‎@imatu777 What?‎stair twitter archive
2010-09-14‎But he can only do the character for so long.It's just gotten out of hand, especially with a near 18 year old acting 6. Hope the movie is it‎stair twitter archive

2010-09-14‎@synthplaya Well thats what gets me thinking. What is he going to do when he needs to quit Fred? Post other stuff on the channel?‎stair twitter archive
2010-09-14‎@synthplaya No way in hell he would delete the channel. Almost 2 million subs. What will happen is the question.‎stair twitter archive
2010-09-14‎@nnaatteeks I dont hate Lucas, I just hate Fred. Anything he does after Fred wont be nearly as bad. Act your own age for once!‎stair twitter archive

2010-09-14‎@imatu777 Theres no way Lucas would do that. It's his creation and he's making thousands upon thousands of dollars off of it.‎stair twitter archive

2010-09-14‎@imatu777 I just cant wait to see the outcome of all of this. Either way, his channel will die out eventually.‎stair twitter archive

2009-11-26‎@jo129d I meant give away subs, but then again it would be fake so it wouldnt work out‎stair twitter archive
2009-11-26‎&gt;@theeyebrandon brought up a good idea. At the start of every month I will do the QOTD each day and at the end of the month upload a vid‎stair twitter archive

2009-11-26‎@jo129d But anyways nah I dont think I would do that because it is just like subs, if the same person gets it right, I would make new accnts‎stair twitter archive
2009-11-26‎@jo129d So with theeyebrandons idea I CAN give away subs because hundreds of people will see the vid at the end of each month including u =)‎stair twitter archive
2009-11-26‎@jo129d YOU could get subs‎stair twitter archive
2009-11-26‎@jo129d Well hundreds of people will see the results and will most likely check out the channels‎stair twitter archive
