‎Oh the happiness I could have had mingling among you hedonists, being counted as one of you, only if you didn’t fuck the living shit out of me. You could have been great. I could have been great. Ask yourself what you did to me to have made me clean the slate.‎Seung Hui Cho
‎Only if you could be the victim of your reprehensible and wicked crimes, you Christian Nazis, you would have brute-restrained your animal urges to fuck me. You could be at home right now eating your fucking caviar and your fucking cognac, had you not ravenously raped my soul.‎Seung Hui Cho
‎For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. Can you feel the pain that you fucked us in, you Descendants of Satan? Well, can you feel it?‎Seung Hui Cho
‎All the shit you’ve given me, right back at you with hollow points. Don’t you just wish you finished me off when you had the chance? Don’t you just wish you killed me?‎Seung Hui Cho
‎You had a hundred billion chances and ways to have avoided today, but you decided to spill my blood. You forced me into a corner and gave me only one option. The decision was yours. Now you have blood on your hands that will never wash off, you Apostles of Sin.‎Seung Hui Cho
‎Congratulations. You have succeeded in extinguishing my life. Vandalizing my heart wasn’t enough for you. Raping my soul wasn’t enough for you. Committing emotional sodomy on me wasn’t enough for you. Every single second wasted on your wanton hedonism and menacing sadism could have been used to prevent today. Ask yourselves, What was I doing all this time? All these months, hours, seconds. Only if you could have been the victim of your crimes. Only if you could have been the victim . . .‎Seung Hui Cho
‎To you sadistic snobs, I may be nothing but a piece of dog shit. You have vandalized my heart, raped my soul, and torched my conscious again and again. You thought it was one pathetic, void life that you were extinguishing. Thanks to you, I die, like Jesus Christ, to inspire generations of the Weak and Defenseless people — my Brothers, Sisters, and Children — that you fuck. Like Moses, I spread the sea and lead my people — the Weak, the Defenseless, and the Innocent Children of all ages that you fucked and will always try to fuck — to eternal freedom. Thanks to you Sinners, you Spillers of Blood, I set the example of the century for my Children to follow.‎Seung Hui Cho
‎You may stand steadfast on the battlefield of your life’s dedication to eternal terrorism American Al-Qaeda, but the Children that you have fucked will rise. By the power greater than God we will hunt you down, you Lovers of Terrorism, and we will kill you. Do they wanna fuck us and pretend to be devout Christians? Do they wanna smear dog shit on our face then give us a dirty towel to wipe away? Do they wanna rape us then give us stained toilet paper to clean up? Do they wanna cut our throat then give us a used band aid to patch up? Do they wanna perpetrate endless sessions of crucifixions and holocausts on our innocent life then go to church and praise the Lord and Jesus? Do they wanna fuck us and pretend to be Jesus Christ? I say we’re the Jesus Christs, my Brothers, Sisters, and Children. Jesus Christ exists in us all: Ax Jesus Christ, John Jesus Christ, Jane Jesus Christ, Seung Jesus Christ, Carlos Jesus Christ, Hakeem Jesus Christ, Mohammad Jesus Christ, Zhang Jesus Christ, Oliver Jesus Christ, Elizabeth Jesus Christ, Vladimir Jesus Christ. ___________ Jesus Christ. I say there is no pain they can inflict on us that they haven’t already inflicted. I say they can’t fuck us any more than they have already done. I say there are no lies they can say about us that they haven’t already said. I say fuck you, you Descendants of Satan Disguised as Devout Christians. I say we take up the cross, take up our guns and knives and hammers, and take no prisoners and spare no lives until our last breath and last ounce of energy.‎Seung Hui Cho
‎Seer of Veracity. Seal of the Anti-Terrorist.‎Seung Hui Cho
‎Number of the Anti-Terrorist. You wanna rape us John Mark Karrs? You wanna rape us Debra LaFaves? Fuck you.‎Seung Hui Cho
‎By destroying we create. We create the feelings in you of what it is like to be the victim, what it is like to be fucked and destroyed. Because of your annihilations, we create and raise new breeds of Children who will show you fuckers what you have done to us. Like Easter, it will be a day of rebirth. It will be a start of a revolution of the Children that you fucked. You have never felt a single ounce of pain your whole life, thus, by destroying you, by giving you pain, we attempt to show you responsibilities and meanings of other people’s lives.‎Seung Hui Cho
‎It’s grand for you to fuck us 24/7 for fun, but we can’t have a single minute of harmless playtime, only suffer. It’s dandy for you to rape us, but we’re not allowed to even speak, only be raped? Fuck you. You love to pretend to, but you Hedonists, Charlatans, Sadists, Rapists, Terrorists will never know the feelings of giving up your lives for a cause. You have never felt a single ounce of pain in your hedonistic lives. You will never give up a single can of your Bud Light, a shot of your cognac, or a half-drop of your own precious blood for another human being, only fuck the shit out of him and lie afterwards. You fucked us, now we fuck you, now we kill you. There can be no lighter penalty for Masqueraded Democratic Terrorists who commit unforgivable acts of treason against mankind. There is no where in the world you can run, you Lovers of Terrorism. There is nowhere in the world you can hide, you Lovers of Sadism. You will never know when and where the Weak and Defenseless that you fucked will strike — day, night, at school, in the public, in your home, during your most comfortable hour and protected place. You will never know how we will kill you — slash your throat, bullet in your back, torture you with knives, hammers, bolt cutters, scissors. You will always live in fear. You will never be able to go to school or work or rest or sleep. Your heart will always pound nonstop. Your sin-ridden soul will slowly eat up your conscious for the heinous crimes you  have committed. So if you don’t want to die a painful death, do yourself a favor, do yourself a coup de grace, and kill yourself clean or you will endure pains you can never feel but with our hands. Kill yourself or we will hound you down and rip you, all your friends, and all your family into small pieces.‎Seung Hui Cho
‎We have no sympathy in killing humans who have no respect for other people’s lives.‎Seung Hui Cho
‎Now that the slate has been cleaned and you have the world’s attention, the question is what are you going to do? Are you going to admit the truth or are you going to stand resolute on your mission to eternally fuck the Weak and the Defenseless and lie about it? Are you still going to use your power and manipulate the truth to end up with some sort of profit as you have always done? Are you going to skip over all the crimes you’ve committed and act as victims to the world so you can suck in millions of donation money to turn the situation into a profit? Your two million dollar house wasn’t enough? Your BMW wasn’t enough? Your inheritances weren’t enough? You have to fuck and steal form the Poor and the Weak who have nothing in order to gratify your fucking pride and hedonism? What are you going to do with the blood money? Buy a new Mercedes? You want to brainwash your bratty, snobby kids that its right to steal from the poor, the Weak, and the Defenseless to always stay in power? The fat surpluses that you roll on everyday aren’t enough? Fuck you. Your answer rings loud and clear. I saw we take up the cross, Children of Ishmael, take up our guns and knives and any sharp objects, and take no prisoners and spare no lives until our last breath and last ounce of energy.‎Seung Hui Cho
‎The blood of the Innocents should never be shed, but the wicked we shall spread our wings and strike. We do not want the Weak, the Defenseless, or the Innocent, but the sadistic, the corrupt, and the wicked who prey and rape from the Weak, the Defenseless, and the Innocent. We will seek and demolish them until our last breath. You Lifetakers may have succeeded in raping our souls and shattering our dreams — but mark our words — the vendetta you have witnessed today will reverberate throughout every home and every soul in America and will inspire the Innocent kids that you have fucked to start a war of vendetta. We will raise hell on earth that the world has never witnessed. Millions of deaths and millions of gallons of blood on the streets‎Seung Hui Cho
‎will not quench the avenging phoenix that you have caused us to unleash. Generation after generation, we martyrs, like Eric and Dylan, will sacrifice our lives to fuck you thousand folds for what you Apostles of Sin have done to us. Pain of every atom between air and water, sky and ground, heaven and hell, life and death wouldn’t begin to explain the experience that we went through under your wrath. What did you expect me to do, you violators of human rights?‎Seung Hui Cho
‎As the time approached, I wished for a last minute miracle and discard this mission you’ve given me. Heaven knows I wouldn’t hurt a single leaf of a flower. But when the time came, I did it. I had to. What other choices did you give me? All this time. . . You never know that a human being is capable of doing until you fuck him to the edge. When you’re raped of everything, you got nothing to lose.‎Seung Hui Cho
‎If you have a single milligram of conscience, a grain of integrity, a speck of heart, you will kill yourself for all the lives you have brutally extinguished. Can you now see all that used to be, all that could have been, and all that is to come, you Sadistic Charlatans.‎Seung Hui Cho
‎All of you who have ever been fucked by these Descendants of Satan Disguised as Devout Christians, all of you who have went through what I went through, all of you who have felt what I have felt in my life, all of you who have suffered the wrath of these Democratic Terrorists, all of you who have been beaten, humiliated, and crucified — Children of Ishmael, Crusaders of Anti-Terrorism, my Jesus Christ Brothers and Sisters — you’re in my heart. In life and death and spirit. We’ll soon be together.‎Seung Hui Cho
‎Let the revolution begin!‎Seung Hui Cho
‎Die you Descendants of Satan! Fuck you, and die now! I am Ax Ishmael. I am the Anti-Terrorist of America.‎Seung Hui Cho
‎Are you happy now that you have destroyed my life? Now that you have stolen everything you could from me? Now that you have gone on a 9/11 on my life like fucking Osama. Now that you have fucked your own people like fucking Kim Jong-Il. Now that you have gone on a hummer safari on my life like fucking Bush? Are you happy now?‎Seung Hui Cho
2011-12-30‎"In a time long since, a time of repent, The Renaissance. In a quaint lonely town, sits a man with a frown. No job. No family. No crown. His luck had run out. Lost and alone. The streets were his home. His thoughts would solely consist of ""why do we exist?"" His only company to confide in was the vermin in the street. He longed for only one thing, the world to bow at his feet. They too should feel his secret fear. The dismal drear. His pain had made him sincere. He was better than the rest, all those ones he detests, within their castles, so vain. Selfish and conceited. They couldn't care less about the peasents they mistreated. They were in their own world, it was a joyous one too. That castle, she stood just to do all she could to keep the peasents at bay, not the enemy away. They had no enemies in their filthy orgy. And in her, the castles every story, was just another chamber of Lucifer's Laboratory. The world is a sandbox for all the wretched sinners. They simply create what they want and make themselves the winners. But the true winner, he has nothing at all. Enduring the pain of waiting for that castle to fall. Through his good deeds, the rats and the fleas. He will have for what he pleads, through the eradication of disease. So, to the castle he proceeds, like an ominous breeze through the trees. ""Stay back!"" The Guards screamed as they were thrown to their knees. ""Oh God, have mercy, please!"" The castle, she gasped and then so imprisoned her breath, to the shallow confines of her fragile chest. I'm on the lamb but I ain't no sheep. I am Death. And you have always been the sod. So repulsive and so odd. You never even deserved the presence of God, and yet, I am here. Around your cradle I plod. Came on foot, without shod. How improper, how rude. However, they shall not mind the mud on my feet if there is blood on your sheet. Now! Feel death, not just mocking you. Not just stalking you but inside of you. Wriggle and writhe. Feel smaller beneath my might. Seizure in the Pestilence that is my scythe. Die, all of you."‎Thomas Michael Lane

2004-02-09‎I’m just too afraid of the future. I could do all I’ve planned, but then what if some bum gets a gun and shoots me? What if there’s a huge war? What if terrorists strike and I lose family? What if some fuck up kidnaps me, rapes me, tortures me, then kills me? Too much I’m afraid of. I’ve had issues the majority of my life. I still do, obviously. But I hoped I would get better and become a state trooper. I don’t ask for help, because what if I get better, then can’t be a cop? That’s all I want to do. But now I’m just too afraid. I believe whatever I believe will happen in the after-life, will happen. When I die I’m going to heaven. I’m NOT A MONSTER. I’ve been happy for a while, but it wasn’t true happiness, I just made it seem that way. Who should you blame? SOCIETY. My mom wanted to believe I was better, and I made it seem that way. Dr. Mooney couldn’t even see this coming. Christina just thought maybe suicide. Oh YEA, blame Four Winds. Those bastards were horrible. I faked my happiness to get out. My dad treated my family like shit, back in the day. Now he’s better, but the past hurts. He also told me I had no way of being a fireman when I was about ten or eleven. FAMILY Mom – I love you. You treated me like a King. Thank you for everything. It’s not your fault. Dad – You use to hit me, and you beat Matt a lot. Wouldn’t be surprised about you hitting Jay. Have a good few years. Jay – You were my father figure. Why do you think I played the bass? To be like you! I love you. Sometimes I acted like you were a bad bro, that was just in my head. You were a great brother. Thank you. Matt – We never really talked till I started Asheron’s Call. Ever since then, it’s been great. You too were a role-model to me. I love you. Thanks. Rachel – You lived with me the longest of the siblings. You were a GREAT sister! Tell Kayla and Tasha I said Good-Bye! They’re great people. I LOVE YOU! Lee – My cousin, we probably would’ve had a future together. We could’ve been like Kwinn and Kerri. Have fun with life, stay out of trouble. Aunt Donna + Uncle Hooch – You two were great to me. Aunt Donna giving me rides, and Uncle Hooch being my good friend. Remember when you invited everyone to Vermont? That was great. Playing Risk, I partnered with Hooch because he’s the God Father! Good times. Thanks. LOVE Jesse – We never really talked, but you offered help for me at HVCC. It was great talking with you at the wedding. Kwinn + Elizabeth – Wow, you two are great people! Kwinn gave me my first swiss army knife. That had no bad effect though, don’t worry! Sorry for the incident at Hatch Lake. If you two ever need financial help, go to my mom. It’s one of my last wishes that she helps you two. Love you! Uncle Scott + Aunt Lyn – Thanks for always having X-mas parties and Thanksgiving parties. Fun times. Kristi – Lil cous, I don’t know how much you’ll remember of me, but I just want you to know I’m not an evil person. I don’t want you to look back and think that I was. In a few years, I hope you’ll start to understand. To all other family – I’m sorry. FRIENDS Christina – Wow, you were a huge part of my life. You’re my babygirl, and I love you with all my heart. So sorry. Too many memories to say Kelli – IDK what to say. Thanks for the good times “GPF” – some of you were good friends. some weren’t Good-Bye, and good luck in life. Brad – You had issues, so do I. That’s why we fought. But now, we’re friends again. Thanks for the good times. I love you like a brother. Mike – You’re lucky, don’t fuck things up. Barry – You have issues. get some help Amy – You were one of the people that made me think, thanks. Love you Jessica – We haven’t talked lately, but thanks for the friendship Jenny – You were the first girl I cared about. Too bad we never hooked up. But I remember you kissed me on the cheek after a dance once. Hehe. People I Hate Mrs. Greer – Brad can explain. Bitch Mr. Cranell – Liar FUCK YOU Jeff McCabe – Talk shit behind my back. Fuck you, I hope you rot in Hell. There’s other friends and people I hate, but it’s time to watch “Bowling for Columbine” I’M SORRY I WISH IT Was DIFFERENT wait look on next page I’ve been watching Bowling for Columbine. How am I different than what the media says school shooters are? TV I watch: Jay Leno, Conan O’Brien, Family Guy, SNL, Mad TV, Simpsons, Law and Order, Monk, and others. oh, South Park! Man Show (Jimmy + Ad Music: Country music! Toby Keith! Movies: ok, movie I watch have some violence. Groose Pointe Blank, South Park, The Frighteners, Cruel Intentions, Animal House, Blown Away, 10 Things I Hate About You (yes a chick flick) and others, just ask my friends. I like to laugh! Comedies are good! I’m not what the media says I should be. But why Columbia (other than I hate it for obvious reasons)? About eleven months ago, I was in Four Winds. I told a couple people (Barry, Brad) because they wouldn’t care. But I guess everyone knew. And one day, Four Winds received a fax about people from Columbia saying that I said “I am going to kill myself and no one can stop me.” I figure that’s why I was there longer than I should have. So Columbia, IT’S YOUR FAULT.‎Jon Romano
2004-01-24‎Rachel, It’s January 24, 2004 and you’re leaving home. This time, I have a feeling you’ll be gone for a long time. Next thing you’ll know, I’ll be out of here! Life goes by quick. This letter is just to say good-bye, and I can’t wait to end up with something like Mom and her siblings have, with you, Jay and Matt. Me and you have been hanging out lately, but I can’t wait for the future. Just think about ten years from now. What will you do? Where will you live? Will you have kids? Be married? These questions apply for me, Jay and Matt too. Will you be Aunt Dex? LOL. What about thirty years from now? Will we all have kids? Will they get along? Who knows we’ll find out soon enough. Love, Jon‎Jon Romano
2010-07-05‎My favorite two are Bloody Wednesday (It was significantly better than The Shining even with its many editing errors) and Stalking Laura. It’s impressively detailed for a “The following is based on a true story.” movie, like it’s the more fictionally-oriented Richard Farley version of Zero Hour. It’s my favorite movie of any genre.‎Adam Lanza

2011-01-12‎While Jared Loughner apparently is one of the very few mass murderers who is legitimately delusional (Although I haven't completely determined that yet; crimes which receive a lot of media attention sort of irritate me and I usually defer reading about them for a while), he would have likely said exactly the same thing if Jared Loughner had been phenomenally eloquent. Like everyone, he advises to treat the symptoms rather than determining whatever causes there may be. Overall, he was fumbling around not saying anything meaningful. The way which this particular incident is being treated is frustrating to me. Jiverly Voong inflicted a similar number of casualties with more than double the deaths not too long ago, and he was virtually ignored compared to this. I hate how the lives of state-sanctioned thugs are treated as if they're more valuable than that of anyone else.‎Adam Lanza

2011-01-31‎It seems like an irrelevant question to be concerned about. No one can obtain knowledge about what happens after death, nor if anything is required to do for the deceased. If some ritual was necessary, no one could know about it nor have any knowledge about the requirements of it. Perhaps there's a magical platypus who requires that you burn a wooden effigy of a hamster so that the deceased can ride it to the gates of Valhalla. From observing other people who have died, the only conclusion which can be reached is that nothing happens. Treating death as if it's the end of everything would be the most prudent course of action because believing that something happens is contrary to the observable world of the life which you are certain about having, thus deluding you into behaving in a way which could negatively impact your life.‎Adam Lanza
2011-01-31‎It's a loaded question which requires that you think of any of the relationships in your life, romantic or otherwise, in an immutable traditional context instead of an association of two particular individuals.‎Adam Lanza

2011-02-01‎"(Incidentally, certain further evaluations which someone could have about the person who's kissing/asking were included for the answers (cute/chivalrous/throwing themselves/spontaneity/insecurity), but I'll pretend that the answers are only ""Yes"", ""Maybe"", and ""No"".) Perhaps I shouldn't have answered at all (especially considering how inaccurately I phrased it), but I'll try to describe what I meant: For anyone to give a meaningful answer to the fundamental question which I think you're asking (""Do you consider it generally desirable for someone to ask before kissing?"") from which someone could potentially learn and modify their behavior accordingly, it would need to have an unimaginable number of variables and qualifiers. However, even if answers could be given for the impossibly detailed question, they would end up becoming meaningless because they would be so specific to the situation. That's why for the fundamental question to be reasonably asked, it understandably needs to include a particular scenario. In this case, it is a traditional end-of-date scenario between a potential romantic couple. That brings with it innumerable preconceived assumptions about the hypothetical relationship between the two people. We can only answer according to our interpretations of the context of the contrived relationship itself, eliminating the value of any of our answers. Basically, because of all of this, we can't accurately answer the question which you're really wanting to ask. I can't honestly answer with ""Maybe"". No matter how it is asked, I don't think that the fundamental question itself can ever be reasonably answered at all. Although it's possible that I'm genuinely not intelligent enough to figure out how I could provide an appropriate answer to the question."‎Adam Lanza

2011-02-06‎"I haven't looked into this much in the past couple of years, but I can think of a few reasons as to why he killed 1 and injured 19. I vaguely remember reading that most of the injuries were inflicted to limbs, which are rarely fatal. I also remember him complaining about this: ""When My Rifle Misfires And I Gotta Stand There For 60 Seconds Waiting For It To Fire, Or Not"". He was describing this: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hang_fire It's uncommon for high-quality ammunition to hang fire. If he was using the same cheap cartridges for his massacre, then the bullets were likely full metal jacketed. Beyond that, his 9mm Beretta Cx4 Storm innately wasn't a particularly effective firearm. The difference in velocity between a 9mm rifle and 9mm pistol is usually 15% at best. The benefits which a 9mm rifle has for a novice are basically its reduced recoil and greater distance between the front and rear sights. It allows faster and more accurate shots, although that was inconsequential for Kimveer Gill if he was aiming as poorly as I assume he was"‎Adam Lanza
2011-04-15‎You believe that a degenerate capitalistic system results in a commodification of sexuality. This enables the creation of a cultural notion that premarital sexuality is acceptable. This results in sexuality becoming widespread. This has three primary consequences: The first is that there are some males who believe that the existence of this attitude of sexuality is a justification of date rape, which causes instances of it to increase. The second is that the existence of this attitude destroys the significance of marriages. Fewer people get married, and of the people who do get married, more divorce. The third is that the prevalence of sexuality results in more abortions, and more unwanted children, than would otherwise result. You believe that it would be desirable to outlaw premarital sex to cause a gradual cultural shift away from all of this. And I would like you to briefly elaborate on something so that I can better understand your position. What is it about marriage that appeals to you, and why do you oppose the prevalence of divorces?‎Adam Lanza

2011-10-24‎"I had known about Targets (1968) for a while, but I expected it to only tack on a Charles Whitman-style sniper to augment a plot which would have been too lame to stand on its own. I saw it yesterday, and I was surprised to find that the sniper was the main character, with the aging actor being the tacked-on character! I don't know how I can describe it. It's like a blend of Bloody Wednesday and Stalking Laura. It isn't serious in the various ways that those two can be taken (Yes, I just called Bloody Wednesday serious in some sense), while still being sincere. It's like what Duck! should have been. I think it's the most pleasurable movie about a mass shooting that I've seen. And I can forgive the movie for including the incredibly-lame subplot because of how lightheardedly-awesome the climax of its intersection with the sniper is. If you watch it, I recommend skipping any scene which doesn't include the Charlie clone; at best, you'll only be missing some pretentious pseudo-philosophizing about aesthetics. Anyway, it made me wonder if it was the earliest portrayal of a mass/spree shooting. Before hearing about Targets, I thought that Thriller: A Cruel Picture was the earliest one (deliberately ignoring If....). As far as I know, Thriller is still the earliest movie which portrays a trench-coated shooter (with the ""criminal aura"", not the ""detective aura""). Does anyone know of any earlier ones, for either of the two categories? Today I saw The Sniper (1952), which was released when Charles Whitman was still a wee Boy Scout, but the main character was more of a serial killer. Despite that disappointment, it was still excellent and presciently anticipated future psychological horrors. Now that I think of it, I'm sure that Charles Whitman must have snuck into a showing of The Sniper and eventually ended up imitating what he saw. After all, the sniper in the movie used a variant of an M1 carbine, which was one of the rifles that was brought up the Austin tower. What has the media done to our children?"‎Adam Lanza
2011-10-24‎"The trailer seems to agree with my evaluation. The subplot character is thrown onto the last ten seconds as if to say, ""Hey, look! We've got some famous actor for whom we'll contrive the faintest justification to include!"" And upon further inspection, I think I've recovered a deleted scene from some alternative universe in Back To The Future. http://i1226.photobucket.com/albums/ee4 ... hmarty.gif And some trivia about that, the head gangster from Bloody Wednesday was the Libyan van driver!

2011-11-08‎"The guy who wrote Pumped Up Kicks said that the song is about an outcast teenager losing his mind while plotting revenge without any explicit violence occurring. People have interpreted that to mean that it's about a school shooting. Because of the name Robert, Robert Hawkins has now become a stereotypical poster child of school shootings. If any name other than ""Robert"" had been used for the song, no one would have associated Robert Hawkins with Pumped Up Kicks. If the name ""Robert"" had still been in the song, but Robert Hawkins had actually been 32 years old (the average age of American mass murderers in the last 20 years), again, no one would have associated him with Pumped Up Kicks. They would have instead said that ""Pumped Up Kicks is surely about Robert Steinhauser"", not at all because he fits in with it better than anyone else would have, but merely because his name was ""Robert"". At least with Robert Steinhauser, it almost sort of vaguely fits in with the interpretation many people have that the song is about school shootings. Robert Hawkins's mass murder unquestionably was not a school shooting: he shot up an upscale shopping store. Without applying my pet theory as to the origin of mass murder, which you're accusing me of doing, anyone can see that Robert Hawkins did explicitly share the socioeconomic characteristics of much older mass murderers. Instead of approaching it through simply stereotyping him as a school shooter who was bullied by his classmates, it would thus be more accurate to approach it through simply stereotyping him as maybe being a young version of Mark Barton, with whom he shared many similarities. http://www.independent.co.uk/news/i-don ... 09610.html If you interpret Pumped Up Kicks to be about school shootings and you think that Robert Hawkins is a better representation for a song about ""an outcast teenager losing his mind while plotting revenge without any explicit violence"" than Evan Ramsey or Michael Carneal would have been; and if you think that Pumped Up Kicks has more to do with Robert Hawkins in particular than the Omaha Shopping Mall Blues does, then I don't know what I can say. It's akin to saying that I Don't Like Mondays was about Charles Whitman. I mean, in a sense I guess it could be, but it would be absurd to say that it's a better representation of him than it is of Brenda Spencer; and if you want to think of I Don't Like Mondays being about Charles Whitman, it would be absurd to say that this song, http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlBuoBV-Sa0 has less to do with Charles Whitman than I Don't Like Mondays does."‎Adam Lanza

2011-12-04‎"Other than the whole ""Robert"" thing, the only indication that Pumped Up Kicks could be about Robert Hawkins in particular is that he used his stepfather's Kalashnikov; but that's not something unique to him because, according to the best information that I have available, around 75% of American <25-year-old mass shooters used firearms which they didn't legally own, compared to around 25% of American >24-year-old mass shooters. Instead of being an explicit reference to Robert Hawkins, it could just be a throwaway reference to a common aspect of young mass shooters. Anyway, diverging from my whining, I serendipitously rediscovered Robert C. Bonelli Jr. after having forgotten about him for a while. http://goathillstudio.com/albums/media% ... oto_13.jpg The only explicit information that I could find about him regarding his teenage years was that he had dropped out of high school at age 16. At age 24, he was an extremely shy outsider who was constantly worried about being picked on for being reportedly 260 pounds at 5'10"". His duplex neighbor said that he was ""the kind of kid who gets picked on in high school"". His uncle said that he had an inferiority complex, always being self- conscious about the way he looked, his weight, and how no girl would ever want him. Along with being depressed for many previous years, he had been having trouble with alcohol and drug abuse. He spent almost all of his time alone in his room where he kept ""a shrine of Columbine memorabilia"", which included newspaper clippings, ""TV documentaries about 'the darker side' of Columbine"", and news accounts & pictures printed from the internet, along with a picture of Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold taped to his wall. He had a video which included him building and exploding pipe bombs with two other local dropouts, one of whom's girlfriend said that he had frequently spoken about killing himself. It's rumored that he also had multiple bootlegs of the album which contains this song: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6sZokeNzYw&t=16s If he didn't actually have it, I'm sure that he would have if he had known about it. He repeatedly took cocaine early in the morning of Sunday, February 13, 2005. Possibly precipitated by a girl rejecting his friendship several days earlier, he decided to kill himself. Dressed in black, he left a suicide note at his house, borrowed his father's car, and drove to the Hudson River with the Hesse Model 47 he had legally bought at a gun show four months earlier. He held the rifle to his head but couldn't kill himself. He drove around aimlessly, and saw a police car in the parking lot of the Hudson Valley Mall in Kingston, New York. He decided to get the police to publicly kill him. He wrote a second suicide note at some point and left it in his car. The only information I could find on either of them was from the second one, which included the Dylan quote, ""The lonely man strikes with absolute rage"". He had written somewhere (I don't know any details) that he had been wanting to do this before the Columbine anniversary. About an hour prior to the shooting, he went to a Walmart to buy ammunition and returned to the mall. He considered waiting until the coming Monday to do it at a school, but demonstrably decided against it. He parked in front of the Best Buy (presumably the most convenient entrance, going by Google satellite) and sat in his car for twenty minutes. Just before 3:15 PM, he picked up his rifle and walked toward the mall. He shot three times at the front door, which caused ricocheting bullet fragments and shrapnel to superficially hit his first victim. The victim's daughter's purse and pants were each penetrated once, but she remained uninjured. Once he entered the Best Buy, he spent the next seven minutes aimlessly shooting in the store. He never shot from the shoulder and most of the bullets struck the ceiling and floor. The most aiming he did involved shooting from his hip at televisions and blank walls. He had many opportunities to shoot people but bypassed all of them. He reloaded once and eventually left the Best Buy, entering the main corridor where he spent the next two minutes shooting out store displays while walking toward the center of the mall. It was here that he shot his second victim in the knee. When he had expended all of his ammunition, he dropped his rifle and calmly surrendered. He was subsequently sentenced to 32 years in prison. Robert Bonelli and Robert Hawkins (who both went by Robbie) both used AK-47 variants (although Bonelli's was a very cheap model), and both of them had two 30-round magazines (although Bonelli's weren't fancily jungle-taped together like Hawkins's). While Robert Hawkins used 2/3 of it and killed eight people and injured four, Robert Bonelli used all of it, but only directly shot one person and indirectly shot a second. The only time that I'm aware of Robert Hawkins deliberately shooting at anything other than a human was when he shot a teddy bear, but none of Robert Bonelli's shots were deliberate. Likewise, I cannot seeing anything which indicated that Robert Hawkins had been significantly affected by (the conventional interpretation of ) bullying nor peer rejection, but Robert Bonelli seems to be a different case. If any ""Robert"" fits in with the school shooting interpretation of the song about ""an outcast teenager losing his mind while plotting revenge without any explicit violence"", it's Robert Bonelli, not Robert Hawkins. The only issue is that he was 24 years old, not a teenager; but Robert Hawkins was practically the same age, being less than a half a year from 20. Anyway, ""teenager"" was my word, with the Pumped Up Kicks guy always saying ""kid"" and ""youth"". Robert Bonelli still doesn't fit in with it better than Evan Ramsey or Michael Carneal would. And Pumped Up Kicks is still a really lame song."‎Adam Lanza

2011-12-16‎"Today I dreamt a Columbine reference for the first time. I've probably never had one before because I've scarcely ever cared about Columbine. I began my dream by waking up at age 14 in my extremely dark bedroom during a power outage. I knew that there were ghoulies outside my locked door, roaming around the rest of the house. I tried to get my pocket flashlight to work, but it wasn't consistently staying on. Replacement batteries didn't help, so I instead tried using my backup flashlight: a partially-filled roll of dimes. I spent a while fumbling around with loose dimes, trying to fill up the roll, and eventually ""my brother"" came up to the other side of the locked door. He told me that he needed my help with the ghoulies. I was saying, ""Oh, fuck off. I know you're not my brother. You yourself are one of the ghoulies"", as I was continuing to fumble around trying to fill the roll of dimes. I ended up not having enough dimes to entirely fill it, but at least I had enough for it to give off a dim ray of light. I got out of bed and prepared for a fight with the ghoulies. I went downstairs as my flashlight dream- vanished, but at this point the rest of the house was dimly lit anyway. As I was about to go into the kitchen, a huge purple monster with long arms leapt forth from around a corner and pinned me against a wall. It sort of looked like this: http://www.raukusbaukus.com/images/grap ... ilcher.jpg I realized that it was some student I knew when I was 12. He tried talking to me, and basically said something to the extent of, ""Everyone picked on me for being a huge purple monster, and so now I'm going to go Columbine. I already went to a bunch of other kids' houses to find a partner, but they refused my offer, so I ate them. You're next on the list. Do you want to join me?"". The way it apparently worked was that I could get bitten by him and then choose which form I wanted to be in at will. I thought, why not get bitten by him so I could become a cool purple monster whenever I pleased, and then just use my new monster powers to kill him right after he bites me? So I was like, ""Sure, bro"". He kept trying to bite different parts of me, but it always ended in me whining, ""Ooowwwwww"", he would let go, look at the spot, and say, ""I didn't bite long enough! It didn't work"". We went through this for quite a while, and then I had the thought that, ""You shouldn't just bite me -anywhere-. It should be high up on my arm so people don't see the mark, the same reason why doctors inject patients on their arm (dream logic). He rolled up my sleeve, pointed at my vein, and I said, ""No! Doctors would find out because they inject there, of course! It has to be higher"". He kept pointing to various places as we were walking around the house, but none of them seemed suitable to me. He gradually dream-changed into having an awfully-constructed syringe in his hand with all sorts of bent needles all over it, and I procrastinated by getting him to talk about the music he liked. I had decided at this point that I should just kill him rather than wait to get turned into a cool therianthrope because his needles were really starting to freak me out. Then I realized, ""Hey, if you were feigning my brother's voice, then that means you must have killed him!"" I ran down to the basement as he was assuring me he hadn't done anything, and I saw my brother soundly asleep. I went back up the stairs and saw an opportunity to kill the huge purple monster, seeing as he had transformed into a cardboard box. I shred apart the box as dawn approached while he was complaining about how confusing I was. ""All the other students just screamed at me, but you accepted me, and now what are you doing? You're tearing me apart!"", and I told him to shut up or something like that as I tore apart the last bit of cardboard. My brother walked up the stairs, but it wasn't really him! He had been brainwashed into believing that he was someone else from my childhood, whom I'll call Billy, and he had even been made up to look sort of like him. I asked him who he thought he was, and sure enough he said Billy, and that he was moving away to college. I followed him into the garage, trying to find a way to convince him that he wasn't Billy before it was too late. Once I entered the garage, my nonexistent kindergarten-age sister was blocking my path while crying for some reason. I affectionately embraced her in my arms and tenderly kissed her. She woefully said, ""I don't want you to kiss me"" as her crying got worse. I was annoyed that she had been brainwashed into thinking there was something evil about kissing, so I picked her up and tossed her over the railing into a pile of cardboard boxes several feet below. Heroically getting back to the task at hand, I looked out at the open garage door, where there were all sorts of non-existent relatives assembling outside in the full-blown morning. There was some fictional high-status male family member at the garage door reading from a scroll in his hands. He was giving the eulogy for my ""dead"" brother! There were some assorted people in the garage who were walking toward the outside, and I saw that among them were two pastors. My horror movie experience indicated that pastors help with all sorts of ghoulie problems, so I called them over and explained that my brother wasn't actually dead. They were shocked and agreed to help stop the ceremony. One of them followed me toward the eulogizer, but at this point, the garage was significantly larger and was extremely crowded, to the extent where I couldn't even pass anyone. Everyone stopped walking as they turned to look behind us at someone who was walking forward. It was apparently her birthday, so the only logical thing to do was hum the wedding march. The pastor and I sighed as we hummed with them, waiting for them to move forward again. The song ended, she stopped, and said, ""I'm glad that you're all here today"". Various views of multiple explosions went through my mind, and at the end of it, a third- person overhead stationary view showed some WASPs in a residential park doing all sorts of recreational activities. Text appeared saying, ""At least now there was plenty of space for racquetball"". I realized that I had been watching a YouTube video, part 11/11. I thought, ""Wow, that was a pretty surreal movie. I'm bookmarking this and I'll go back to look at the other parts later"". I woke up in real life and realized that YouTube would remove the videos from their website along with all internet references to them by the time that I managed to get online, so I typed this for posterity."‎Adam Lanza

Well, not anymore! Now they're afraid of me!"""".

2012-02-28‎"""I could go in a hundred different ways with this, but I'll try to make it as entirely relevant to AS55's post as I can, instead of rambling about chimpanzees and who-knows-what-else. Columbine wasn't an isolated incident: it was the apex of a string of school shootings which began increasing with Lu Gang and Wayne Lo in the early 1990s. Despite American students committing fewer school shootings in 2000-2009 than they did in 1990-1999, the rate of attempts actually increased beyond their pre-Columbine level. Columbine caused Americans to begin taking the potential for school shootings seriously, and thus many attempts which were expected to have been carried out have instead been prevented. And since 1999, there has been an increase in foreign school massacres committed in countries where, as Sabratha's Bullet Time phrases it, there isn't the """"operational history"""" of Columbine. In any event, it's myopic to telescope on school shootings when they've comprised a small percentage of the larger trend of mass murders, which are carried out in all sorts of contexts; but they always occur in contexts which involve some permutation of alienation, which has been part and parcel with societal """"progress"""". This relationship can be seen with the Chinese mass stabbings. There were some sparse incidents throughout the 20th century, but the rate began to rise in the 1990s and erupted in the early 2000s, corresponding to China's rapid """"economic development"""", culminating in the infamous spate of elementary school stabbings of 2010. American mass murders were less prevalent before Richard Speck precipitated their rise in 1966. My best estimate for the -absolute- minimum amount of mass murders in the US since 1966 is 960. I would be surprised if there weren't a minimum of somewhere around 1500 in reality, but we'll just vaguely say that there have been over 1000. If you were trying to measure alienation in a society, what could be a more blatant indication? And it's glib to dismiss them as not being indicative of anything just because there have been over a thousand of them instead of over a hundred thousand, or however many you think are necessary, because mass murdering is so ridiculously over-the-top of a response that very few people are prone to do it under any circumstances. But just look at how many fans you can find for all different types of mass murderersâ€""not just the Reb & VoDkA bunch"", and beyond these fans are countless more people who can sympathize with them; and beyond these are millions more who never think of relating the circumstances of their lives to anyone else but instead just go through the motions of life incessantly dissatisfied with their environment. Thinking of this society as the default state of existence is the reason why you think that humans would be """"not well"""" for """"no reason whatsoever"""". Civilization has not been present for 99% of the existence of hominids, and the only way that it's ever sustained is by indoctrinating each new child for years on end. The """"wellness"""" that you speak of is solely defined by a child's submission to this process and their subsequent capacity to propagate civilization themselves. When civilization exists in a form where all forms of alienation (among many other things) are rampant, as can be seen in the most recent incarnation within the last fifty years which AS55 talked about, new children will end up """"not well"""" in all sorts of ways. You don't even have to touch a topic as cryptic as mass murder to see an indication of this: you can look at a single symptom as egregious as the proliferation of antidepressants. And look in your own life. You've said that you're afflicted by unrelenting anxiety and that you're afraid to leave your house. Do you really think that the way you feel is not symptomatic of anything other than your own inexplicable defectiveness? http://www.spunk.org/texts/writers/zerzan/sp001182.txt http://www.spunk.org/texts/writers/zerzan/sp001183.txt"""‎Adam Lanza
‎I sit here all alone. I am always alone. I don’t know who I am. I want to be something I can never be. I try so hard every day. But in the end, I hate myself for what I’ve become. Every single person I know means nothing to me. I hate every person on this earth. I wish they could all go away.The only reason I stay alive is because of hope. Even though I am repulsive and few peopleknow who I am, I still feel that things might, maybe, just a little bit, get better. I don’t understand any fucking person on this earth. Some of you are so weak, mainly, that a four year old could push you down. I am strong, but my head just doesn’t work right. I know I should be happy with what I have, but I hate living. Every time I talk to her, I have a small amount of hope. But then she will tear it right down. It feels like my heart is breaking. But is that possible. I am so consumed with hate all of the time. Could I ever love anyone? I have feelings, but do I have a heart that’s not black and full of animosity? I know everyone thinks this way sometimes, but I am so full of rage that I feel I could snap at any moment. I think about it everyday. Blowing the school up or just taking the easy way out, and walk into a pep assembly with guns. In either case, people that are breathing will stop breathing. That is how I will repay all you mother fuckers for all you put me through. I feel like everyone is against me, but no one ever makes fun of me, mainly because they think I am a psycho. There is one kid above all others that I want to kill. I want nothing more than to put a hole in his head. The one reason I don’t: Hope. That tomorrow will be better. As soon as my hope is gone, people die. I ask myself why I hate more than anyone else. I don’t know. But my head and heart want him dead. He only knows who I am through reputation, and I know he is scared of me. He should be. One bad day, and there will be a sawed off shotgun in his face or five pounds of Semtex under his bed. I need help. There is one person that could help, but she won’t. I need to find someone else. I think I love her, but she could never love me. I don’t know why I try. Oh fuck. I sound so pitiful. People would laugh at this if they read it. I hate being laughed at. But they won’t laugh after they’re scraping parts of their parents, sisters, brothers, and friends from the wall of my hate. Please. Someone, help me. All I want is something small. Nothing big. I just want to be happy. End. New day. Today of all days, I ask her to help me. I was shot down. I feel like my heart has been ripped open and ripped apart. Right now, I’m drunk, so I don’t know what the hell is happening to me. It is clear that no one will help me. Oh God, I am so close to killing people. So close. I gave her all I have, and she just threw it away. Why? Why did God just want me to be in complete misery? I need to find more weapons. My parents are trying to take away some of my guns! My guns are the only things that haven’t stabbed me in the back. My eyes hurt. They hurt so bad. They feel like they are trying to crawl out of my head. Why aren’t I normal? Help me. No one will. I will kill every last mother fucking one of you. The thought of you is still racing in my head. I am too drunk to make sense. Every time I see your face, my heart is shot with an arrow. I think she will say yes, but she doesn’t, does she? She says, “I don’t know”. The three most fucked up words in the English language. I want you to feel this, be this, taste this, kill this. Kill me. Oh God, I don’t want to live. Will I see it to the end? What kind of dad would I make? All humans are evil. I just want to end the world of evil. I don’t want to see, hear, speak or feel evil, but I can’t help it. I am evil. I want to kill and give pain without a cost. And there is no such thing. We kill him — we killed him a long time ago. Anyone that believes in God is a fucking sheep. If there was a God, he wouldn’t let me feel the way I do . . . Love isn’t real, only hate remains. Only hate.‎Kip Kinkel

‎No, I don’t believe in love at first sight because love is an evil plot to make people buy alcohol and firearms. When you love someone something it is always taken away from you. I also would like to add that I hate each and every one of you. Because everything I touch turns to shit. I think if you think you fall in love with someone at first sight it might just be lust. Love at first sight is only in movies. Where the people in the movies are better than you. That is why you go to a pone shop and buy an AR-15 because you are going to execute every last mother fucking one of you. If I had a heart it would be gray. It is easier to hate than love. Because there is much more hate and misery in the world than there is love and peace. Some people say that you should love everyone. But that is impos- sible. Look at our history it is full of death, depression, rape, wars and diseases. I also do not believe in love at first sight. But I do believe in hate at first sight. Therefore love is a much harder feeling to experience. I really wouldn’t know how to answer this question because my cold black heart has never and never will experience true love. I can tell you one about love. It does more harm than good. I plan to live in a big black hole. My firearms and will be the only things to fight my isolation. I would also like to point out Love is a horrible thing. It makes things kill and hate.‎Kip Kinkel
‎I have just killed my parents! I don’t know what is happening. I love my mom and dad so much. I just got two felonies on my record. My parents can’t take that! It would destroy them. The embarrassment would be too much for them. They couldn’t live with themselves. I’m so sorry. I am a horrible son. I wish I had been aborted. I destroy everything I touch. I can’t eat. I can’t sleep. I didn’t deserve them. They were wonderful people. It’s not their fault or the fault of any person, organization, or television show. My head just doesn’t work right. God damn these VOICES inside my head. I want to die. I want to be gone. But I have to kill people. I don’t know why. I am so sorry! Why did God do this to me. I have never been happy. I wish I was happy. I wish I made my mother proud. I am nothing! I tried so hard to find happiness. But you know me I hate everything. I have no other choice. What have I become? I am so sorry‎Kip Kinkel
‎I have spent days trying to figure out what I want to say. I have crumpled up dozens of pieces of paper and disregarded even more ideas. I have thought about what I could say that might make people feel just a little bit better. But I have come to the realization that it really doesn’t matter what I say. Because there is nothing I can do to take away any of the pain and destruction I have caused. I absolutely loved my parents and had no reason to kill them. I had no reason to dislike, kill or try to kill anyone at Thurston. I am truly sorry that this has happened. I have gone back in my mind hundreds of times and changed one detail, one small event so this never would have happened. I wish I could. I take full responsibility for my ac- tions. These events have pulled me down into a state of deterioration and self-loathing that I didn’t know existed. I am very sorry for everything I have done, and for what I have become.‎Kip Kinkel
‎But you know me, I loathe all of them. I am no longer blind in my hatred, I can see with my hate. Blood will flow until they are all dead. This was the first moment in my life where I had taken the life of another. I loved it. It dispelled all the anger and animosity I was feeling.‎Kip Kinkel

2004-03-19‎"Thank you. What brings me to the forum? Well, I stumbled across the site in my study of the Third Reich as well as Nazism, amongst other things. I guess I've always carried a natural admiration for Hitler and his ideals, and his courage to take on larger nations. I also have a natural dis-like for communism. When I was growing up, I was taught (like others) that Nazi's were (are) evil and that Hitler was a very evil man ect... Of course, not for a second did I believe this. Upon reading up on his actions, the ideals and issues the German Third Reich adressed, I began to see how much of a lie had been painted about them. They truly were doing it for the better. It kind of angers me how people pass pre-judgement on someone if they even so much as say something like ""I support what Hitler did,"" without even hearing what you have to say. This goes double if you're ethnic. I also hear things like, ""oh he had syphilis, he was crazy and thats why he did what he did."" Or, ""he molested his neice,"" it's easy to see that even today people are trying to destroy the image of a man who deserves great respect..."‎Jeffrey Weise

By the way, I'm being blamed for a threat on the school I attend because someone said they were going to shoot up the school on 4/20, Hitlers birthday, and just because I claim being a National Socialist, guess whom they've pinned?‎Jeffrey Weise
2004-05-26‎"You encounter a lot of hostility when you claim to be a National Socialist, but because of my size and appearance people don't give me as much trouble as they would if looked weak. I already had a fist-fight with a communist not to long ago over me being what I am (I also won), but it was worth it. I don't try to hide what I am from anyone, if they're going to start something over it then fine, I'm not backing down; Nor am I hiding. I try not to be aggressive in most situations, I'll use force if have to, but I'm not about to go out and pick a fight, I'm mostly defensive, I'll defend myself if someone tries something but other than that I'm a peaceful person. But the school threat passed and I was cleared as a suspect, I'm glad for that. I don't much care for jail, I've never been there and I don't plan on it. Either way, I was wondering if there was a way to become a more active member, besides posting on this board I can't really think of anything else to do. I could do some recruiting, but a lot of the people I socialize with are against Nazism whole-heartedly, I managed to sway a few opinions in the favor of the movement none the less, and there is also a few of my ""friends"" who only like Hitler because they think Nazi's are ""cool."" Which I agree with, don't get me wrong, but they aren't as serious about it as am. Any ideas? I may young, but I'm willing to help."‎Jeffrey Weise
2004-07-19‎"Apparently a lot of people have never heard of a Native American National Socialist, which surprises me. I think most people on this Reservation would respond well to the racial question if it was disguised. For example, if I asked your average teenager on this reservation: ""Are you proud to be Native?"" The answer I would get is, ""hell yeah dawg."" Now for some reason, I would find myself asking ""if you're so proud to be Native, then why do you walk, talk, act, and dress like an African American?"" But I always refrain from doing so. The only one's who oppose my views are the teachers at the high school, and a large portion of the student body who think a Nazi is a Klansman, or a White Supremacist thug. Most of the Natives I know have been poisoned by what they were taught in school. The basic ""Nazi = Bad, Jew = Good. Defend Jew at all costs."" You get the idea, the public school system has done more harm then good, and as a result it has left many on this reservation misled and misinformed. But you are right about us Natives having a lot of pride in our heritage. I own my share of ""Native Pride"" shirts and sweaters, and I see many more in school, yet they are still outnumbered by your basic Rap culture paraphernalia. I haven't given too much thought to the way our land would be divided or how it would work, so thanks for bringing it up. What ways has the Jewish power affected us in General? Ever since the Jewish post-war propaganda has been taught in our school systems (on reservations), a lot have been brainwashed into thinking purity is wrong, at least that's my take on it. I can't help but notice how many pure blooded Natives there are left since... Sorry if I didn't answer some of the questions in the ways you had hoped, but I'm a little tired right now. I'd be happy to field anymore questions you may have for me though."‎Jeffrey Weise
2004-07-20‎"Anymore Native American NS's? Not right now, though I'm thinking of recruiting a few for the party once school starts up again. About the wannabe's, call them ""n-iggers,"" since technically that's what they are. Native - Iggers, though I tend not to use the term so much in public for obvious reasons. Right now I know about two people on the Rez who share my beliefs, but they don't share them entirely. The teachers at my school are all white (besides the Ojibwe language teacher), yet the times have brought up that Native Women and Black men, or White women and Native men shouldn't be together to keep their blood pure, I've been called a racist. When I bring up the point that our tribe (the Ojibwe) is mixed a lot and is in need of more pure bloods, I get the same old argument which seems to be so common around here. ""We need to mix all the races, to combine all the strengths..."" ect ect. It gets old real quick when you hear the same argument over and over. They (teachers) don't openly say that racial purity is wrong, yet when you speak your mind on the subject you get ""silenced"" real quick by the teachers and likeminded school officials..."‎Jeffrey Weise

2004-05-13‎"They pegged me as a possible school shooter earlier this year, or wait, that was last month. Apparently someone was supposed to shoot up the school on 4/20, and there was alot of buzz around me, and for good reasons I guess. I wear combat boots (with my pant legs tucked into them), wear a trench coat, and at the last basketball game my friend Mac, (who happens to wear a black trench coat like mine), did a ""Sieg Hell"" during the national anthem (for shock value), so they had us pegged as ""Trench Coat Mafia."" My ""friend"" Rose even said that I fit the profile of a school shooter that she saw on 60 minutes. They also pinned it on me because 4/20 happens to be Adolf Hitlers birthday, and I seem to be the only one who promotes National Socialist beliefs (not the stereotypical ""White Power"" bs you hear racists shouting, either). So it's not hard to label a school shooter. I happen to be ""not so popular,"" Gothic (in the sense that I wear nothing but black, spike my hair in ""devil"" horns, and listen to music like Cradle of Filth and KoRn), and happen to be an emotionally disturbed person, if you could call me that. So it's really no problem slapping a label on someone because they fit the stereotype. And no, I wasn't the one who did the threat. On ""Game day"" (4/20) the Feds were all around the place, watching, cop cars on nearly every corner around the school and a few large unmarked black vans sitting around, I bet they were on standby. So they WERE prepared for something to happen.

2004-11-08‎"The White Owl I wasn't sure what Forum to post this in, because it confuses me alot and has me wondering, but I'll take a guess and post it here in the Paranormal forum. A few months ago, when I was on my way back from the Theif River mental health clinic after a suicide attempt, I saw something that I thought was severely out of place. 1.) It was an Owl, sitting in plain site in the brush near the road, I saw him/her clearly, and to boot it was White. A White Owl in the middle of the day sitting next to the road. I didn't think too much about it till about two months later, I asked my grandmother about it. She told me a story that scared the scheisse out of me. She said, one time when her and a friend were on there way from somewhere (I forget, since it's not really that important of a detail), her friend saw an Owl in the middle of the day during their drive. They were on their way to the casino, she said her friend mentioned the Owl to her but neither paid any attention to it. They were sitting in the casino playing their favourite game when my grandmothers friend (same one who had witnessed the Owl), fell the to the ground. She had had a heart attack, long story short she didn't make it. Period. Now when I heard this, I must've looked like a carton of milk I was so white from fear. ""That was the only expierience I ever had with an Owl being seen during the day,"" she said. I always heard seeing an Owl during daytime was an Omen of some sort, since Owls are a night bird, but doing some research on the net I didn't find out what exactly they are an omen for, but rather, that they have always (for the most part) been associated with evil forces. Now I posted this here to hopefully gain some insite from the more spirtually affluent peoples of the board. I want to know: am I screwed? What does the Omen mean. And, should I be worried? Any help would be greatly appreciated, as I'm still worried over this whole thing... Any help would be greatly appreciated."‎Jeffrey Weise
2004-11-08‎Would you please try to be a little bit more considerate? I had went through alot of things in my life that had driven me to a darker path than most choose to take. I split the flesh on my wrist with a box opener, painting the floor of my bedroom with blood I shouldn't have spilt. After sitting there for what seemed like hours (which apparently was only minutes), I had the revelation that this was not the path.. It was my dicision to seek medical treatment, as on the other hand I could've chose to sit there until enough blood drained from my downward lascerations on my wrists to die. I am now on Anti-depressants, and just because you've probably never been through anything Like I have doesn't give you the write to say what you have.

2003-12-24‎"Surviving the Dead This is the first in a 3 part series, tell me what you think. Warning: Readers Discretion Is Advised. ""Surviving the Dead."" 1 The small town of Grovers Mill sat somewhere East, nearly forgotten by all except those who lived there. It was after eleven and dark as most stormy night's are, rain hammered down on the town relentlessly accompanied by it's usual acquaintances thunder and lightening. It's dull barren street's were completely void of anything living, all the shop's had closed for the night and everyone was in their warm bed's dreaming simple dreams. The shadowy figure stood on the outskirt's of the town's eastern border looking from side to side making sure it was clear, the black storm poncho kept his black jumpsuit and tactical gear safe from the rain. He tilted the cap of his black battle helmet upwards so that he could see better, seeing the coast was clear he shifted his M-16 to his right hand and brought up his flashlight pointing it down the opposite direction of the road flicking it off and on twice. In the distance through the falling rain a pair of headlight's flicked on after seeing his signal, the man put his flash light away and took the M-16 into both arm's once again as the truck slowly started to drive forward. The truck came to a rustic stopped near the town's morgue, a one story tall concrete monstrosity with a freshly mowed lawn with lush green grass looking almost fake. From the passengers side another man jumped out dressed in the same manner as the signaler had been. The looming military figure removed his talk box from his tactical belt and pressed down the talk button, speaking a single word. ""Mask's."" Hearing him over the radio the driver pulled a gas mask up from the floor of the truck and quickly put it on, those on the military hummer that had escorted the transport truck slid their mask's on too. The passenger from the transport truck slid on his gas mask moving towards the back of the truck, he climbed onto the bed and removed a single barrel, he set it down on the wet concrete and looked for the keypad somewhere on it's top. He punched in a four digit code on the keypad attached to the barrel and with a loud pop the top opened releasing a plume of yellow smoke, quickly he moved to the front of the truck jumping into the passenger's side. He picked up the CB radio, ""GO GO GO!,"" his tone was frantic and frightened. The transport truck quickly backed out of the morgue parking lot and sped off towards the western exit followed by it's escort. Unbeknownst to the townsfolk ""Operation Paperclip"" had just begun... Max's tired eye's fell upon the cliché maroon brick school as he stepped off the trademark yellow bus, he let out a sigh and started towards the entrance. He surrendered his black book bag to the ape like security guard named Ben and took anything metal out of his pockets, (a set of key's and a CD player), and stepped through the metal detector. It buzzed as it went off, he let out a sigh. ""I don't have anything,"" said Max annoyed. Ben pulled open the drawer of the metal desk he sat behind and pulled up a hand held metal detector, he moved around the desk and Max assumed the position. He put his arm's up as if he was reaching for the sky, Ben waved the ""wand"" all around him, when it didn't beep he simply said, ""go on."" Max let out a sigh, even for a small town the security was tight. He ""hated that, after the school shooting's like Columbine and Cold Spring's they had stepped up the security at the front door, Max grabbed his stuff off the desk and started towards the Canteen where he and his friend's hung out. ""Hey,"" Max said to the other's as he walked in. A few of them were already talking and barely acknowledged him, a few nodded their hello's and one actually returned his greeting. He took a seat in the corner on an aluminum folding chair plopping his back pack down next to him. The canteen was small, very small, yet he and his six friend's still used it as their main ""headquarters."" It was there's pretty much, it would've been if it didn't belong to the school. Max looked at the watch on his wrist, ""8:01 AM,"" 14 minutes till first class. ""What did you do last night?,"" asked Mike. The question came so quickly it almost knocked Max off his chair, ""uh... Nothing really. Listened to music, watched a movie... that's about it."" Mike nodded and sat down on the chair next to Max, ""cool... I went to see Cher again."" Cher was Mikes girlfriend who lived 10 miles away at the next town, he had met her at the last basketball game when the school's ""Wolverines"" faced their ""Badger's."" It had been a slaughter, Badger's won twenty to nothing, Max had lost ten dollar's on that game. Either way, Mike had been bragging about her for ages, though Max had half the mind to tell him she wasn't much to brag about... But he couldn't do that, Mike was his best friend, and they'd probably end up throwing punches over it. Before either could speak another word the bell rang, 14 minutes only seemed like a couple second's when Max thought about it. He stood up slinging his backpack over his shoulder, ""see ya""."" Mike nodded as everyone exited the canteen, Mrs. Silver, (the librarian), closed the Canteen's door and locked it as everyone was trying to get in to by a pop at the last minute. First class was always a pain for Max, Mr. Reinhardt's class, he had his mustache shaved like Adolf Hitler, even had the same hair style, which made everyone uncomfortable and nervous around him. A few of the kid's had complained about it to the principle, but nothing came of it. ""Now class, open your text book's open to page 420,"" said Mr. Reinhardt, he taught American Civics, not really Max's favorite subject either, since he planned on moving to England when he turned 18. ""CODE RED! CODE RED!,"" came over the intercom, a few gasp's and ""oh my god's"" came from some of the class. Mr. Reinhardt quickly ran over to the door and locked it, ""class move to the back of the room!"" No one argued, most rushed to the back of the room, Max didn't have to, he was already there. ""Code Red"" had been discussed a lot by the teachers, Max had been growing sick of it. Code red was what would be said over the intercom if someone entered the building with a gun, teacher's were supposed to lock their classroom door's and move all student's to the back of the room. So far so good. ""Now kid's stay calm,"" said Mr. Reinhardt who sounded as if he was about to pass a stone. Max wasn't really afraid for his life like most of the other student's probably were, the only thing running through his mind was ""the school had it coming."" He couldn't help but wonder if he knew the shooter, maybe it was Ray, he hadn't shown up that morning... The class was quiet, too quiet, Max could hear a few whimper's and someone sobbing but that was it. Most were probably waiting to hear a gunshot, Max knew that's what he was waiting for. He hoped it wasn't a stupid drill, though as time passed he would wish it had been. In the distance, somewhere else in the school, the sound of a blood curdling scream echoed through the hallway's. Max nearly jumped out of his seat when he heard it, fear was setting in now. He had heard plenty of scream's in his sixteen year's of life but never anything like that, it was a cry. A death cry. ""Jesus,"" the word had escaped Max's mouth too quick for him to stifle it. ""Jesus had nothing to do with that, son,"" Mr. Reinhardt said in a cold emotionless tone. ""That was the devil's work."" The word's sent a chill down Max's spine as he thought about them, then again another scream broke the silence, the sound of shattering glass and the sound's of a man screaming in agony were all too real. Max closed his eye's trying to take his mind off of now, he would've given anything to be elsewhere. That's when the pounding started. The classroom door began to shake, with each strike every person in the classroom shook. The moaning started shortly after, bone chilling moan's of hunger. The strength and pace of the strikes began to quicken, there was now more than one person trying to get in. ""Don't worry kid's,"" said Mr. Reinhardt. ""That door's solid reinforced steel, they're not going to get in."" Whatever held the door in place was now starting to bend, soon the door was nearly flying open with each strike. The collective fear in the room could be felt strongly by all. The door was struck once more, finally swinging open in submission. Max's eye's snapped open as he heard the door strike the wall, in shambled two men. The first was tall, dressed in a suit. A burial suit. It's face had been caked with make up, some of which had been washed away near the mouth by blood, his eye's had sunken deep into the socket's and were surrounded by black ring's. The second was Ben, the security guard, or what was left of him. His throat had been ripped out, replaced by a bloody mass of torn tissue, crimson had drenched his blue work shirt below the neck. A white foam dripped from the sides of his mouth which hung open loosely. The site of both men sent the room into chaos. One of the student's shattered one of the classroom window's with a chair and climbed out, other's took his cue and did the same. Max climbed out one of the window's, turning back just in time to see Mr. Reinhardt being tackled to the floor by both men. Max had cut his hand as he climbed out the window, but he didn't even care, the adrenaline helped him ignore the pain and soldier on, he ran for the mass of police car's that had gathered by the front of the school. He looked at the front of the building, two men dressed in tactical gear stood cautiously by the front entrance while another evacuated student's who came out quickly with their hand's atop their head's. ""How many were in there? Can you tell me?,"" asked a police officer as a paramedic bandaged Max's hand. Max remained silent, he had no answer. He would've spoken if he had something to say. The officer moved on to another student to ask the same question like a mindless automaton. ""Max,"" said a female voice. Max looked up, it was one of his friend's, Morticia, he finally broke his silence. ""Hey..."" ""Oh my God are you ok?,"" she asked seeing his bandage. Mike was standing next to her, ""damn man. Did you get shot?"" ""There wasn't a gun...,"" ""Huh?,"" asked Mike. Max mumbled. Max shook his head. ""Nothin'... I cut my hand climbing out that window over there."" The sound of gunfire made Max jumped, he turned his head towards the school where it was coming from. ""They ain't goin' down!,"" someone said over the radio, Max could hear it from the cop standing next to the ambulance. More gunfire came from inside the school, the three police officer's in tactical gear near the front door's began to run as they saw something inside, more rain began to fall from the gray sky. Max sat unmoving on the back of the ambulance watching, the rain wetting his black pant's and shoes. Out of the front entrance came another officer dressed in black tactical gear as the other's running, four people chased after him, as he ran he unholstered his Colt M1911.45. He turned and fired two shot's point blank into one of his pursuers but to no avail. The bullet's did nothing, the person chasing him merely jerked a few times then tackled the fleeing officer. No one could do anything but watch in horror as the man's throat was tore out by human teeth, his blood flowed mixing with fallen rain in a steady stream down to a gutter than into a storm drain. ""Cannibal's...,"" Max heard someone say. Max had come to a conclusion that only time would prove right or wrong. These ""cannibal's"" weren't living, but dead. It was beyond him where the conclusion came from, maybe his subconscious had pieced it together. Maybe not. ""Drop 'em!,"" was the order that came over the police radio. Gunfire erupted from the police who had their gun's trained on the four creatures. Bullet's tore through them as they feasted on the police officer's body, trained gun's and sighted rifles blew them back to hell, where they belonged. ""Cease fire,"" Max could hear the order over the police officer's radio who stood next to the ambulance. Unnerved taw enforcement lowered their gun's, then slowly the four creatures rose to their feet... Along with the police officer they had killed. Max's eye's widened, total shock and awe. The undead creatures began to run at the living with only one thing on their minds: Food...."‎Jeffrey Weise
2003-12-29‎"Suriving the Dead Warning: Readers Discretion Is Advised. -2- The entire town had already succumbed to the rank's of the mass murder and carnage committed by the ravenous ""human's,"" who seemed to be in a trance like state. The phenomenon had ravaged the town, spreading quickly like a wild fire in dry brush, Morticia and Max had seen a lifetimes worth of violence in just the first hour since the ""crisis"" had started in their small town. ""Come on!,"" Morticia shouted pulling Max along the long alley way. Max ran as fast as he could, though it was still not fast enough for the things were gaining on him. His soaked shoes sloshed each time his foot pressed down on the wetted concrete, his clothes were soaked as well from the rain that seemed to never stop. The overhanging gray storm cloud's seemed to cast a gray hue over everything, for everything seemed a duller color than it really was. ""Come on!,"" Morticia shouted again. Max heard her, but here was little he could do. She was faster then him, and it seemed so were the creatures that pursued them. ""Over here!,"" a voice ahead of them shouted. Both Max and Morticia could hear it over the sound of raindrop's hitting various thing's. Ahead of them was a man, one who looked as if he wasn't a day over 20, standing dressed in black BDUs, a matching cap on his head, soaked from head to toe. In his right hand he held a large rifle, like something out of an Arnold Schwarzenegger film. ""Hurry!,"" he continued. Morticia and Max quickened their pace, running with renewed purpose. Max glanced over his shoulder as he ran seeing a site that encouraged him to go faster, the site of the snarling human monstrosities reaching out after him with ravenous claws. He reached the man standing at the end of the alley a few step's after Morticia, every inch of his being filled with absolute fear. The stranger with the gun looked ahead of him as the two frightened teenager's rushed past him, three of the creatures in hot pursuit, hell bent on acquiring yet another hot meal. The first to reach the end of the alley was met with a swift and deadly blow to the skull from the stock of the stranger's rifle. The second one doubled over as a 5.56mm slug tore through it's forehead, exiting through the back of it's skull blowing much of it away. The third's knee's were blown out from under it with two expertly placed shot's, the heroic stranger stepped forward looking down upon the horrific creature with disgust. It's head cracked open like a melon under his black combat boot, he gave another stern kick to the merely destroyed skull for good measure. Max had nearly crashed to the ground from exhaustion while Morticia on the other hand was fairing well, she leaned against a brick wall taking in as much oxygen as she could. Max hadn't been built for running like Morticia had. The stranger dressed in black checked the creatures, to make sure that they were truly dead, before turning to the two shaken teenagers. ""You two kid's alright?,"" the stranger asked, his voice was filled with something that wasn't quite concern, but wasn't quite anything else. Max simply nodded his reply. Morticia had finished catching her breath and looked at the mysterious stranger before asking, ""who are you?"" ""Lieutenant 1st Class Edward Hawkins, at your service,"" he replied in a polished tone. The stranger, who had identified himself as Edward Hawkins, looked at Morticia noticing her slightly unusual attire, wearing all black clothes in an unusual style he had never seen. Her counterpart max was the same, dressed in complete black garb with a chain hanging from his left back pocket attached to one of his belt loop's, his wet hair which looked like it had once been in spikes that had been destroyed by the bombarding rain. He was a little less stringy then the girl, but that was only to be expected. ""Now may I ask who you two are?,"" he asked casually. ""I'm Morticia and that's Max,"" she replied snappily. ""But my friend's call my Morty, since Morticia is too long."" ""Where'd you come from?,"" asked Max, he was a little uneasy around this ""Edward."" ""Recon element, second SS, I was separated from my squad a few block's from here when we ran into these,"" he paused thinking about it for a second, "". thing's."" ""SS?"" Max gave him a curious look. The Lieutenant replied almost on cue, ""Slayer Squad."" To Max the name sounded like something out of a low B-grade movie of the 80s, or rather like something from a video game. ""So I take it you're military,"" said Morticia, looking at him untrustingly. Edward gave a quick nod, ""yes. This whole area's an I.Z."" ""I.Z.?,"" asked Max curiously. This was all so new to him, though the Lieutenant seemed more comfortable with it. ""Infected Zone,"" the Lieutenant said again in a polished tone, sounding more like a brainwashed automaton from the cheerfulness of his nature. ""We should probably get a move on, find a place to hide until help comes, the shot's I fired will undoubtedly bring more of the creatures."" Neither Max or Morticia voiced any disagreement with the lieutenant's idea, they followed him willingly like obedient lap dogs. The three had taken refuge in a small corner coffee shop, the Lieutenant had secured the place with the top's of tables and other assorted wooden item's that could be nailed across opening's. Luckily the owner of the place had kept a healthy supply of nail's in the pantry. The rain continued to fall from the heavens outside, it filled the air with it's unusually fresh scent that would've been welcomed happily any other day. But not that day; for it was truly the day of the dead. ""So, Lieutenant Hawkins... What're you really here for?,"" Morticia asked him as she sat on a bar stool she had frequented regularly, sipping a random cold cup of coffee. The lieutenant sat with his back to her and Max checking his gun's, an M4 Carbine and a Beretta 9mm pistol, facing the front door which had been boarded up from the inside. ""I'm sorry, but I cannot disclose that information."" His tone had been monotonous, noticeably different from when he had spoken before. Morticia rolled her eye's as she looked at him, ""are you serious? We're in the middle of something like this, most likely going to die, and you can't tell us a single thing?"" ""We're not going to die,"" said Max who had become unusually quiet, though he never had never really been a talker for the year's Morticia had known him. And that was kindergarten through present. Morticia had never been a pessimist, but she seemed to be doing well at it. ""We're going to end up just like Mike."". Max closed his eye's thinking about what happened to Mike, then tried to shift his mind onto something else since the thought was too painful, tear's began to streak down his cheek's as he silently wept. ""No, he's right,"" said the Lieutenant. ""We're not going to die."" He knew it was a lie, but false hope was all he could give. Morticia's eye's darted around the coffee shop, all window's had been effectively and sufficiently boarded up to keep the thing's out, though they hadn't found the three survivor's yet, but there was no doubt in her mind that they would. She looked at the lieutenant who kept a watchful eye on the door. ""Where'd you learn to do this stuff? Like the... nailing, and all that jazz..."" ""Basic training for all in the SS, securing a perimeter to effectively stave off the 'U.D.' is one of the most invaluable skill's I was taught,"" replied the Lieutenant. ""W-wait, 'U.D.,' what's that?,"" Morticia asked. The lieutenant was silent for a few second's before replying. ""Undead."" Morticia nearly choked on the drink of the cold coffee she took when she heard him, she spit it out and gasped for air. ""Undead?!"" ""Told ya',"" said Max who sat behind the counter hugging his knee's to his chest. ""You mean, those thing's out there, they're already dead?!,"" she had thought Max was only making thing's up, lies caused by fear and an inability to explain what had been occurring. ""Affirmative. The only way to deal with one of the U.D. is to destroy the brain,"" the Lieutenant spoke as if it were all normal. ""This is merely a training exercise, one I've been long preparing for."" Morticia asked no more questions, the shocking information provided by the Lieutenant was enough to make her wish she'd never asked. She was afraid to ask anything else now, scared of what she might be told. I don't need this, she thought. I'm only a kid still, I want to live, I want to live... Max remained silent, what had started as a regular day had turned into a blood bath for the ages, one he would not soon forget. The air seemed to be alive with a sort of ""electric"" feeling, Max could smell it as well as feel it slightly. Mixed in with the scent of the rain that continued to poor as if God was crying was barely noticeable. Max closed his eye's, thinking of his house. His nice little house on Gorman ST where he and his mom and dad lived, and his dog Chopper. He wanted to be home, in bed, he wanted to wake up and find that this had all been a bad dream. He wanted to wake up and find that this had all been an elaborate nightmare, cooked up by his subconscious from eating the wrong thing's and watching horror movies before bed. He pinched himself to reassure himself that this wasn't a dream, a nightmare, but reality. Cold harsh merciless reality. He pondered on his loved ones, and his friend's he hadn't seen since the school that morning, wondering if they were ok. He began to doubt that he would ever see them again, that he would ever wake up Saturday morning's to the smell of his is mother making breakfast, since she never had the time during week day's because of work. Saturday's were always special, more tear's began to well up in his eye's as he realized he would never see another Saturday morning. Morticia had the same feeling's, she wanted to be home, listening to music and drawing as she usually did out of boredom. She wanted to hear her Evanescence CD once more, she had forgotten it that morning on her dresser. But it wouldn't have been of much good use, since her CD player ran out of battery's that morning. She wanted to see her cat again, she wanted to hold Boot's once more and pet him. Hear and feel him purring in her arm's affectionately. She wanted to argue with her mother about thing's that weren't really important, only now had she come to the realization that she and her mother never really talked. Arguing was their form of communication, the argument's were never anger filled, they were the only way the two knew how to talk. She realized now, now that it was too late, that she wanted to have a regular conversation with her mother. She lowered her head in sadness, knowing that that would never happen. ""Morticia...,"" said Max from behind the counter, still sitting in his spot hugging his knee's to his chest. ""Yeah?,"" she asked. ""How are you feeling?,"" Max sat silently waiting for her reply. ""I'm alright... How about you?"" Max wiped away his tear's, ""I'm alright... I've been better though."" The pain was present in his voice, though he tried to hide it. ""Better? Like that time in 8th grade when we spit in Mr. Nilbog's coffee, and he came back from the office and took a big drink?,"" said Morticia with a grin, recalling happier times. Max closed his eye's, laughter coming from him as he remembered that day with crystal clarity. ""And,"" he paused. ""That time Tex McCormick came to school without any pant's on, and no one told him till 1st hour when he walked into Misses Liz's class wearing nothing but a muscle shirt and tighty whiteys."" Morticia slapped her knee, nearly hurting with laughter now. ""How about that time when we put Clearsol in Mikes pop in 3rd hour, and he started farting all wickedly?"" Tear's were coming from both their eye's now, but they were tear's of joy, tear's from their laughter. Max grinned, ""I remember that, he had to go home and c-change his pant's and underwear 'cause of the stuff gave him the Hershey squirt's."" Mortica started to laugh again, ""y-yeah, and Allison Cordaine broke up with him after that 'cause she was embarrassed to be seen with him... We were mean,"" she paused. ""Good times... good times..."" The two were both indeed weird, each one of a kind. But that was part of the reason they got along so well..."‎Jeffrey Weise
2004-01-02‎"-3- Something struck the front door of the coffee shop with great force, shaking the entire building, the door nearly flew off the hinges from the first strike. ""Jesus!,"" Morticia said frightened by it, she hopped over the counter landing next to Max. Both crouched low, peeking over the edge of the counter. ""Stay down kid's, if those thing's get in here I want you both to lock yourselves in the pantry,"" said the lieutenant standing with his M4 at the ready, pointing it at the door way as inhuman moan's came from outside. The glass window's shattered as discoloring hand's shot through the openings between the boards, finger's curling and uncurling hungrily, reaching for whatever was inside. With each strike the door weakened, the boards nailed across coming loose. Lieutenant Hawkins undid the button to the leather strap that held his pistol in it's holster, just in case he had to draw it quickly. Lieutenant Hawkins drew in a deep breath and exhaled slowly, calming his nerves like he had been trained to. He had to remained focused, there was no telling how many of the thing's had accumulated outside, he should've told the kid's to keep quiet, their voices were like a dinner bell to the undead. But he hadn't, he wanted them to enjoy their final hour's as the living. Another devastating blow came to the door, the lieutenant knew it wouldn't be able to take much more. Another strike was delivered knocking a door hinge loose, the lieutenant's eye's narrowed as his hand impatiently wrapped around the pistol grip of the M4, a weird feeling in his stomach developed, his index finger curled around the trigger as he waited anxiously. Another coordinated strike was delivered to the wooden door knocking three of the four board's nailed across it off, hardened fist's knocked away the table top that had been nailed across the doors window sending it to the shop's tiled floor. Through the exposed window the three survivor's could see a sea of dead faces, expression's of hunger and pain on all. Some had suffered vicious wound's to the skull that had not finished them, Max could see one pour soul missing an eye and a jaw. Morticia caught a glimpse of one who's face had been torn away, the flesh and muscles eaten away down to the surface of the bone. She turned around and dry heaved, Max looked away too, he couldn't bare the sight of them. Another strike tore the door from the frame tipping it like a tree, before the first could enter the lieutenant had already started firing. He took his shot's carefully yet quickly, the roar of his M4 mixed in with the chorus of the undead moan's was a hellish anthem of carnage and torment. Yet still, for each one the lieutenant shot another took it's place, his gun clicked empty and before he could draw his pistol they were on him, the first tackled him to the tile floor, his unsecured pistol slid out of it's holster towards the counter landing close to the two teenagers. A few of the reanimated corpses noticed Morticia and Max and started towards them, though some were slower than other's, rigor mortis had set in, Max scooped up the Beretta 9mm in his left hand as he and Morty fled to the pantry. The thick metal pantry door slammed shut just as the first corpse arrived, bouncing off the solid steel surface clumsily. The two teenager's sat in the rather large pantry, still breathing heavily from fear. All Max could do was stare at the door, it looked similar to the one of Mr. Reinhardt's classroom, the one that had given way so easily to so little of the dead. ""What now?,"" asked Morticia. Max looked in her direction, though neither could see each other for the pantry was dark. ""I don't know... I... I really don't..."" A light clicked on in the room, Morticia had found a light switch, the two looked at one another, each expecting the other to know the answer. They could hear the sound's of the lieutenant screaming in pain outside, though neither paid him any attention. So selfish. The pounding on the door could faintly be heard as well as the moan's, the thick wall's as well as the door kept almost all sound from reaching the two. Max looked at the black Beretta in his hands, he had never held a gun his entire life before now. It wasn't at all like the movies, the gun was definitely heavier then he would have expected, and strangely cold, like a block of ice. He didn't know much about gun's, only that you pointed it at whatever you wanted to die and pulled the trigger. ""Wait,"" said Morticia as she moved a box out of the way near the door. Max looked up, ""huh?"" ""There's something here, some kind of hatch,"" she said now on her knee's pulling at something. Max climbed to his feet and walked over, looking over her shoulder just as she pulled whatever it was up. It came open with a strange noise as musty air was released into the pantry. ""Yuck, smell's like."" ""Sewer,"" Max finished her sentence. ""This might be our only way out."" She looked at him with her icy blue eye's. ""Well what are you waiting for?"" He shrugged his shoulders. What did he have to lose? He tucked the pistol into his kangaroo pocket on his black hoodie and started his slow descension by mean's of the rusty cold bar's that were mounted to the concrete sewer wall. The last two bar's were missing, he was forced to drop the rest of the way, which wasn't that far. He landed with both feet evenly, the grayish green sewer water knee high, some of it splashed upwards getting on his hooded sweater as he landed. ""Aw sick, you have no idea what just floated past me,"" said Max. Morticia rolled her eye's as she started to climb down, ""where's the other bar's?!,"" she asked sheepishly. ""Just jump,"" Max replied looking up at her. ""It's not far, trust me."" ""Oh, right, trust you, Max Kimble, the kid who once told me to trust him in the 2nd grade by wearing a blindfold, then pushing me into a mud puddle, yeah right,"" she said sarcastically. ""I'm serious, come on."" ""Well... ok, but you've got to catch me,"" Morticia waited for a response. ""Uh, ok sure. I'll catch you."" She let go of the bars and jumped down, Max tried to catch her but she fell on him knocking them both over into the sewer water. Max kept his head above the surface, he didn't want to swallow any, sadly Morty wasn't so lucky, she shot up from the sewer water gasping for air. ""MAX!,"" she shouted angrily, ""YOU WERE SUPPOSED TO CATCH ME YOU IDIOT!"" Max helped her up. ""Sorry, I tried, but you came down at a funny angle...,"" he said trying to stifle a laugh. ""Oh sure,... erm... gross, now I smell like sewer water,"" she wiped her eye's with the back side of her right forearm. ""Where to now?,"" she asked. Max looked both way's down the nearly pitch black tunnel, lit only by dim light bulbs that hung from the ceiling of the sewer which seemed to be entangled with vines and brown roots of some kind, he shrugged his shoulders, ""don't ask me man, I just work here."" ""A man hole, we've got to find one,"" Morticia started down the right side of the sewer tunnel. ""How do you know that's the right way?,"" Max asked. She stopped and turned to him, ""Max, the town ain't that big if you haven't noticed. We're bound to run into one sooner or later, this place can't be that big."" Max stood still, looking in the opposite direction. Morticia stopped again, turning towards him once more, ""you coming or are you just gonna stand around with that 'I'm lost' look on your face all day?"" Max scoffed and unwillingly followed. Minutes later they found one, by now they were dreading the stench of the sewer, eager to get to the surface to the rain, the only thing they dreaded worse than the smell of the sewer was the flesh eating corpses which awaited them above. Max was the first up, since he was the one with the pistol, and probably had a better chance of being eaten first. Such a friend Morticia was. Max didn't let it get to him though, she was his best friend now, and if that meant getting nibbled on by ravenous corpses then so be it. He reached the top of the bar ladder, pushing the manhole cover up, it came open easier then expected but was heavy. He pushed it aside, the cold rain drop's hitting his face, he could see his own breath in the air as he surfaced. He climbed up all the way and turned back to help Morticia up, she surfaced and she too was relieved to feel the cold rain drop's on her face. The dual sat next to the man hole for a second, taking in the welcoming fresh air, a nice change from the stagnant stench of the sewer system. ""T-time to go!,"" Max said climbing to his feet, Morticia saw what he saw and scrambled to her feet as well. Max had been a few step's ahead of her but turned and waited for his friend before continuing to flee. Behind them a sea of the undead moved towards them, spread out thick taking up the full width of the street, moving ever forward like a cannibalistic tidal wave of the damned. ""Where are we going?,"" asked Max in between breath, Morticia had taken the lead once again as she was a faster runner than him. Morticia looked back, seeing the intimidating army of the undead shambling after them, only a few now fresh enough to run, ""the bridge, we've got to get out of this town!"" Max voiced no disagreement and continued to run, the dusty pike bridge was on the west side of the town, where he and Morticia where, if they could make it there then maybe they could loose the creatures. It wasn't long before they could see the bridge in sight, though the heavy fog which had set in rather quickly only permitted them to see so much... Private Beckman stood behind the sandbag and barbwire blockade formed on the bridge, on the opposite side of the blockade bullet riddled vehicles littered the base of it along with the bodies of the re-killed corpses. The town's other exit's had been blocked by similar methods, though most of the wooded area had to be patrolled by helicopter and ground unit's. All of the SS units that had entered the town hadn't returned or reported back. ""Private Beckman, has there been any contact with the SS?,"" Captain Luc asked. Beckman shook his head, ""no sir, this storm's been messin' with our radio equipment, haven't been able to raise anyone within the I.Z."" The captain mumbled something then went off to bother someone else. Beckman sighed, he couldn't wait till this stuff was over, he wanted to get home to his family. His wife had just had their first kid a few day's earlier, named him George after General George S. Patton, which was Beckman's idol. He let out a raspy cough which nearly name him drop his M4, he walked over to Private Bates who manned the m60, positioning it's tripod on the top of a sandbag as he knelt on one knee. Bates had seen a lot of thing's that day, thing's he hadn't been prepared for, though he'd been selected to protect the bridge all he could do was his duty, not to let any body out. If anyone were to approach the blockade they were to be put down immediately, be they man woman or child. He wasn't the only one with his gun trained in the direction of the town, towards the opposite side of the bridge. There were forty other men with him, but even that didn't make him feel safe. The first car that had sped towards the bridge had been riddled with a barrage of bullet's from nervous troops, those who survived only lived long enough to see their family members bleed to death, in one case a kid in the back seat had only been injured but the rest of his family had been killed. After a few minutes the other three in the car came back to life, and tore the kid apart as he sat wounded in the back seat. Yes sir, there was one to tell his grand kid's some day. ""Hey,"" said Beckman as he took a knee next to Bates. Bates nearly jumped out of his skin, he had been deep in thought, ""hey,"" he replied keeping his eye's dead ahead. ""Hell of a day, huh?,"" commented Beckman who was now pointing his M4 in the same direction as Bates. ""To say the least. I didn't join the corps for this kinda thing, I joined to see the world, hell, I wanted to be the first kid on my block to get a confirmed kill, I didn't join to be put out in the stick's to kill innocent civilian's,"" Bates grip tightened on the m60's pistol grip as he stared ahead. ""Yeah, well the only innocent are the unborn,"" replied Beckman. ""But yeah, I know what you're talkin' about. I didn't join up to put holes in my neighbor's either, orders are orders."" ""Everyone's real nervous, there's thing's happenin' here that shouldn't be happenin',"" Bates sighed. ""I don't know if I'll ever be able to sleep again man, not after I've seen this kinda shit... Dead people comin' back to life, mothers and fathers eatin' their children... It ain't right..."" Beckman let out another raspy cough, he paused for a long time before replying. ""You know, when they told me to aim for the head, 'cause other shot's wouldn't work, I told myself my hearin's goin'. Told myself I was hearin' them wrong, until I saw my first. It's wrong, I know, but order's are order's."" ""You hear that?,"" asked Bates. Beckman quieted down and listened, he could hear it. The sound of hundreds of the undead moaning in unison, their distinctive dreadful hunger filled moans. ""Lock and load ladies, we've got company!,"" Captain Luc shouted as he heard the same noise as the rest. Beckman's breathing became ragged and unsteady, he was getting nervous, his hand trembled as it rested on the M4's pistol grip, his index finger anxiously resting on the trigger gently. Bates swallowed his fear and righted the M60, mounted it to his shoulder sternly, relying on the tripod to take most of the weight. The soldiers were ready to gun down anything that came out of the thick gray fog, who ever and whatever it may be. ""Come on, we're almost there!,"" shouted Morticia to Max. Max ran as fast as he could, the sound of the creatures moaning behind him pushed him harder. ""Come on!,"" Morticia's foot clanked down on the steel surface of the bridge. Morticia was on the ground before she heard the shots, Max heard the shots before he felt the pain. Max could feel his warm blood rushing up his throat, forcing his lip's open as it shot into the air and fell across his face and pavement in a random scarlet pattern. He coughed up more of his own coppery flavored crimson body fluid and closed his eye's, he could feel them in his stomach and chest, a few of the bullets still burned inside. He had never thought about bullets burning though, never thought the pain would be like this. He flopped around on the ground like a fish on land, the pain clouding his mind like the fog that engulfed him, he whimpered and groaned in pain. He caught a glimpse of Morticia out of the corner of his eye, she wasn't moving; wasn't breathing. A pool of blood was steadily forming around her motionless body, but Max could only feel his own pain, his hand's curled into tight fist's, his black painted fingernails dug into his palm as the pain from his wounds made him press harder. Cold bodies crashed to the steel surfaced bridge near him, few seconds passed before he could feel the pain leaving him, all was going peaceful now. He could hear nothing, but he watched with a silent eye as the corpses that had once pursued him dropped like flies, most down for good but others with shattered ankles and knee's, only slowed by the slug's which the living threw by mean's of their guns. Max closed his eye's as everything seemed to be getting brighter, though it didn't hurt his eye's, he knew soon he would be seeing Morticia. His breathing slowed, his fist's uncurled, his body went limp, the warmth already fleeing, his last breath escaped freely carrying away his soul, he was leaving hell behind........ ""There's too many,"" the freight filled words crawled slowly out of Private Beckman's gaping maw. Private Bates still fired away, but for every one he put down another took it's place. It seemed pointless, even for a town the size of Grovers Mill there was still more than they had expected. Beckman slapped a fresh clip into his M4, lock and load, he continued to fire at random target's with no time to choose, some of the damned thing's were running. ""Keep shooting men!,"" Captain Luc shouted in a tone that was something like seriousness, but bordering on the verge of psychopathic. It wasn't long before the thing's reached the barbed wire and turned over wrecked cars, not much of a blockade but it would have to do. The enemy was only inches away, Bates and Beckman could smell them, it was no longer firing at distant shapes, it was looking at their faces. The faces of the damned, the faces of evil. The first to reach the barbed wire sheepishly walked into it, then fell forward becoming entangled in the sharp and treacherous fray, becoming easy targets. Beckman had been firing away randomly when he had heard the two single most beautiful words that had ever been spoken. ""FALL BACK!"" There was no need to tell him twice, he stood up and moved in the opposite direction along with the other troops, Bates at his side keeping a weary eye. The falling rain and fog shielded hazardous dangers that could pop out at any moment, and when they did they'd meet Bates welcoming M60. The troop's piled into various military transport vehicles, both air and land before leaving the area in a speedy pace. Minutes later the sound of fast moving aircraft shooting through the air excited some of the creatures below as they shambled about through the streets of Grovers Mill, still in search of food. Endlessly in search. Most lazily tilted their heads towards the gray sky as a pair of black objects fell from the heavens, a high pitched whistling noise accompanying them. The town disappeared in a flash of bright light, shock waves spread outwards from the impact points leaving a path of fiery destruction in their wake. As the smoke cleared and the fires fizzed out all that remained where Grovers Mill once sat was a flat lot littered with random lumps of ash and the charred shells of ravaged buildings General Worthington sat behind his steel desk, a few manila folders sitting before him idly. He puffed on a fat Cuban cigar as he sat back in his swivel chair, feet up on the desk. He took the time to reach over and grab one of the folders and opened it, looking at the paper clipped pages. ""No less than 24 hour's after the chemical was released into a controlled environment the entire town, population 650, succumbed to it's effect's, either infected by the carrier's or by the chemical itself through inhalation. Special operation units known as the 'SS' effort's to survive within the I.Z. were hopeless, suggestion is of course more training to combat and contain the U.D. within an I.Z. so that if said chemical were ever used in war time scenario's the U.D. may be swiftly dealt with after their purpose was fulfilled. Storms caused by the chemical in open air have been reported to mess with radio and radar equipment."" The general flipped the page in the thin report. ""Estimated time it would take for the chemical to infect the population such as a city - Example: Bullethill City - no less than 7 day's. Smaller area's would succumb in a shorter time frame."" The General picked up the other folders and opened his file cabinet, he slid them in a larger brown folder marked ""Operation Paperclip."" He opened one of his desk's drawers and pulled out a liter of Vodka and a shot class, he poured himself a shot with a sigh. He wished the chemical had never been developed, there were some weapon's mankind shouldn't possess. The End."‎Jeffrey Weise

Kind of a plain and boring name I think, I hate my first name so most of my friend's call me by me last, and I would prefer that it would be that way around here if that's not to much to ask. I'm a writer (horror only, though might experiment with non-horror stories some day), and I'm 15... That's about it, just wanted to make myself known to everybody.

2003-04-16‎"This is my first fan fic' (that I've started on this board), it's basicaly like this: the storys take place in a world where a literal global apocolyptic nightmare is taking place. Vurtually every evil and horrific creature ever imagined is praying upon the earth, Vampires, Werewolves,Zombies,Demons ect.All stereotypical weapons against these creatures must be used to dispose of these creatures like silver bullets for Werewolves, wooden stakes for Vampires,severe damage to the brain for Zombies. You may lead up to 10 charactors, 15 at the max. You cannot kill another person's charactor without that person's consent. You don't need any permission to kill off the creatures (Werewolves ect). You can'not control major figures such as Presidents,Prime ministers, or any major head of the country type government officials NO QUESTIONS ASKED (lol). Other rules: No infinite ammunition. No god powers, invincibility ect. And try to make all of your post's at least 2 paragraphs long. Also,you can have ""custom"" weapons since that's basicaly what a silver bullet is. You can (if literaly possible) a three barreled shotgun, a wooden stake gun (as seen on so much vampire movies) and all that other stuff that qualifies as custom. I think that about raps it up,enjoy."‎Jeffrey Weise

2003-04-18‎"Jack Slitheryn Here's my official 1st RP post,tell me what you think. (I RP slightly different than most because I kinda' RP my characters in a third person story format). The young rookie drew his Berretta m29 and cocked the hammer back. ""F-freeze!,""he shouted at the man sucking on the young womans neck. As soon as the sound of his voice reached his ear's he dropped the young woman who had two puncture wounds on her neck,each an inch apart. The rookie's partner called it in and stepped out of the police cruiser and also drew his weapon. The woman on the ground appeared to be dead and was just seen in this man's hand's, the man who had drank the womans blood was now a murderer in the polices eye's. ""Freeze asshole or I'll blow yer fucken' brains out!,""the other cop said,a slightly over weight caucasian police officer with a thick mustache and double chin. The man with a stream of blood escaping from the left side of his purple lip's continued to walk toward's them, he seemed to float along the ground as if gliding. His feet never moved as he glided on the ground towards the police cruiser. The rookie fired a single warning shot into the air ""don't come one step closer!."" The man came into view more as he entered the reaches of the squad car's headlights. The two police officer's nearly dropped their weapon's at the site of him.He was completely bald,his ear's seemed of those of an elf and his nose reminded them of Count Chocula,his teeth were twisted and yellow.They looked like they had went untreated for hundreds of years,jagged and pointed every wich way,the top and bottom portions met each other looking like the bottoms of two broken beer bottles pushed together with two long fangs spaced two teeth apart in the middle. ""**** it,drop this creepy son-of-a-*****!,""the fat cop shouted to the other. BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! BLAM!BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! BLAM!BLAM! BLAM! BLAM!BLAM! BLAM! BLAM!BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! Each cop unloaded their clip into the mans body. The rookie continued to pull the trigger,dry fireing. The over weight cop quickly reloaded and pulled the slide back on his pistol putting a bullet in the chamber. Both men stood frozen in fear, the creepy ******* in the cape was still standing.He examined the bloodless bullet holes in his body breifly with his head tilted down.He slowly raised his head revealing a twisted expression of pleasure.A ghastly shriek penetrated the cops' ear's as they looked on in utter disbelief as the ******* in the cape burst into flames, being reduced to nothing but an exact replica only made out of grey ash, blow away in the light cool breeze of night. A man in a black trench coat stood three feet behind where the creepy blood sucking once stood, wearing a crusifix around his neck,he held a bow gun.He walked over to what was left of the ash and retrieved his wooden stake. The two police officers,still in shock, turned to each other and than to the mysterious man who had just saved their asses and said at the same time: ""what the **** was that thing!?"" The man threw back the side of his trench coat and swiftly set the stake back into a pouch. ""That,gentlemen, was a vampire. And before you give me that 'they don't exsist' bullshit lem'me assure you, they're as real as the ground you stand on, ""the man turned and walked away. The man in the trench coat turned to them one last time and said ""names Jack Slytherin by the way,and I assume you'll both be seeing alot more of me."" He stopped half way and pulled out a small vile.""Holy water, ""he said to himself opening the cap and pouring it on the vampires last victim,she too burst into flames and blew away.He set the vile back into his pocket and continued to walk off into the darkness."‎Jeffrey Weise
2003-04-19‎"Jack and an Old freind The SWAT team busted through the apartment complexs' front door wich had been barracaded. The interior was a site of ghoulish slaughter,blood had been splattered on the milky white walls, the marble flooring had been slathered in ankle deep gore.A SWAT team members bends over and lifts up his face mask,he chucks all over the floor. ""Jusus fucking christ...I've never seen anything like this before, ""another SWAT team member say's lowering his MP5. A creature dropped from the ceiling of the dimly lit entrance way taking the SWAT team commander to the ground. Several other things joined their companion in attacking the SWAT team,bullet's flew as the SWAT team opened fire riddling the ravenous civilians with bullet's. Fresh blood splashed the wall wich had already been coated with the crimson body fluid.Minutes later the last gun shot was heard,a Bennelli shotgun round.A police blockade had been formed around the apartment complex,snipers had taken strategic posistions around the building.A helicopter flew overhead positioning it's spot light on the last surviving SWAT team member who emerged from the shadowy entrance. He took three step's and collapsed holding his throat wich was bleeding profusely. Jack stood atop the grocery store across the street of the apartment building. The sniper's paid no attention to him, assuming he was some kind of new officer.Another man walked up to him, wearing a black leather trenchcoat and a .30-6 hunting rifle slung over his shoulder. ""Jack Slitheryn, ""the man said. Jack turned around. ""Hunter Prince, ""Jack said with a smile. Jack and Hunter hugged. ""Jesus christ,haven't seen you since O'Biernin '86, ""Hunter readied his .30-6. ""Yeah,that whole town was loaded with Vamps' and Werewolves, ""Jack pulled out his Bow gun. ""I caught wind of this through the CB radio in my car,I think we've got Bats and wolves in there,""Hunter said.Jack nodded. Jack was the best archer in the world,and Hunter could pick off a moving humming bird from up to three miles away with a clear line of site.Hunters gun was loaded with .30-6 silver bullets, Jack's bow gun had special tip's on his arrow's made of a strong wood to peirce the rib cage and strike the heart.Jack knelt down and took aim,Hunter laid on his belly and turned on his nightvision for his scope,he took aim at the door..."‎Jeffrey Weise

He grabbed Jack by the colar and pulled him close. ""Get that *******!""Prince said wincing in pain. The sharpshooters turned their attention to the figure in the flowing cloak high on the sky scraper. ""I've hit him more than three times already!,""one of the snipers said reloading his sniper rifle. body of a young female hitting the grocery stores roof. Jack noticed the stake and the note. The letters were words were printed in blood,it took Jack a second to pick of the scent of Demons blood. The note had been written in German and in demon blood. The note read: ""Eraten wer Ist Rücken in der Spiele."" Jack thought to himself ""Karlat."" A hummer with a truck like back and an M60 emplacement took aim at Karlat who sat atop the sky scraper.It was the national guard, the M60 spit simulainious rounds tearing into the concrate around Karlat.Jack slid down a pipe on the side of the building as the vampire crawled back into a window.He ran into the sky scrapers entrance sticking an thin long wooden stake on the bow gun and jumped into the elevator. He heard distant screams of pain and three gun shots before silence. ""Vampires rarely use human weapons, ""Jack thought as the elevators bell dinged. Within he was at the floor wich the vampire had entered in. The power went out just as Jack stepped out of the elevator but Jack could see just as well,helicopters circled as well as the stationary spot lights on the ground witch shined in through the windows. Jack was careful where he stepped. There were lasers coming in through all the windows, the snipers had this place staked out as well. A swift movement ahead made Jack more alert.He walked by an open door, he hit the ground as Karlat kicked him in the side.Jack took aim quickly squeezing the Bow guns trigger sending a wooden stake into Karlats chest missing his heart by two inches.Karlat quickly kicked Jack in the jaw and threw him against a wall with fluid grace.Jack groaned drawing his 12"" special forces knive and slicing off one of Karlats finger, he knew it was useless since the finger would within hours but it bought him some time to load another stake. regenerate Karlat knocked the stake away before it could peirce his heart and hissed.He slowly walked over to his advisary who was breathing hard on the floor slipping in and out of conciousness. The door to the staircase burst open as another division of the SWAT team burst in with their guns blazing,Karlat reacted quickly ascending into the rafters. The SWAT team looked around confused and nervously panning the flashlights attatched to their guns around the corridor.A square of the ceiling tiles broke away as Karlat pulled a SWAT team member up into the rafters. The SWAT team fired randomly into the air.Jack crawled into an open apartment were he could recover for a few moments...."‎Jeffrey Weise
2003-06-19‎"Grey turned his back on Cibil check around the corner of the shadowy hallway.That's when he heard it, the tell tail sound of a Baretta m9s hammer being cocked back,he felt it's cold barrel against the back of his head. ""Cibil...?, ""Grey asked,still a little unsure of who was behind the pistol. ""Yeah, that's right,now drop your weapon's,"" she replied with a grin on her face. ""What are you doing...?,""Grey complied with her order's,dropping his pistol's and shotgun. ""Why are you doing this?, ""Grey asked hearing her breathing get slower. ""All these fucking question's ya' stupid Mick...remember when we first met,you told me your name was Grey O'brien,and back there,you told me how you were a hitman. I've been peiceing this together ever since you told me that last bit. My father,a Lawyer, Thomas Lawry,remember him? He was killed by an Irish mobster, by the name of Grey O'brien AKA The Ghost.After his death I looked into your little Gang, did a little searching myself and found out you were the guy who killed my father."" ""I've never even hea-"" ""Silence!, ""Cibil shouted, pressing the barrel of the gun harder against the back of his skull"" You were the one who did it,three shot's,one to his stomache,another to his chest,and another to his skull."" ""I SWEAR!, ""Grey shouted,now knowing this crazy broad behind the gun was serious. ""Do you realy have the gut's to shoot a man in the face, look a man in the eye when you kill him?!.""Grey shouted turning to Cibil,his voice echoed through the corridors, he found the barrel of the Baretta m9 in between his eye's. ""You know what? I think I do.Adios mother fucker!, ""Cibil quickly lowered the pistol squeezing the trigger once. A bullet ripped through Grey's stomache, he fell to his knee's gasping for air,he was notorious in the ""business"" for being bullet proof,never once getting a scratch in anyone of his job's,they never could hit him, he was like a Ghost wich earned him his alias. He looked down at the gun shot wound,blood poured out of it,the peice of led still burned with fury inside him,schrieking like an injured cat. It hurt like a *****.Grey felt blood pooling up in his mouth, it ran out the sides of his lip's streaking down his neck and staining his white muscle shirt. Grey looked up at Cibil one last time, she was smileing. He heard the pistol bark again, this time, it ruptured his chest cavity,screaming through his rip cage and peircing his heart. His eye's rolled to the back of his head,everything was dark. All he could hear was faint distorted sound's, he heard Cibil's Baretta bark one last time before his body died. It has splattered his brain's all over the school's marble floor.But this didn't matter to Grey, for hell awaited him in darkness of eternity..."‎Jeffrey Weise
2003-06-14‎OCC: Actualy, in the original NOTLD one of the THEORIES as to why the dead were returning was radiation from a crashed sattelite, but it was never stated as fact.George A.Romero never explains why the dead are re-animating, I guess that's one of the reason's I like the dead trilogy so much.‎Jeffrey Weise
2003-06-08‎"To Answer your question Scrinlord: In Goerge A.Romero's version (he's the one that started the entire flesh eating zombie thing, the makers of Resident Evil just used his ""style"" zombies), but anyway's,in Goerge A.Romero's version of Zombie movies there isn't an explanation as to why the dead are returning to life, they just are, there are thoeries to as why but nothing solid. They are slowly (as all dead bodies would be after rigor mortis sets in), they are weak and very easy to dispose of if they are alone (a single shot to the head, or sever trauma to the cranium or chopping its head off ect.), but they are dangerous in large numbers. If you've got any question's just ask ME(I'm sort of an expert on this whole flesh eating Zombie topic)."‎Jeffrey Weise

""We're about thirty miles away from Chicago, I know that much, but I'm not sure exactly where we are, we might be in Minnesota, ""Draven replied looking at his road map. Annie brushed her dark red hair away from her face and began checking her Baretta.Draven looked over at his beautiful wife Annie,they had met a few minutes after he had shot a lawyer on the street's of Chicago from a rooftop with a PSG-1 supressed sniper rifle a year before. He was in a rush to get away from the area,since the lawyer was under police protection and they'd surely have about forty pigs searching the area. Draven had to get rid of the rifle,so he wiped his prints off the trigger and grip and tossed it off the roof top,amazingly,it impaled a police officer as he checked the lawyer for a pulse. Draven met Annie as she was in the same building, strangling one of the employee's to death with a peice of Piano wire on the staircase,Draven fell in love with her at first site. Two contract killer's meeting on the same day with their target's dead a few minutes apart. They both made a smooth escape through the back exit. Draven had never heard of Annie,but she worked for the same guy as he did. Mr.Runey,an Irish mobster. As soon as the shit hit the fan Runey was killed in an assination by a black gangster name Tay.But that was in the past, Draven was now looking for his freind Grey, Ironicaly he was another contract killer. A creature lumbered forward,creeping up on Draven and Annie's parked car.It picked up a rock and slowly made it's way over to the back window, it started to hit the glass window, but the window didn't brake because of the lack of energy the creature had. ""Shit, let's get that peice of shit before he brakes our window,""Annie said climbing out of the car.Draven followed. ""Hey you, yeah you rotten mother fucker!,""Annie shouted taunting the creature, beckoning it to come closer. As she did Draven snuck up behind it, Annie grinned as Draven grabbed ahold of it's shirt and jerked it back knocking it off balance,Draven cocked the hammer back on his .45 and stuck the barrel in it's mouth squeezing the trigger,blood shot up and hit him on the face. Annie started to laugh. ""God damn it!,""Draven said whiping the blood off his face. Draven looked at her and smiled as they climbed back into the car..."‎Jeffrey Weise
2003-06-03‎"Grey and Cibil took refuge in a little shanty on the side of the road.Grey leaned his shotgun against the shacks wall. Cibil sat on the floor in the darkest corner of the room. They were in a rural area,not another house for miles. They knew it would be awhile before one of the creatures made it's way out this far. Grey lit a few candles for light. Grey took a seat at a warped wooden table,he unholstered his .44 Magnum and began checking it.Cibil gazed at him.Grey set the magnum down on the table infront of him and turned to Cibil. ""What did you used to do before this?...I've seen how you killed those ghoul's, with out a second thought, ""Cibil asked. ""...I've done my share of killing, ""Grey said ""I used to work for Murphia."" ""Murphia? whats that?, ""Cibil shifted her position. ""The Irish mob..., ""Grey replied.

""It don't bother me,I guess I'm sort of proud of it, ""Grey holstered his magnum. The tell tale moan of one of the creatures. ""Shit...any we barely got enough rest, ""Grey stood up and walked calmly over to his shotgun. It was already loaded. He ran over to the door, it shook again. He leveled the shotgun up to shoulders length and squeezed the trigger,a basketball sized hole tore in the wooden door. He heard a loud thud, he looked out the hole down to the headless figure below. He grinned. Grey turned to Cibil ""I just blew our hiding spot, we've better go..."""‎Jeffrey Weise

Everything was still silent, but sound was slowly fading in.He heard a someone out of breath,grunting everytime a loud metalic thud sounded.Grey opened his eye's. ""JESUS FUCKING CHRIST!!!,""Grey shouted looking at Cibil. Cibil was 19,she had red hair and was good looking, Grey and another survivor he had met named Aitch had found her in a university dorm room nearly being eaten by her room mate turned zombie. Since the first second Grey had seen Aitch he knew there was something off beat about him. Cibil's shirt had been torn off and her bra had also been removed. She was crying but had an evil look on her face,she had a lead pipe in her left hand and sat on top of Aitch. She brang the pipe down hard upon Aitches head again splattering Grey with a few more speckles of blood.Aitches pants were down to his ankles, Grey already knew what had happened, Cibil continued to viciously bash Aitches skull in.A pool of Aitches thick crimson blood was already forming. Grey wiped the blood speckles off his face. ""FUCKING HELL! WHAT THE **** ARE YOU DOING?!!!, ""Grey shouted again. ""He raped me!He fucking RAPED ME!!!, ""Cibil barked back and hit Aitch on the head again. The living dead outside had locked onto Grey and Cibils location, they banged on the front door of the small one bedroom house. ""Jesus.... ""Grey said now that he had grasped the situation. Cibil started to cry,she struggled to bring the pipe down on Aitches head again but something was stopping her.After a few more failed attempts she gave up. Grey took the blood and gore encrusted pipe and threw it aside.He knelt down beside Cibil and wrapped his brown quilt around her. ""He's dead....he's dead, ""Grey said trying to calm Cibil down. ""The ******* ""she said with tear's rolling down her cheek's. Grey stood Cibil up and took her a few step's back, he grabbed his over and under shotgun wich was leaning against the houses sheet rock wall next to them. ""The fucking *******... ""Cibil said again crying on Greys shoulder. ""shhh, ""Grey said ""it's ok now he's dead."" He put his arm around her trying to comfort her. ""We've got to go now, ""Grey turned to the door ""it won't be long before those dead ****s get inside."" Grey un-holstered his Baretta m9 out of his hip holster and handed it over to Cibil ""here, there's fifteen shot's in there,aim for the head,like always."" Cibil nodded. Grey knelt down to Aitches dead body.He quickly un-hooked the ammo pouch from Aitches belt and hooked it onto his belt next to his pouch full of.12 gauge shells and grabbed Aitches .44 Magnum and holster. The pouch was filled with 44 cartridges.Grey could hear the insidious moans of the living dead outside,they craved their meal wich dwelled within the house. ""Shit!,""Grey said as the door gave in,it swung open and hit the wall shaking the entire house. The ghouls rushed in through the freshly breached front door, Grey took aim with his 12 gauge and pulled the trigger tearing the zombie on the business end in half.Cibil raised the Baretta to shoulders length and squeezed the trigger once nailing a chearleader ghoul in the forehead,greenish sludge shot out of the fresh bullet hole as the cheerleader corpse crashed to it's knee's and slumped over backwards. ""The backdoor,GO!, ""Grey shouted motioning Cibil away. She ran for it.Grey popped open his .12 gauges barrels ejecting the two spent shell casings,he reached into his pouch and slid in two more fresh round's as he slowly moved backwards to the backdoor.More of the living dead were flooding in through the front door,but Grey had a bullet for each of them..."‎Jeffrey Weise

Gecko had already radioed the sniper somewhere nearby to assure he wouldn't be pecked off. He put on his show. He walked up to one of the african street gangsters standing near the back entrance smoking a cigarette.He quickly patted his pockets. ""Aye homeboy you got a light?,""Gecko said in a mocking tone. ""What did you say motha' fucka?!,""the gangster said reaching into his pants to pull out a pistol. Gecko quickly unsheathed his KA-BAR survival knife and threw it like a tomahawk digging into the gangsters skull before he could squeeze off a round. Gecko ran up to the door and jerked the blade from the dead gangsters head,he quickly sheathed the knife and retrieved the dead gangsters weapon,a .38 special. He could get past this outter door easily,he did,afterall,grow up in Little Havana.And in Little Havana you had to know how to get past any lock if you wanted those few extra bucks for ""munchies."""‎Jeffrey Weise

2003-05-18‎"Gecko sat at the bar of the Malibu club. ""Are you sure you dont want something to drink?, ""the hot bartender in a bakini and cowboy hat asked. ""Nah, I've got to talk to someone and I don't wanna' be stumbling aroun' when I'm gunna' talk business, ""Gecko replied. ""Ok,""the bartender said slipping him a small peice of folded paper ""names Alchemy,gimme a call sometime."" Gecko grinned and slid the peice of paper in the inside breast pocket of his black overcoat. He pulled out a pack of cigarretes and pulled one out, he put it in his mouth,it hung limp, he tucked away the pack of cigarettes in his inner breast pocket and pulled out his zippo lighter, he dropped it.He bent down to pick it up just than Tommy Vercetti walked past him and up to his office,Gecko sat back up not even noticing that Vercetti had arrived. He lit up his cigarrette and took a drag. He saw the light of the office up stairs flip on. Gecko walked up to the two body gaurds standing infront of the stair case leading up to the office. ""I'm here to see Mr. Vercetti,Micheal sent me,""Gecko said. ""Micheal Sullivan?, ""one of them asked. ""Yeah, I'm here about some work, ""Gecko replied. ""I'll go see if he's not busy, ""the guard on the left one said walking up the stair's."‎Jeffrey Weise
2003-05-18‎"Gecko sat in the diner sipping a cup of Coffee.A freind of his Micheal sat down across from him. Gecko looked up, he already had his Desert Eagle .357 pointed at Micheal under the table. ""What do you want?,""Gecko said. ""Take it easy Geck',I've just come to talk, ""Micheal replied resting both hands on the table to show he wasn't armed. ""So...talk, ""Gecko said taking another sip of his coffee. ""I heard about the shit you pulled at the strip bar,everyone's been talken' about it. They're callen' you 'The Bullet proof Lizard"",""Micheal said with a grin. Gecko laughed ""The Bullet proof Lizard? Why are they callen' me 'dat?"" ""Because,everyone knew you walked away without a scratch, ""Micheal leaned in ""I know a guy who I can get you some work with."" ""Work? I just got done whacking a fucken' underboss of the Ferelli family and his goons, I already know I've got a price on my head, why would a dead man like me be looken' for work?,""Gecko quietly slid the Desert Eagle .357 back into it's holster. ""Because,I know a guy who has a vendetta against the Ferelli family, his names Tommy Vercetti,he's looken' for more stone cold killer's, he's got some of the best in the league like those crazy bastards Sharp and Dice."" ""Yeah I've heard of those two,and Vercetti...you trust him?,""Gecko asked. ""You know me I don't trust anyone, but I think I might be able to set a little 'business' meeting up, ""Micheal replied. ""Ok,do it,""Gecko finished his cup of coffee. ""Meet me at the Malibu dance club tommorow evening, if Tommys there he's there, if he's not there than forget about it,Capesche?"" Gecko nodded. ""Aight,take it easy. I'm out, ""Micheal stood up and walked out. ""Fucking *****, ""Gecko said under his breath."‎Jeffrey Weise
2003-05-17‎"""I told you,I didn't do anythin', I was just in the wrong place at the wrong time,""Gecko said calmly. The hot light over his head wasn't making him talk, he had been in this chair plenty of times before. ""Yeah you've told me this before, we've got witnesses. We've got the two .45s tha-"" ""The two .45s that havent been fired,""Gecko said cutting the fat fed off ""and about these witnesses you claim to have, what are 'dey,'da fucken ground and walls?!"" ""LISTEN TOUGH GUY!, WE'VE GOT ENOUGH EVIDENCE TO PUT YOU BEHIND BARS FOR THE REST OF YOUR FUCKEN' LIFE, YOU CAN BE SOMEONE'S ***** FOR ALL I CARE!, ""the sweating FBI agent shouted. ""Get 'da **** outta' here,if you had the evidence and witnesses you'd have me in the fucken' cage right now!, ""Gecko shouted. The fat FBI agent went over to another ""He aint gunna' talk, we've got nuthin."" The other agent nodded ""Cut 'em loose."" The jailor behind him uncuffed Gecko. Two Hours Later, The Strip Club A knock came on the back door. One of the big Mafia goons slid the metal plating over the rectangular looking hole to the side and peeked out. ""Who 'da **** is it?!,""he asked.No reply came. He turned to the other goon ""prolly some fucken' kids."" The goon infront of the door grinned and turned back to look out again, he found himself looking into the triangular barrel of a massive hand cannon,a Desert Eagle .357. ""Oh shit..., ""he said. BADAMM! The mafia goons face emploded. The other goon quickly ran over to the door with his SPAS-12 shotgun and opened the door. He stepped out side quickly looking around. He saw nothing,the alley was bare,except for the dumpster.He could see nothing,Gecko dropped from the fire escape above the door with his knife drawn, he burried the knife in the goons back severing his spinal cord the goon died instantly. Gecko pulled the knife out of the mafia door gaurd. Another big ******* came running down the hallway towards Gecko,the hallway was briefly lit by the strobe lights of the main lobby, where the strippers and dancers were.Gecko raised the Desert Eagle and fired three shots into the gaurd dropping him to the ground stone cold dead. Paulie sat in his office sweating,a nervous wreck.His hands trembled, he had a bottle of tequllia in one hand and a burning cigarrette in the other. He heard the gun shots and scream's from outside,he knew who it was. Gecko was coming for him.A few seconds later all the gunshots stopped.Paulie stood up holding his sawn off Ithica over and under shotgun. The door flung open,someone came sliding in on a rolling chair,Paulie squeezed the trigger hitting the person on the chair in the chest making it cave in. The person was wearing Geckos' top hat and over coat, the top hat fell off,it was Regina.Paulie's favorite dancer. Paulies attention turned to the metalic clanking of a small tank of propane rolling into the room,it stopped at Paulies' feet. ""Why?,""Gecko asked stepping into the light of the office from the darkness of the hallway. ""...I'm so fucken' sorry Gecko please don't do this to me!, ""Paulie said breaking down into tear's. Gecko shook his head in disgust. ""I'm so sorry!!!, ""Paulie cried out again, he put his hand's together as if praying ""PLEASE HAVE MERCY!!!SONNY FERRELI MADE ME DO IT!"" Gecko took his top hat off of Reginas dead body and put it on himself. He turned to the door. ""So long Paulie, ""he said flipping Paulie off over his shoulder. Paulie quickly went for his shotgun ""**** YOU YOU FREE HOLE!!!"" Gecko turned with his Desert Eagle aimed,he squeezed the trigger before Paulie could hitting the small propane tank,it erupted like a small atomic bomb destroying everything in a twelve foot radious.Paulie exploded,peices of him flew in every direction.Gecko walked away calmly. He no longer belonged to a Family,but he was a stone cold killer. The best. He could find work."‎Jeffrey Weise
2003-05-14‎"Gecko opened the envelope and pulled out the letter wich was printed on expensive parchement.It read: ""Gecko, Sonny's the rat whose been ratting the family out to the FEDs, do what you do best and get rid of his body. After you've done that forget you ever saw him Capesche?!"" -Paulie"" Gecko folded the note and put it in the inside breast pocket on his overcoat and continued to walk to his Cutlass. They both got in. ""So Sonny, what kinda' shit you do?, ""Gecko asked putting one hand on the steering wheel, he reached down to the left side of his seat and grabbed his unregistered snub- nose .38. Sonny laughed and paused for a few seconds ""...I'm a mechanic..."" Gecko chuckled ""A mechanic?A little behind on our fucken' terminology,eh?"" ""You know what a mechanic is?, ""Sonny said sarcasticaly. ""Fucken-a I know what a fucken' mechanic is,my fatha' used to use 'dat kinda slang when me 'n my bro's and sis's were little fucken' brats, ""Gecko snickered. Sonny laughed.""Where we goin'?"" he asked. Gecko pulled into an alley ""we've got business."" Gecko got out of the car and walked over to a door,Sonny followed closely behind. ""So...what we doin' he-"" BAM! Gecko had spun around so quick that Sonny had no time to react,the .38 had fired once striking Sonny in the left eye. Sonny fell to the ground dead. Gecko leaned forward a little bit to see if Sonny was still alive,he squeezed the trigger five more times striking Sonny in the face.Gecko whiped off the handle of his unregistered untraceable snub-nose .38 and dropped it on Sonnys dead body. Gecko reached into his left coat pocket and pulled out a clean milk white cloth and whiped the beed's of Sonnys thilthy blood off of his face and stuck it back into his coat. He spat on Sonnys corpse.Gecko dragged Sonny over to the car and stuck him into the drivers side seat and slammed the door,he tossed the gun note, and envelope into the car and walked over to the gas tank.He pulled the cloth out and stuffed it into the hole and pulled out his zippo lighter, he started it up and started to run. The car exploded. ""Fucken' rat basta'd, ""Gecko said laughing. A cop car pulled infront of him blocking the exit.Gecko quickly turned around and started for the other direction,another cop car pulled infront of that side. The SWAT team stood on the roof tops on both buildings above him pointing their weapons down at him.A police helicopter flew over.A FBI agent stood next to the SWAT team on the right building talking down to him on a bullhorn. ""This is the police, we've got you surrounded. Surrender any weapons you may be carrying and step away from them. Then put your hand's behind your head."" ""****!, ""Gecko shouted. ""It's a fucken' set up! Feds aren't just standing by on coincidence...Paulie...it was him,it had to be.He's goin' down!,""Gecko thought...

Toni Fulci ran to his car with a news paper over his head trying desperately to keep his greasy hair-do dry.He jumped into his Cutlas and started the engine.He lit up a cigarette and took a few drags before realising he didnt want it,he rolled down his window to throw it out since he was too fat and lazy to butt it out in the ash tray.A figure moved out of the shadows in a black top hat and knee length over coat,in both of his hands he held nickle plated Colt .45.He calmly walked up to Toni's car, Toni sat in it trying franticaly to roll up the window but the lever was stuck.Toni was totaly oblivious to the fact that a hitman was moving towards his car. ""BLAM!"" The shadowy figures gun spit out a single round strikeing Toni in the neck.Toni quickly turned to the shadowy figure. ""G-Gecko...?, ""Toni said coughing up blood. Gecko nodded and squeezed the trigger again popping off another round, blood splattered the interior of the car. Toni slumped over the passenger side seat with another .45 slug in his skull right below the left ear. Gecko threw back both sides of his overcoat and slid his Colt .45s into their hip holsters.He walked away calmly with an evil grin on his face. His street name was Gecko but only his family knew his real name, and they were all 6 feet under. He was a low-life mafia punk doing hit's for a man named Pauly Tucci.He grew up in Vice City in Little Cuba,even though his family was Italian his family couldn't afford a house anywhere else or an apartment. The man he had just whacked was Toni Fulci,another wise guy who got out of line,he had pissed off the wrong people and now he was dead. An Hour Later Gecko walked up to the back of the strip joint ran by Fat Andy and Joey Carbone.He kicked the door a few times to let guys behind the door know who it was. The thick steel door opened and Gecko stepped in. ""Hey Gecko How ya' doin'?,""one of the big henchmen in cheap suits asked. Gecko nodded and kept walking.He walked into one of the back offices and took a seat. ""So...is it done?, ""Pauly asked. Gecko nodded ""Yeah.I made sure."" Pauly smiled ""god damn Gecko I knew I could count on you."" Pauly threw him a half an inch thick brick of one hundred dollar bills.Gecko smiled and pocketed the cash.

""I've hit him more than three times already!, ""one of the snipers said reloading his sniper rifle. body of a young female hitting the grocery stores roof.Jack noticed the stake and the note. The letters were words were printed in blood,it took Jack a second to pick of the scent of Demons blood. The note had been written in German and in demon blood. The note read: ""Eraten wer Ist Rücken in der Spiele."" Jack thought to himself ""Karlat."" A hummer with a truck like back and an M60 emplacement took aim at Karlat who sat atop the sky scraper.It was the national guard,the M60 spit simulainious rounds tearing into the concrate around Karlat Jack slid down a pipe on the side of the building as the vampire crawled back into a window. He ran into the sky scrapers entrance sticking an thin long wooden stake on the bow gun and jumped into the elevator.He heard distant screams of pain and three gun shots before silence. ""Vampires rarely use human weapons,"" Jack thought as the elevators bell dinged. Within seconds he was at the floor wich the vampire had entered in. The power went out just as Jack stepped out of the elevator but Jack could see just as well, helicopters circled as well as the stationary spot lights on the ground witch shined in through the windows. Jack was careful where he stepped. There were lasers coming in through all the windows, the snipers had this place staked out as well.A swift movement ahead made Jack more alert.He walked by an open door, he hit the ground as Karlat kicked him in the side.Jack took aim quickly squeezing the Bow guns trigger sending a wooden stake into Karlats chest missing his heart by two inches.Karlat quickly kicked Jack in the jaw and threw him against a wall with fluid grace.Jack groaned drawing his 12"" special forces knive and slicing off one of Karlats finger, he knew it was useless since the finger would regenerate within hours but it bought him some time to load another stake. Karlat knocked the stake away before it could peirce his heart and hissed.He slowly walked over to his advisary who was breathing hard on the floor slipping in and out of conciousness. The door to the staircase burst open as another division of the SWAT team burst in with their guns blazing,Karlat reacted quickly ascending into the rafters. The SWAT team looked around confused and nervously panning the flashlights attatched to their guns around the corridor.A square of the ceiling tiles broke away as Karlat pulled a SWAT team member up into the rafters.

He took three step's and collapsed holding his throat wich was bleeding profusely. Jack stood atop the grocery store across the street of the apartment building.

The young rookie drew his Berretta m29 and cocked the hammer back. ""F-freeze!, ""he shouted at the man sucking on the young womans neck. As soon as the sound of his voice reached his ear's he dropped the young woman who had two puncture wounds on her neck,each an inch apart. The rookie's partner called it in and stepped out of the police cruiser and also drew his weapon. The woman on the ground appeared to be dead and was just seen in this man's hand's,the man who had drank the womans blood was now a murderer in the polices eye's. ""Freeze asshole or I'll blow yer fucken' brains out!,""the other cop said,a slightly over weight caucasian police officer with a thick mustache and double chin. The man with a stream of blood escaping from the left side of his purple lip's continued to walk toward's them, he seemed to float along the ground as if gliding. His feet never moved as he glided on the ground towards the police cruiser. The rookie fired a single warning shot into the air ""don't come one step closer!."" The man came into view more as he entered the reaches of the squad car's headlights. The two police officer's nearly dropped their weapon's at the site of him. He was completely bald,his ear's seemed of those of an elf and his nose reminded them of Count Chocula,his teeth were twisted and yellow. They looked like they had went untreated for hundreds of years, jagged and pointed every wich way,the top and bottom portions met each other looking like the bottoms of two broken beer bottles pushed together with two long fangs spaced two teeth apart in the middle. ***** it,drop this creepy son-of-a-*****!, ""the fat cop shouted to the other. BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! BLAM!BLAM! BLAM! BLAM!BLAM! BLAM! BLAM!BLAM! BLAM! BLAM!BLAM! BLAM! BLAM!BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! Each cop unloaded their clip into the mans body. The rookie continued to pull the trigger,dry fireing. The over weight cop quickly reloaded and pulled the slide back on his pistol putting a bullet in the chamber. Both men stood frozen in fear,the creepy ******* in the cape was still standing.He examined the bloodless bullet holes in his body breifly with his head tilted down. He slowly raised his head revealing a twisted expression of pleasure. A ghastly shriek penetrated the cops' ear's as they looked on in utter disbelief as the ******* in the cape burst into flames, being reduced to nothing but an exact replica only made out of grey ash, blow away in the light cool breeze of night. A man in a black trench coat stood three feet behind where the creepy blood sucking ******* once stood, wearing a crusifix around his neck, he held a bow gun.He walked over to what was left of the ash and retrieved his wooden stake The two police officers,still in shock,turned to each other and than to the mysterious man who had just saved their asses and said at the same time: ""what the **** was that thing!?"" The man threw back the side of his trench coat and swiftly set the stake back into a pouch. ""That,gentlemen, was a vampire. And before you give me that 'they don't exsist' bullshit lem'me assure you,they're as real as the ground you stand on,""the man turned and walked away. The man in the trench coat turned to them one last time and said ""names Jack Slytherin by the way,and I assume you'll both be seeing alot more of me."" He stopped half way and pulled out a small vile.""Holy water, ""he said to himself opening the cap and pouring it on the vampires last victim, she too burst into flames and blew away.He set the vile back into his pocket and continued to walk off into the darkness."‎Jeffrey Weise

2003-04-17‎"This is my first fan fic' (that I've started on this board), it's basicaly like this: the storys take place in a world where a literal global apocolyptic nightmare is taking place. Vurtually every evil and horrific creature ever imagined is praying upon the earth, Vampires, Werewolves,Zombies Demons ect.All stereotypical weapons against these creatures must be used to dispose of these creatures like silver bullets for Werewolves,wooden stakes for Vampires,severe damage to the brain for Zombies. You may lead up to 10 charactors, 15 at the max. You cannot kill another person's charactor without that person's consent. You don't need any permission to kill off the creatures (Werewolves ect). You can'not control major figures such as Presidents, Prime ministers, or any major head of the country type government officials NO QUESTIONS ASKED (lol). Other rules: No infinite ammunition. No god powers,invincibility ect. And try to make all of your post's at least 2 paragraphs long. Also, you can have ""custom"" weapons since that's basicaly what a silver bullet is. You can (if literaly possible) a three barreled shotgun,a wooden stake gun (as seen on so much vampire movies) and all that other stuff that qualifies as custom. I think that about raps it up,enjoy."‎Jeffrey Weise
2003-04-16‎"Jack grabbed a creature by the torn brown t-shirt and threw it to the ground.He grabbed the sawn-off SPAS12 wich hung at his side. The creatures' purple split lip's curled back revealing it's yellow rotting teeth.Jack jammed the shotgun into it's gaping maw and squeezed the hair trigger, the creatures head erupted like a juicy water melon wich had been struck with a heavy sludgehammer. Cold fingers gripped Jacks right arm, a re-animated body moved in for the kill,Jack backhanded his nude attacker. A buck ass redhead with a missing arm threw herself at him.Jack reacted swiftly delivering a lethal spin kick to the creatures skull.Another came at Jack clumsily walking right into his battle hardened fist.He quickly dispenced of the worthless ghoul by splitting it's skull with the fold-out stock of his SPAS 12. It was strange to him that the dirt road was so ""populated"" by the walking dead Perhaps he was nearing a town. He grabbed his battle helmet off the ground and banged it against his knee to get all the dirt out.Jack wasn't realy that big he was short and slim but tough. The rest of his platoon had been fragged by renegades wich packed serious fire power.It was a bloody skirmish wich lasted four hours, by the end of it all Jack stood atop a pile of blood soaked corpses. Golden brown shell cases were everywhere. So now he walked down the vacant dirt road wich seemed empty for as far as the eye could see. He walked another three miles until he came upon a two story house atop a hill. Five minutes later the front door had been blown off with the last of Jacks pastique. The inside was well kept and clean.He walked into the kitchen and over to the refriderator. He opened it and looked inside nothing apitizeing. Soon he felt cold steel pressing against his head ""who the **** are you?!""...."‎Jeffrey Weise
2003-04-16‎I know I can only can control a few chars',but I won't be continuing the cannibals,that was just a one time thing.I wanted to break away from Tina and Mike for a little while...‎Jeffrey Weise
2003-04-09‎"BLAM!BLAM!BLAM! One hit the ghouls chin,the other nicked it's left ear, and the third and final shot had hit it's skull dead center,right between the eye's. Tina lowered the pistol. ""That's better,""Mike said.He walked over to the ghoul tied to the tree ""about an inch to your right."" BLAM! Another well placed shot. ""Perfect,""Mike unholstered his Desert Eagle ""but hold your gun like this."" Tina watched closely,examined every move right down to how he pulled the trigger. BADAMM!BADAMM!BADAMM! All three .50 Cal slug's had hit the creatures skull with ferocous impact. Tina grinned with pleasure. Mike was getting into the habbit of using his KA-BAR knife to carve x's on the bullet slugs tips to make them stronger,and they worked perfectly.Mike kissed Tina. The two had grown to care for eachother, the 'crisis' had brought the two together,they knew eachother's deepest darkest secret's and had listened to one another's story's without getting bored are bitching. Tina had hardened emotionaly, the site of a corpse with a split skull no longer bothered her. She and Mike had came to the conclusion that they were not human and it was up to them to drop the ghouls where they stood.Mike had also become more daring, for target practice perpouses Mike had been tying down corpses. His method was to catch them off gaurd,stick a thick lead pipe in their mouths and than after restraining it putting a pillow case over their head's until they were ready to shoot. Than they would tie them up to a tree and exercise their shooting skill's. Mike and Tina had found some old surgeon books and books on the human anotomy in the fat bald guys old bedroom upstairs of the house. They studied closely figuring weak spot's and other way's to dispose of the dead with their bare hand's or a melee weapon. A few area's actualy worked,one was the hit it down by where the neck met the head with either bare fist or club because it severed the skeletal cord with the skull cutting off all mobility.It worked perfectly Another was the temples,a zombie had tackled Mike and Tina didnt have her pistol,so she grabbed a nearby rusty screw driver and jabbed it in the temple with the butt of it,the zombie went limp instantly. The worse failed one was a move they thought would kill a zombie,it was striking a ghouls nose upward with the palm wich was suposed to drive a 'bone' into it's skull suposedly killing it instantly, Mike had seen it done in thousands of kung-foo movies. He executed it perfectly, but since the nose is made out of cartelidge it's nose just lodged into it's head making it look unpleasent, but not killing it.Mike had to crush it's temples in with his bare hands pushing them into the sides of it's head as if his hands were a vicescript. Mike grabbed a meat hook and hooked the headless ghoul by the shirt and dragged him over to the edge of the hill, he gave the lifeless body a little nudge with the tip of his foot sending it down the hill. ""Com'mon,it's getting dark. We'd better get inside, ""Mike said to Tina. She nodded and they headed inside... Nearby Holigin Hospital, last occupied rescue station Riggs bit into Private Bates's fried arm. It had only been a month and the rescue station's occupants had already resorted to cannibalism. The food ration's were devoured within the first four week's of the crisis. Many people had died of starvation, dehidration, and malnutrition in the hospital, they were burned in the furnace before someone got the great idea of feasting on human flesh.Private Bates was the only sane soldier in the rescue station before his former comrades turned on him and stabbed him to death,they fried bit's of him with what little wine they had and feasted on his cooked flesh. The hospital was the largest in the state, the size of four football fields across and seven in length. It stood seven storys and even had it's own sleeping quarters for nurses and doctors who had to work long shifts. It sat at the edge of the large city wich had become a necropolis. The walking dead had turned it into a mass graveyard wich you were lucky to survive an hour in. The hospital itself was occupied by more than three thousand survivors.Most had broken off into groups and moved on to different part's of the hospital living like wild tribes.Crime was rampant in the seven storys of death.Murder,rape and other types of crimes occured almost daily. At times it seemed the city was more safe than the innards of the hospital. The group of twelve soldiers sat in a circle hunched around a flaming metal pan wich held more chunks of the human flesh their aching stomaches cried for. The men faught over every speck of greas and microscopic chunk of meat that came from the pan like wild savages,cavemen even. They were sick, they didnt have conciousnesses anymore. They were souless. Their eye's seemed black as they staired off into nothingness. They were carbon copies of the living dead wich threw themselves at the hospitals chainlink fences trying to get in,they were two and the same except these guy's had pulses and blood pumping through their veins. They had once been honorable marines who protected the hospital and encouraged morality.Now they were bottomfeeders, wild and dirty.A female cadett had once been with them, but the men had no will power and she had been continuously raped.She was alive only a weak after the men started using her. They found her dead,still tied to the pipeing on the wall.Naked and brused. Bleeding from her brutal 'sessions. 'She died from starvation and loss of blood. She became somthing of a dish after the men decided that this was the only option for survival.But survival for them soon became habbit,and they found themselves eating human flesh not just for survival,but for pleasure. What was left of Private Bates sat up, he lay on the marble floor limbless .Colonel Riggs scrambled over to him, he raised his KA-BAR knife over his head and drove it into his gaping maw pinning Bates' head to the floor. The zombie seemed confused about was was happened, he wanted the flesh of the humans that surrounded him but they seemed to want his more. He watched the biting into his raw flesh and tearing it away vicously. The predator had became the prey..."‎Jeffrey Weise
2003-04-09‎"Mike picked up Tina and brought her into the two story house. They had made it out of the suburbs and into the sticks,Mike had watched everything and everything for movement. While driving he saw nothing,nobody not even so much as a bird. The sticks were as dead as the city and the suburbs, he saw a few of them. The only house he saw fit to inhabit was a two story brown and white house with window's that were six feet from the ground, bars on the basement windows and thick steel doors wich had dead bolt's and a chain lock on them. He had secured it and searched in theroughly before deciding to move in.A large one way mirror window provided a good view for at least seven miles down the road. The tree's were bare and spread out,perfect for spotting anything coming from the sides or attempting to sneak up. The only place he hadn't checked was the basement, wich was locked from the inside. ""Where are we?,""Tina asked waking out of her sleep. ""In the stick's,you were asleep the whole drive, ""Mike gave her a bottle of water and the .45 ""I think you'll need these. The pistol is loaded and off safety, you see somthing you holler,if it's too close shoot it,and if it's one of those thing's shoot it in the head."" She nodded and took them.Mike walked away. ""Where are you goin?!, ""she blurted out with a hint of fear in her voice. ""I'm gunna' check the basement."" She nodded and sank back into the couch. Mike grabbed a hammer and philips screwdriver he had found in one of the kitcher doors and knocked the two pins in the door hinges out, the door nearly fell on him, he set the door on the floor. A nausiating smell wafted out of the basement. The basement's light was on, it was very well lit and the windows were the same as the ones up stairs,one way mirrors.He unholstered the Desert Eagle and slowly crept down the carpeted stair's.It was luxurious in the basement,patriotic paintings hung on the wall's as did trophys, a Deer's head,a bear head and a few other animal's that had been hunted and stuffed. It was a large spacious room, with a big screen TV,and three gun cases and four gun rack's with seven large steel trunks in a corner. There were four room's built into the basement,three were open and one was closed. Mike turned the door handle,it was unlocked.He pushed it open. ""Aww ****""he said to himself. The body of a teenage girl lay tied down on a bed totaly naked. Three bullet holes had tore through her skull leaving a gorey mess on the bed and around it. Another body was sitting on a la-Z-boy recliner. The body of a rotting bald fat man with a massive revolver in his right hand. His head too had been blown open, but it was a self-inflicted wound. The bullet hole in the milk white sheet rock wall sprayed with blood and brain matter told the story. He walked back up stair's and turned to Tina who sat on the couch bored. ""I need your help,""he told her. Tina followed Mike down into the basement and into the room. ""Oh god,""she said turning away in disgust. ""Yeah I know, find me some sheet's and rope, ""Mike motioned her away. Tina left up stair's to go scavenging. She soon returned and gave mike two of the sheet's,Mike used his KA-BAR knife to cut off a large peice of roop from the roll Tina had brought him. He wrapped one sheet around the stiff fat mans upper body and the other over his bottom. He double knotted the rope to ensure it would stay. sealed.He cut the arm restraint's over the teenage girls hands and legs and rolled her into one of the sheet's and did the same. They carried the two bodies up stair's and out the back door rolling them down the long hill to a creek below. Tina and mike scrubbed the blood off the floor and out of the maroon carpet.Mike washed what he could off the matress than flipped it over. ""Home sweet home,""Mike said to Tina who nodded in the affirmitve. Mike put the main basement door back up and made sure the lock's still worked. He checked the other three room's,one was another bedroom complete with dresser and hair care product's,the other's were stacked with supplies. Toilet paper, bottled water,canned food's,MRES,Nails,Boards, some blade sharpeners and last but not least,video tapes. The gun collection was amazing,rifles handguns and a few bows.Mike checked the steel trunks wich sat in one corner. ""My god"" he said to himself. The crates were filled to the brim with ammunition and explosives. ""Wow. We're set,""Tina said. The basement looked as though it had been stocked before the shit had hit the fan. Who ever the bald fat man was, he was smart.But some of the family pictures suggested he wasn't that right in the head. ""My god.That naked girl tied to the bed must have been his daughter..., ""Tina said looking at a photo."‎Jeffrey Weise
2003-03-30‎"""What?,""Mike walked over and looked at the photo. The frame was hand made in clay and had the enscription ""me and my daddy.""The picture in the frame was of the girl who had been tied down and stripped and the fat bald man. ""Sick ******* ""Mike said shaking his head in disgust. ""You hungry?I'll get us a can of somthing, ""Mike walked over to the room with the food supplys..."‎Jeffrey Weise
2003-03-28‎"Tina sat up and yawned. She stretched out and walked over to coffee pot and poured herself a cup.She sipped it while rubbing the back of her neck. ""I havent slept that peacefuly since before I became a anchorwoman,"" she said setting the coffee down on the counter and took a seat at the dining table. ""I just woke up an hour ago,Rogers been awake for a long long time...I don't even think he slept, ""Mike downed his sugar 'n creamer less coffee and set the glass down. ""I better go check,""Tina said walking down the hallway and knocking on Rogers door.""Roger,you awake?"" She slowly opened the door ""Rog-""she let out a eardrum popping shreik and ran to the bathroom.Mike came running, he stood in the doorway ""shit""Roger sat in the corner,a pool of blood around him. His wrist's each had one inch long slits in them,each had peirced major arteries.Roger's expression was still the same as when he had passed, his eyes were open and rolled back,his mouth was gaped. He still wore the expression of pain wich rigormortis had made into an eternal mold. ""He must've done this last night"" he thought. Roger didn't seem suicidal,he seemed ""ok.""Mike was still suprised he didn't come back and take advantage of the sleeping humans who were still among the living.Mike looked over to the corner were Roger had set all of his weapons ammunition,smokes and a note wich read: ""I can't take this anymore, Tina's got you Mike.She's your responsibility now. Maybe in the next lifetime I can find some peace and happiness. (P.S Put one in my head with my DE...I don't wanna come back)."" Mike picked up the KA-BAR knife that Roger had used to slit his own wrist's up and set it in it's sheate wich Roger had left in the pile with his rifles, along with the DES holster and everything else. He grabbed a white sheet from the near by bed and set it over Rogers stone cold stiff body and picked up the DE,he took ten steps back and readied the massive pistol.He checked to make sure the safety was off.He stood trying to gather enough courage to pull the trigger. A minute passed...and soon the sheet started to stir.It was Roger, he was back. Tine sat in the corner of the bathroom in a fedal posistion. Her eye's were closed tightly as she weaped.BADDAMM!Tina quickly put her hand's over her ears and bit her bottom lip BADDAMM!BADDAMM!BADDAMM! Mike stood holding the smoking pistol,three shot's had missed...one neck shot nearly popping Rogers head off... the second tore into his chest...the third grazed the ear...and the fourth and final shot had struck dead center in between the eye's.Mike rubbed his right wrist.Roger had told him the gun was powerful,how he was right. When Tina opened her eye's Mike was standing in the bathroom door way,Desert Eagle in hip holster,extra .50 cal rounds in the bullet loops.SPAS12 slung over his shoulder,KA-BAR knife in ankle sheathe and wearing sun glasses wich added to the stereotipical badass image. He walked over to her and helped her off the floor. ""I think we better get going, those gun shot's might've attracted some unwanted attention, ""Mike gave her the coat. She wiped her tears away and looked at him with her penatrating beautiful blue eyes ""Yeah."" They walked away..."‎Jeffrey Weise
2003-03-25‎"""May I ask why you've barged into my club?"" Vercetti stood before Tony. ""I come to talk business, ""Tony replied. Tommy Vercetti aproached Tony who stood at the foot of the step's. He put his arm around Tonys shoulder and walked him over to the Bar where the hot bar tender Ginger stood ready to serve them. Tommy sat and so did Tony. ""So, you wanted to see me. What about?,""Vercetti asked a little suspicous of this strange man with a broken english accent. ""I came to look for work, ""Tony replied. ""Did you now...,""Vercetti stood up ""What's your name?"" ""I Tony Montana."" ""I see..."" ""Well you don't look like a dish-washer to me, and I'm sure you aint looken' for anythin' lagit, ""Vercetti replied straightening out his colour ""Come by tommorow,I may have somethen' for you do do."" Tony nodded his head 'yes' and walked towards the exit.""F*ckin' *****, ""Tony said walking away. ""Ginger, bring me up a Martini, ""Vercetti said returning to his office. Tommy sat at his desk. ""Montana...I've heard that name before.""He picked up the phone and called Ken Rosenburg.Rosenburg answered the phone hastily,he was obviously high on crack as usual. ""Hey Rosenburg."" ""Tommy,is t-that you?hahaha!"" ""Yeah listen dip shit,have you ever heard of anyone named Tony Montana?"" Ken Rosenburg came to a pause. ""Y-yeah.He was indited for Tax fraud a month back,I was representing the state and trying to get h-him s-sentenced.I won""Rosenburg replied. ""Hahaha! That's funny,you won a case? Anyway's, who IS he?."" ""He was a real big shot before you arrived on the scene,I thought he was dead.. """‎Jeffrey Weise
2003-03-25‎"Mike gripped the Colt .45 tightly and positioned himself in the middle of the street. The ground was shaking violently,somthing big was coming. He'd rather stand there and face the thing down like a man rather than cower and be sniffed out. His eye's widened as he dove out of the way of a speeding red Cutlas supreme,he hit the pavement and rolled. The car came to a screeching hault,a breath taking blonde woman sat before him in the car behind the wheel. ""GET IN!""she shouted to him,Mike dove in through the rolled down window. The car sped off again.Mike turned around to look out the back window, there was a gigantic horde of the living dead giving chase. ""F*cking thing's been chasing me for three block's!,"" she shouted. Mike nodded in the affirmitive. ""My names Tina Kowski,you?,""she asked. Still visibly shaking but trying to get to know Mike. ""Names Mike Slater,I thought I was the only person still alive on the planet, ""Mike pulled out his gun. ""What are you gunna do?,""she asked slightly frieghtened by the sight of the pistol in a stranger's hand's. Mike handed her the pistol ""Nothing.""Mike could see she was temporarily relieved. Tina jerked the steering wheel to the side turning quickly into a driveway and into a garage,the garage door game down quickly. Another man came out of the house through the garage entrance. It was a tall white guy with dirty-blonde colored hair holding a SPAS-12.A Desert Eagle .50AE hung at his side in a black velvet hip holster. He was dressed in tactical SWAT gear. ""Come on,get in here quick!,""he said in a low tone of voice beckoning Mike and Tina to get inside. They scurried over to the enrance and the SWAT guy slammed the door shut and pushed a book case over it. ""We're safe,but we're not safe enough,""he said. Tina looked at Mike ""this is Roger"" she said pointing at the SWAT guy. Mike looked at Roger ""nice to meet you."" Roger staired at Mike suspicously. ""I found him over on 4th Avenue, ""Tina took out the .45 and handed it back to Mike. One hour later Mike and Roger sat at the kitchen table. Tina was in the living room sleeping on a lay- z-boy recliner,the curtains were drawn and the room was dimly lit. Roger took a drag of his filterless cigarette and butted it.Roger turned to Mike ""so,what were you doing on fourth?"" ""I had just gotten out from a cellar where I was hiding,spent two day's down in that cellar with another man's body.He had committed suicide, that's where I got this here .45,""Mike replied showing Roger the pistol. ""Nice gun.But I preffer this, ""Roger pulled out his massive Desert Eagle ""the ammunition is hard to find but it's alot more effective than a .45 or Glock, the recoil is a sun-of-a-*****,damn near broke my wrist when I had to fire it whilst holding it only with one hand."" Mike chuckled.""You know much about gun's?,""Roger asked.Mike shook his head no ""I've never even fired a gun in my life.I grew up in the suburbs, ""Mike stuffed the .45 in his inside coat pocket.Roger looked at Mike and started to talk ""I grew up in a family of cop's,my dad was a policeman and so was my mother. I'd alway's wait for them to come home during shift changes in the middle of the night and listen to them talk about their job's,trying to help the community,doing good 'n all. That's all bullshit these day's,nobody want's your help in the city. Everyone hates the police.I went in for training for the Special Weapons And Tactics unit,got in.I was a sniper in the gulf war,decided to keep the war going and join the force,I was a sharpshooter before the shit had hit the fan.I didn't like the job that much though,most time's you had to make split second dicisions that would change somones life forever, I didnt like that responsibility,nor did I want it."" Mike nodded ""I used to be a writer, you know,screenplays short stories.Hell someday...after all this...this might make a good movie, ""Mike said with a chuckle.He and Roger laughed as if they were old drinking buddys. All Roger's previous suspicions of Mike had dissapeared. Roger picked up a bottle of tequilia and poured some in two shot glases.He offered Mike a shot,Mike smiled and took it from him. They both bumped glasses ""Down the hatch"" Mike said.Roger grinned, they both downed their shots and slammed the glasses down onto the wooden table. ""F*ck thats good!, ""Mike said rubbing his throat.Roger poured them both another..."‎Jeffrey Weise
2003-03-25‎"Note: I'll be playing a movie character,although Vice and GTA3 were a little inspired by the movie SCARFACE in wich he was the main Character,if you've seen the movie than you'll know what is currently happening in his life P.S (Vicecity is Miami were SCARFACE took place). Hospital, ViceCity. Tony Montana laid in the hospital bed. His body had been riddled with bullets and he had suffered an almost fatal wound to the back from a close range double barrel shotgun blast.He was almost fully recovered,ever since he was a child growing up in Cuba he had a strong tolerance for pain,and that had helped in through this.Elvira sat by his bed stroking his hair. Tony woke up out of a deep sleep, Sosa's hit squad hadn't done the because he was still alive.Sosa didn't know this, but it was a good thing. Tony: Elvira,is that you? Elvira nodded her head and pushed her hair back away from her face. Elvira: I've been to the house,my god Tony what did they do to you?The FBI has seized our home Tony,they've even got the tiger. Tony shook out of it. Tony: That f*cking monkey Sosa is gunna pay for this shit! A striking brunnette walked into the room,it was Tonys doc,her name tag said ""Dr.Cipriani."" Dr.Cipriani: You're being discharged,I need one of you to sign this release form. Tony took it and noticed they had marked him down as "" Elvira took Tony out to her Cremepuff convertible and put him in the front seat she had snuck into their bullet riddled mansion and got him a few of his suit's his prized nickle plated .45,and some cash. Tony was almost a changed man from his near death expierience, he remembered being intoxicated and fighting with Elvira,than remembered Manolo.His eye's began to water thinking about his little sister Gina and his best freind since childhood Manolo. Tony: I should've let them f*cking be... Tony wiped away his tears and slammed his fist on the dash board. Tony: I killed him El...I f*cking killed him.And Gina,that Columbian f*cker Sosa,this is all his FAULT!!! Tony punched the dashboard with all his strength. Elvira: Calm down,it's ok. You'll get that ******* in time. Elvira: I've got us an apartment suite on the beach. Tony: I've got to get started again, I've got to get the money and the power, than I can get that ******* Sosa! ""I ran (so far away)"" by ""a flock of seaguls"" played on the radio. Toney rubbed his eyes and sunk into the leather apolstry listening to the song. 2 Hours later-Elvira and Tony's new Apartment Tony put on his suit.He loaded his .45 and slid it into it's arm pit holster and straightened out his colar.He stood looking at himself in the mirror,a black suit with white stripes. A white business shirt with light grey stripes going up and down it.Black pant's,and black glimmering shoes. Tony (to Elvira): I want you to stay here.I'm gunna go down to the club and talk some business. I heard there was a knew hassa in town... Tony walked out the door,he took Elira's convertible and drove down to the Malibu club. The one he had killed the Diaz brothers a month before. A guard standing by the door recognized his face and backed away quickly. Tony: You got a problem mayn? Second guard (to Tony): No no man,no problem! The second guard backed away intimadated. Tony struted into the club,music was going. People were dancing,like they had a month before when he frequently hung out there.He struted down the steps and met Fernando half way down the steps.Fernando's eyes widened and he ran for the exit.Fernando was obviously still scared about what had happened when Tony caught him trying to screw his sister Gina in the clubs boys restroom. Tony coninued to walk through the dance floor.He walked towards the bar,and towards the steps to the owners office where a big Schwartzeneger looking guard stood. Schwartzeneger-gaurd: Where the hell do you think you're going? Tony: Need to speak with the owner of the club. Schwartzeneger-gaurd: Mr. Vercetti is busy,so f*ck off. Tony: Vercetti?Mafia *****'s. You know who I am mayn?I'm Tony Montana.I used to run this f*cking town!I've been stabbed four times and shot three hundred and seventy times.Bullet's can't even stop me mayn.Now you get tha f*ck out of my way before- Mr.Vercetti: Angy,whats the problem? The big Schwartzenger guard, whose name was now Angy:Just a little problem,nothin' I can't fix. Note: I hope we can play along here guy's. made clear, Angy,turned to Vercetti."‎Jeffrey Weise

2003-03-24‎"I sat there,looking across the room at ""him.""He was down here when I had first came down to escape the horde of the undead. His name tag read: ""E Davis. ""Brain matter was sprayed generously on the concrete wall behind him.A nickle plated .45 was in his stiff yellow hands ""Mike"" I told myself, ""I've got to get that gun.""The cellar was starting to stink,bad. The corpse was about a day old when I had gotten down there. The flys were buzzing,but soon after they laid their eggs in his decomposing flesh they took off,don't know where they went. Sitting here stairing across from him I started to notice the little things. He had a ring on that finger, wich meant he had a wife somewhere. The military lab coat,and most of all the fact that he had committed suicide.The .45s barrel was stained in dark brown blood. After a few more hours I had made up my mind,my stomache was empty and the things had finaly gave up after they realised there was no way in.I stood up and put my black t-shirt over my mouth and nose and slowly crept over to him.Rigormortis had set in and he was as stiff as wire, he was like one of those wire figurines people make in art classes. His body was a masterpeice,how ever strange that might sound. A perfect ""painting"" of death's artwork. It was almost a shame to ruin it,I grabbed ahold of the Colt .45 and pryed it from his stiff boney fingers. After some work I tore the pistol away from his hands, the trigger finger was still curled around the trigger and took another fifteen minutes to get it off I took the golden wedding ring off and pocketed it,a ""reminder"" of where this life saving weapon came from. The .45 was as cold as the body I stole it from,a heavy lump in my hand.I did a quick search of his body for more ammunition, all I found was one more clip. That was enough though, I moved hastily to my corner and gasped for air. The guys stench was like sulfer and sweaty ass.Not a pleasent smell.I checked the clip that was already in the pistol,3 bullets in the clip and one in the chamber.A .45 holds six rounds, wich meant I had 3 hollow point rounds and six regular ones with unique alterations. The six normal slugs had x's carved into the tips,wich I assumed made them stronger. I grabbed a lead pipe from a pile of lumber and headed for the door atop the stairs.I sighed heavily and turned the doorknob,I pushed the door open and the bright sun light hit me in the face like a baseballbat.I raised my forearm to shield my eyes from the blinding sunlight.I reached into my knee length dark green over coat and grabbed my sun glasses.I put them on and moved for the back door wich was directly across from the basement door. I walked along the tall white fence as stealth like as possible.I hadn't seen another living person since that SWAT team guy twelve day's ago.Derelict cars line the suburbian street with a large metro transit bus parked askew in the middle of the road.I stopped to pick up a penny,funny how the little things matter to me these day's.I hear shuffling feet,a black blur on the ground slowly takes the shape of a human.I raised my head slowly to find myself looking into the eyes of a grey haired corpse.It's face was all fucked up,it's lower jaw had been blasted off,it's tounge flipped around like a fish on land. I pulled my .45 out of my coat pocket and took aim. 'CLICK!' The gun clicked,a mis-fire perhaps.No time to think because within a second this thing would be on my ass trying to take a peice of me as a suvenier.I ran over to ""him"" and swung the long lead pip like a baseball bat smacking it upside the head, it's head jerked to the left violently with a dry crack. It fell over smacking it's skull onto the pavement,it's skull caved in on impact Slimey sludge like brains oozed through the bloody cracks in it's head,my knees buckled and I feel to the ground sick to my stomache.I still wasn't used to this shit.I dry heaved as I had nothing to eat for over two day's.I pulled out the .45 again and looked at it.It was on safe,heh,I never realised these thing's had a safety button. I'm not James bond,hell, I'd never even fired a gun before. I continued to walk down the empty street...."‎Jeffrey Weise
1998-04-10‎I hate the fucking world, too much god damn fuckers in it. Too many thoughts and different societies all wrapped up together in this fucking place called AMERICA. Everyone has their own god damn opinions on every god damn thing and you may be saying “well what makes you so different?” because I have something only me and V have, SELF AWARENESS. Call it existentialism or whatever the fuck you want. We know what we are to this world and what everyone else is. We learn more than what caused the civil war and how to simplify quadratics in school. We have been watching you people. We know what you think and how you act. All talk and no actions. People who are said to be brave or courageous are usually just STUPID. Then they say later that they did it on purpose cause they are brave when they did on fucking accident. GOD everything is so corrupt and so filled with opinions and points of view and people’s own little agendas and schedules. This isn’t a world anymore. It’s HOE and no one knows it. Self awareness is a wonderful thing. I know I will die soon, so will you and everyone else. Maybe we will be lucky and a comet will smash us back to day 1. people say it is immoral to follow others, they say be a leader. Well here is a fuckin news flash for you stupid shits, everyone is a follower! Everyone who says they aren’t followers and then dresses different or acts different . . . they got that from something they saw on TV or in film or in life. No originality. How many Jo MAMMA jokes are there and how many do you think are original and not copied. KEINE. It’s a fucking filthy place we live in. All these standards and laws and great expectations are making people into robots even though they might “think” they aren’t and try to deny it. No matter how hard I try to NOT copy someone I still AM! Except for this fucking piece of paper right here, and BTW spelling is stupid unless I say, I say spell it how it sounds, it’s the fuckin easiest way! Hey try this sometime, when someone tells you something, ask “why?” eventually they will be stumped and can’t answer any more. That’s because they only know what they need to know in society and school. Not real life science. They will end up saying words = to this “because! Just shut up!” People that only know stupid facts that aren’t important should be shot, what fucking use are they. NATURAL SELECTION. Kill all retards, people with brain fuck ups, drug addicts, people who can’t figure out how to use a fucking lighter. Geeeawd! People spend millions of dollars on saving the lives of retards, and why. I don’t buy that shit like “oh, he’s my son, though!” so the fuck what, he ain’t normal, kill him. Put him out of his misery. He is only a waste of time and money, then people say “but he is worth the time, he is human too.” No he isn’t, if he was then he would swallow a bullet cause he would realize what a fucking he was.‎Eric Harris
1998-04-12‎As I said before, self-awareness is a wonderful thing. I know what all you fuckers are thinking and what to do to piss you off and make you feel bad. I always try to be different, but I always end up copying someone else. I try to be a mixture of different things and styles, but when I step out of myself I end up looking like others or others THINK I am copying. One big fucking problem is people telling me what to fuckin do, think, say, act, and everything else. I’ll do what you say IF I feel like it. But people (ie, parents, cops, God, teachers) telling me what to “do, think, say, act” makes me not want to fucking do it! That’s why my fucking name is REB!!! No one is worthy of shit unless I say they are. I feel like God and I wish I was, having everyone being OFFICIALLY lower than me. I already know that I am higher than most anyone in the fucking welt in terms of universal Intelligence. And where we stand in the universe compared to the rest of the UNIVERSE. and if you think I don’t know what I’m talking about then you can just “BUCK DICH” and saugen mein hund! Isn’t America supposed to be the land of the free? How come, If I’m free, I can’t deprive a stupid fucking dumbshit from his possessions if he leaves them sitting in the front seat of his fucking van out in plain sight and in the middle of fucking nowhere on a Frifuckingday night. NATURAL SELECTION. Fucker should be shot. Same thing with all those rich snotty toadies at my school. Fuckers think they are higher than me and everyone else with all their $ just because they were born into it? Ich denk NEIN. BTW, “sorry” is just a word. It doesn’t mean SHIT to me. Everyone should be put to a test, an ULTIMATE DOOM test, see who can survive in an environment using only ‘smarts’ and military skills. Put them in a Doom world, no authority, no refuge, no BS copout excuses. If you can’t figure out the area of a triangle or what “cation” means, you die! If you can’t take down a demon with a chainsaw or kill a hell prince with a shotgun, you die! Fucking snotty rich fuckheads who rely on others or on sympathy or $ to get them through life should be put to this challenge. Plus it would get rid of all the fat, retarded, crippled, stupid, dumb, ignorant, worthless people of this world. No one is worthy of this planet, only me and who ever I choose, there is just no respect for anything higher than your fucking boss or parent. Everyone should be shot out into space and only those people I say should be left behind.‎Eric Harris
1998-04-21‎Ever wonder why we go to school? Besides getting a so-called education. It’s not too obvious to most of you stupid fucks but for those who think a little more and deeper you should realize it. Its society’s way of turning all the young people into good little robots and factory workers. That’s why we sit in desks in rows and go by bell schedules, to get prepared for the real world cause “that’s what its like.” Well god damn it no it isn’t! one thing that separates us from other animals is the fact that we can carry actual thoughts. So why don’t we? People go on day by day routine shit. Why can’t we learn in school how we want to, why can’t we sit on desks and on shelves and put our feet up and relax while we learn? Cause that’s not what the “real world is like.” Well hey fuckheads, there is no such thing as an actual “real world.” Its just another word like justice, sorry, pity, religion, faith, luck and so on. We are humans, if we don’t like something we have the fucking ability to change! But we don’t, at least you don’t, I would. You just whine/bitch throughout life but never do a goddamn thing to change anything. “man can eat, drink, fuck, and hunt and anything else he does is madness” — Based on Lem’s quote. Boy oh fuckin boy is that true. When I go NBK and people say things like, “oh, it was so tragic,” or “oh he is crazy!” or “It was so bloody.” I think, so the fuck what you think that’s a bad thing? Just because your mumsy and dadsy told you blood and violence is bad, you think it’s a fucking law of nature? Wrong. Only science and math are true, everything, and I mean everyfuckingthing else is Man made. My doctor wants to put me on medication to stop thinking about so many things and to stop getting angry. Well, I think that anyone who doesn’t think like me is just bullshitting themselves. Try it sometime if you think you are worthy, which you probably will you little shits, drop all your beliefs and views and ideas that have been burned into your head and try to think about why your here. But I bet most of you fuckers can’t even think that deep, so that is why you must die. How dare you think that I and you are part of the same species when we are sooooooo different. You aren’t human. You are a robot. You don’t take advantage of your capabilities given to you at birth. You just drop them and hop onto the boat and head down the stream of life with all the other fuckers of your time. Well god damn it I won’t be part of it! I have thought too much, realized too much, found out too much, and I am too self aware to just stop what I am thinking and go back to society because what I do and think isn’t “right” or “morally accepted.” NO, NO, NO. God fucking damn it NO! I will sooner die than betray my own thoughts. But before I leave this worthless place, I will kill who ever I deem unfit for anything at all. Especially life. And if you pissed me off in the past, you will die if I see you. Because you might be able to piss off others and have it eventually blow over, but not me. I don’t forget people who wronged me, like . He will never get a chance to read this because he will be dead by me before this is discovered. ‎Eric Harris
1998-05-06‎The human race sucks. Human nature is smothered out by society, job, and work and school. Instincts are deleted by laws. I see people say things that contradict themselves, or people that don’t take any advantage to the gift of human life. They waste their minds on memorizing the stats of every college basketball player or how many words should be in a report when they should be using their brain on more important things. The human race isn’t worth fighting for anymore. WWII was the last war worth fighting and was the last time human life and human brains did any good and made us proud. Now, with the government having scandals and conspiracies all over the fucking place and lying to everyone all the time and with worthless, pointless, mindless, disgraceful TV shows on and with everyone ob-fucking-sessed with Hollywood and beauty and fame and glamour and politics and anything famous, people just aren’t worth saving. Society may not realize what is happening but I have; you go to school, to get used to studying and learning how your “supposed to” so that drains or filters out a little bit of human nature. But that’s after your parents taught you what’s right and wrong even though you may think differently, you still must follow the rules. After school you are expected to get a job or go to college. To have more of your human nature blown out your ass. Society tries to make everyone act the same by burying all human nature and instincts. That’s what schools, laws, jobs, and parents do. If they realize it or not. And them, the few who stick to their natural instincts are casted out as psychos or lunatics or strangers or just plain different. crazy, strange, weird, wild, these words are not bad or degrading. If humans were let to live how we would naturally, it would be chaos and anarchy and the human race wouldn’t probably last that long, but hey guess what, that’s how it’s supposed to be!!!!! Societies and government are only created to have order and calmness, which is exactly the opposite of pure human nature. Take away all your laws and morals and just see what you can do if the governments in our own little so called self-created “civilized world” and get rid of all those damn instincts everyone has!! Bullshit. I’m too tired to write anymore tonight, so until next time, fuck you all.‎Eric Harris
1998-05-09‎It has been confirmed, after getting my yearbook and watching people like and the human race isn’t worth fighting for, only worth killing. Give the Earth back to the animals, they deserve it infinitely more than we do. Nothing means anything anymore, most quotes are worthless, especially the rearranged ones like “don’t fight your enemies, make your enemies fight.” You know, quotes that use the same phrase just rearranged, Dumb fuck shit it’s funny, people say “you shouldn’t be so different” to me, and 1st I say fuck you don’t tell me what I should and shouldn’t be and 2nd mother fuckers different is good, I don’t want to be like you or anyone which is almost impossible this day with all the little shits trying to be “original copycats”, I expect shits like you to criticize anyone who isn’t one your social words, “normal” or “civilized” — see: Tempest and Caliban. All you degrading worthless shits all caught up and brainwashed into the 90’s society. “what? You AREN’T going to college, are you crazy!” holy SHIT that is one fucking BIG quote that just proves my point. Step back and look at yourself fuckers, I dare you, maybe I’ll get lucky and you’ll step back to far like Nick in E1M3 with the same consequence.‎Eric Harris
1998-05-20‎Wooh, different pen. HA! All right you pathetic fools listen up; I have figured it out. The hu- man race strives for excellence in life and community always wanting to bring more =good= into the community. And nullify “bad” things. Anyone who thinks differently than the majority or the leaders is deemed “unusual” or weird or crazy. People want to be a part of something, a family, a service, a club, a union, a community, whatever. That’s what humans want. Who cares what you as an individual thinks, you must do what you are told, whether it is jump off a bridge or drive on the right side of the road. Protesters in the past protested because the human race that was dominant (Ghandhi and the Brits or the king or the Americans) wasn’t working out = they had fault = they failed = their ideas didn’t work. Humans don’t change that much, they only get better technology to do their work quicker/easier. People always say we shouldn’t be racist. Why not? Blacks ARE different. Like it or not they are. They started out on the bottom so why not keep em there. It took them centuries to convince us that they are equal but they still use their color as an excuse or they just discriminate us because we are white. Fuck you, we should ship yer black asses back to Afrifuckingca were you came from. We brought you here and we will take you back. America = white. Gays. . . . well all gays, ALL gays, should be killed. Mit keine fragen. Lesbians are fun to watch if they are hot but still, its not human. It’s a fucking disease. You don’t see bulls or roosters trying to fuck, do you? No, I didn’t think so. Women, you will always be under men. It’s been seen throughout nature, males are almost always doing the dangerous shit while the women stay back. It’s your animal instincts, deal with it or commit suicide, just do it quick. That’s all for now.‎Eric Harris
1998-06-12‎If you recall your history the Nazis came up with a “final solution” to the Jewish problem. Kill them all. Well, in case you haven’t figured it out yet, I say “KILL MANKIND” no one should survive. We all live in lies. People are always saying they want to live in a perfect society, well utopia doesn’t exist. It is human to have flaws. You know what. Fuck it. Why should I have to explain myself to you survivors when half of this shit I say you shitheads won’t understand and if you can then woopie fucking do. That just means you have something to say as my reason for killing. And the majority of the audience won’t even understand my motives either! They’ll say “ah, he’s crazy, he’s insane, worthless! All you fuckers should die! DIE! What the fuck is the point if only some people see what I am saying, there will always be ones who don’t, ones that are to dumb or naïve or ignorant or just plain retarded. If I can’t pound it into every single persons head then it is pointless. Fuck money fuck justice fuck morals fuck civilized fuck rules fuck laws . . . DIE manmade words . . . people think they apply to everything when they don’t/can’t. There’s no such thing as True Good or True evil, it’s all relative to the observer. It’s just all nature, chemistry, and math. Deal with it. But since dealing with it seems impossible for mankind, since we have to slap warning labels on nature, then . . . you die, burn, melt, evaporate, decay. Just go the fuck away. YAAAAAA!!! “When in doubt, confuse the hell out of the enemy.” Fly 9/2/98 KEIN MITLEID wait, mercy doesn’t exist. . .‎Eric Harris
1998-06-12‎Here’s something to chew on . . . today I saw a program on the discovery channel about satellites and radar and aircraft and stuff, and at the end of the show the narrator said some things that made me think “damn, we are so advanced, we kick ass, America is awesome, we have so many things in our military, we would kick anyone’s ass.” For a minute I actually had some pride in our nation . . . then I realized, “hey, this is only the GOOD things that I am seeing here. Only the pros, not the cons. Maybe that’s what people see, only the pros, and that’s why they are under control, but me, I see all . . . you can only blind me for so long, but alas, I have realized that Yes, the human race is still indeed doomed. It just needs a few kick starts, like me, and hell, maybe even . If I can wipe a few cities off the map, and even the fuckhead holding the map, then great. Hmm, just thinking if I want all humans dead or maybe just the quote-unquote “civilized, developed, and known-of” places on Earth, maybe leave little tribes of natives in the rain forest or something. Hmm, I’ll think about that. Eh, done for tonight. REB‎Eric Harris
1998-07-29‎As part of the human race, and having the great pleasure of being blessed with a brain, I can think. Humans can do whatever they want. There is no laws of nature that prevent humans from making choices. Maybe from actually DOING some of those choices, but not from making the choice. If a man chooses to speed while driving home one day then it is his fault for whatever happens. If he crashes into a school bus full of kiddies and they all burn to death, it’s his fault. It’s only a tragedy if you think it is, and then it’s only a tragedy in your own mind so you shouldn’t expect others to think that way also. It could also be a miracle for another person maybe that bus stopped the car from plowing into a little old lady walking on the sidewalk, one could think it was a “miracle” that she wasn’t hit. You see, anything and everything that happens in our world is just that, a HAPPENING. Anything else is relative to the observer, but yet we try to have a “universal law” or “code” of what is good and bad and that just isn’t fuckin correct. We shouldn’t be allowed to do that. We aren’t GODS, just because we are at the top of the food chain with our technology doesn’t mean we can be “judges” of nature. Sure we can think what we want, but you can “think” and “behave” you can judge people and nature all you want, but you are still wrong! Why should your morals apply to everyone else. “Morals” is just another word, and that’s it. I think we are all a waste of natural resources and should be killed off, and since humans have the ability to choose . . . and I’m human . . . I think I will choose to kill and damage as much as nature allows me to so take that, fuck you, and eat napalm + lead! HA! Only nature can stop me. I know I could get shot by a cop after only killing a single person, but hey guess the fuck WHAT! I chose to kill that one person so get over it! It’s MY fault! Not my parents, not my brothers, not my friends, not my favorite bands, not computer games, not the media. IT is MINE! Go shut the fuck up! -REB- ‎Eric Harris
1998-10-23‎Someone’s bound to say “what were they thinking?” when we go NBK or when we were planning it, so this is what I am thinking. “I have a goal to destroy as much as possible so I must not be sidetracked by my feelings of sympathy, mercy, or any of that, so I will force myself to believe that everyone is just another monster from Doom like FH or FS or demons, so it’s either me or them. I have to turn off my feelings.” Keep this in mind, I want to burn the world, I want to kill everyone except about 5 people, who I will name later, so if you are reading this you are lucky you escaped my rampage because I wanted to kill you. It will be very tricky getting all of our supplies, explosives, weaponry, ammo, and then hiding it all and then actually planting it all so we can achieve our goal. But if we get busted any time, we start killing then and there, just like Wilks from the ALIENS books, I ain’t going out without a fight. Once I finally start my killing, keep this in mind, there are probably about 100 people max in the school alone who I don’t want to die, the rest, MUST FUCKING DIE! If I didn’t like you or if you pissed me off and lived through my attacks, consider yourself one lucky god damn NIGGER. Pity that a lot of the dead will be a waste in some ways, like dead hot chicks who were still bitches, they could have been good fucks. Oh well, too fucking bad. Life isn’t fair. . . . not by a long fuckin shot when I’m at the wheel, too. God I want to torch and level everything in this whole fucking area but bombs of that size are hard to make, and plus I would need a fuckin fully loaded A-10 to get every store on Wadsworth and all the buildings downtown. Heh, imagine THAT you fuckers, picture half of Denver on fire just from me and Vodka. Napalm on sides of skyscrapers and car garages blowing up from exploded gas tanks. . . . oh man that would be beautiful.‎Eric Harris
1998-11-01‎You know what, I feel like telling about lies. I lie a lot. Almost constant, and to everybody, just to keep my own ass out of the water. And by the way (side note) I don’t think I am doing this for attention, as some people may think. Let’s see, what are some big lies I have told; “yeah I stopped smoking;” “for doing it not for getting caught,” “no I haven’t been making more bombs,” “no I wouldn’t do that,” and of course, countless of other ones, and yeah I know that I hate liars and I am one myself, oh fucking well. It’s ok if I am a hypocrite, but no one else, because I am higher than you people, no matter what you say if you disagree I would shoot you. And I am one racist mother fucker too, fuck the niggers and spics and chinks, unless they are cool, but sometimes they are so fucking retarded they deserve to be ripped on. Some people go through life begging to be shot, and white fucks are just the same. If I could nuke the world I would, because so far I hate you all. There are probably around 10 people I wouldn’t want to die, but hey, who ever said life is fair should be shot like the others, too. KKK SS‎Eric Harris
1998-11-08‎Heh heh heh. I sure had fun this weekend. Let’s see, what really happened. Before going to Rock-n-Bowl we stopped by King Soopers and me and picked up some big ass stogies. We then went to Rock-n-Bowl and I had a few cigarettes and one of my brand new cigars. We then went back to ’s house where her mom had previously bought us all a fuck load of liquor. Personally I had asked for Tequila and Irish cream, Vodka got his Vodka, and there was beer, whiskey, schnapps, puckers, scotch, and of course, orange juice! So we had some fun there playing cards and making drinks. We eventually made it to bed at about 5 AM. Got up at 10, went to Safeway got some doughnuts and then I took Vodka home. The bottle of Tequila is almost full and is in my car right by my spare tire and right by the bottle of Irish Cream. Heh heh. I’ll have to find a spot for those. And by the way, this Nazi report is boosting my love of killing even more. Like the early Nazi government, my brain is like a sponge, sucking up everything that sounds cool and leaving out all that is worthless. That’s how Nazism was formed, and that’s how I will be too!‎Eric Harris
1998-11-12‎Fuck you Brady!14 All I want is a couple of guns, and thanks to your fucking bill I will probably not get any! Come on, I’ll have a clean record and I only want them for personal protection. It’s not like I’m some psycho who would go on a shooting spree. . . . fuckers. I’ll probably end up nuking everything and fucking robbing some gun collector’s house. Fuck, that’ll be hard. Oh well, just as long as I kill a lot of fucking people. Everyone is always making fun of me because of how I look, how fucking weak I am and shit, well I will get you all back, ultimate fucking revenge here. You people could have shown more respect, treated me better, asked for my knowledge or guidance more, treated me more like a senior, and maybe I wouldn’t have been so ready to tear your fucking heads off. Then again, I have always hated how I looked, I make fun of people who look like me, sometimes without even thinking sometimes just because I want to rip on myself. That’s where a lot of my hate grows from. The fact that I have practically no self-esteem, especially concerning girls and looks and such. Therefore people make fun of me . . . constantly . . . therefore I get no respect and therefore I get fucking PISSED. As of this date I have enough explosions to kill about 100 people, and then if I get a couple bayonets, swords, axes, whatever I’ll be able to kill at least 10 more. And that just isn’t enough! Guns! I need guns! Give me some fucking firearms!‎Eric Harris
1998-11-17‎HATE! I’m full of hate and I love it. I HATE PEOPLE and they better fucking fear me if they know what’s good for ’em. Yes I hate and I guess I want others to know it, yes I’m a racist and I don’t mind. Niggs and spics bring it on to themselves, and another thing, I am very racist towards white trash P.O.S.’s like and they deserve the hatred, otherwise I probably wouldn’t hate them. It’s a tragedy, the human nature of people will lead to their downfall. People’s human nature will get them killed. Whether by me or Vodka, it’s happened before, and not just school shootings like those pussy dumbasses over in Minnesota who squealed. Throughout history, its our fucking nature! I know how people are and why and I can’t stand it! I love the Nazis too . . . by the way, I fucking can’t get enough of the swastika, the SS, and the iron cross. Hitler and his head boys fucked up a few times and it cost them the war, but I love their beliefs and who they were, what they did, and what they wanted. I know that form of government couldn’t have lasted long once the human equation was brought in, but damn it, it sure looked good. Every form of government leads to downfalls, everything will always fuck up or yeah something. It’s all doomed, god damn it. This is beginning to make me get in a corner. I’m showing too much of myself, my views and thoughts, people might start to wonder, smart ones will get nosy and something might happen to fuck me over, I might need to put on one helluva mask here to fool you all some more. Fuck fuck fuck. It’ll be very fucking hard to hold out until April. If people would give me more compliments all of this might still be avoidable . . . but probably not. Whatever I do people make fun of me, and sometimes directly to my face. I’ll get revenge soon enough. Fuckers shouldn’t have ripped on me so much huh! Ha! Then again it’s human nature to do what you did . . . so I guess I am also attacking the human race. I can’t take it, it’s not right . . . true . . . correct . . . perfect. I fucking hate the human equation. Nazism would be fucking great if it weren’t for individualism and our natural instinct to ask questions. You know what maybe I just need to get laid. Maybe that’ll just change some shit around. That’s another thing, I am a fucking dog. I have fantasies of just taking someone and fucking them hard and strong. Someone like where I just pick her up, take her to my room, tear off her shirt and pants and just eat her out and fuck her hard. I love flesh . . . weisses fleisch! Dein weisses fleisch erregt mich so, Ich bin doch nur ein Gigolo! I want to grab a few different girls in my gym class, take them into a room, pull their pants off and fuck them hard. I love flesh . . . the smooth legs, the large breasts, the innocent flawless body, the eyes, the hair, jet black, blond, white, brown, ahhh I just want to fuck! Call it teenager hormones or call it a crazy fuckin racist rapist. Es ist mir egal. I just want to be surrounded by the flesh of a woman, someone like who I wanted to just fuck like hell, she made me practically drool, when she wore those shorts to work . . . instant hard on . . . I couldn’t stop staring. And others like in my gym class, or whatever in my gym class, and others who I just want to overpower and engulf myself in them. Mmm. I can taste the sweet flesh now . . . the salty sweet, the animalistic movement . . . iccchhh . . . lieeebe . . . . . . . fleisccchhhh. “Weisses fleisch” — perfect song for me. Who can I trick into my room first? I can sweep someone off their feet, tell them what they want to hear, be all nice and sweet, and then “fuck ’em like an animal, feel them from the inside” as Reznor said. Oh — that’s something else . . . that one NIN (Nine Inch Nails) video I saw, “Broken” or “Closer” or something. The one where the guy is kidnapped and tortured like hell . . . actual hell. I want to do that too. I want to tear a throat out with my own teeth like a pop can. I want to gut someone with my hand, to tear a head off and rip out the heart and lungs from the neck, to stab someone in the gut, shove it up to their heart, and yank the fucking blade out of their rib cage! I want to grab some weak little freshman and just tear them apart like a wolf, show them who is god. Strangle them, squish their head, bite their temples in the skull, rip off their jaw, rip off their collar bones, break their arms in half and twist them around, the lovely sounds of bones cracking and flesh ripping, ahhh . . . so much to do and so little chances.‎Eric Harris
1998-11-22‎Well folks, today was a very important day in the history of Reb today, along with Vodka and someone else who I won’t name, we went downtown and purchased the following: a double barrel 12 ga. Shotgun, a pump action 12 ga. Shotgun, a 9mm carbine, 250 9mm rounds, 15 12 ga slugs, 40 shotgun shells, 2 switch blade knives, and a total of 4 10-round clips for the carbine. We . . . . . . . . have . . . . . . GUNS! we fucking got them you sons of bitches! HA! HA HA HA! Neener! Booga Booga. Heh. It’s all over now. This capped it off, the point of no return. I have my carbine, shotgun, ammo and knife all in my trunk tonight and they’ll stay there till tomorrow . . . after school you know, its really a shame. I had a lot of fun at that gun show, I would have loved it if you were there Dad. We would have done some major bonding. Would have been great. Oh well. But alas, I fucked up and told about my flask. that really disappointed me . I know you thought it was good for me in the long run and all that shit, smart of you to give me such a big raise and then rat me out. You figure it was supposed to cancel each other? God damn flask, that just fucked me over bigtime. Now you all will be on my ass even more than before about being on track. I’ll get around it though. If I have to cheat and lie to everyone than that’s fine. THIS is what I am motivated for, THIS is my goal. THIS is what I want “to do with my life.” You know what’s weird, I don’t feel like punching through a door because of the flask deal, probably cause I am fucking armed. I feel more confident, stronger, more God-like. I have confidence in my ability to deceive people, hopefully I’ll make it to April, but that might not happen. Ug, its been a busy weekend, I need to sleep, I’ll continue tomorrow.‎Eric Harris
1998-12-03‎Yesterday we fired our first firearms ever. 3 rounds from the carbine. Taught that ground a thing or 2. I even had the 2 clips in my pocket while talking to Vodka’s dad about senior ditch day. God it felt great firing off that bad boy, and hopefully I’ll be able to get more than just 4 clips for it. I dubbed my shotgun “Arlene” after Arlene Sanders from the DOOM books. She always did love the shotgun. Vodka’s OB is looking fucking awesome, all cut down to the proper lengths. This is a bitch trying to keep up with homework while working on my guns, bombs, and lying. By the way, I bought that flask in the mall and I had a friend fill it up with scotch whiskey, only had about 3 swigs in the 3 weeks I had it. Plus Monday I gave my T and IC to Vodka, just in case. I never really did like alcohol, just wasn’t my thing, but it felt good to just have around. That argument on the 22nd was a real bitch, but I think I should have won a fucking Oscar. I even quoted a few movies, remember “what the hell am I gonna do now man?! What am I gonna do!?” that’s good ole Hudson from “Aliens.” Sounded good too. And hey god damn it I would have been a fucking great marine. It would have give me a reason to do good. And I would never drink and drive, either. It will be weird when we actually go on the rampage. Hopefully we will have plenty of clips and bombs. I’m gonna still try and get my calico 9mm. Just think, 100 rounds without reloading. . . . hell yeah! We actually may have a chance to get some machine pistols thanks to the Brady bill. If we can save up about $200 real quick and find someone who is 21+ we can go to the next gun show and find a private dealer and buy ourselves some bad-ass AB-10 machine pistols. Clips for those things can get really fucking bit too.‎Eric Harris
1998-12-17‎woohoo, I’ll never have to take a final again! Feels good to be free. I just love Hobbes and Nietzsche. Well tomorrow I’ll be ordering 9 more 10-round clips for my carbine. I’m gonna be so fucking loaded in about a month. The big things we need to figure out now is the time bombs for the commons and how we will get them in and leave them there to go off, without any fuckin Jews finding them. I wonder if anyone will write a book on me. Sure is a ton of symbolism, double meanings, themes, appearance vs. reality shit going on here. Oh well, it better be fuckin good if it is written.‎Eric Harris
1998-12-20‎Heh, get this. KMFDM’s new album’s entitled “Adios” and its release date is in April. How fuckin appropriate, a subliminal final “Adios” tribute to Reb and Vodka, thanks KMFDM . . . I ripped the hell outa the system.‎Eric Harris
1998-12-29‎Jesus christ that was fucking close. Fucking shitheads at the gunshop almost dropped the whole project. Oh well, thank god I can BS so fucking well. I went and picked up those babies today, so now I got 13 of those niggers woohah. The stereo is very nice, but having no insurance payments to worry about so I could concentrate of BOMBS would have been better. Oh well, I think I’ll have enough. Now I just need to get Vodka another gun.‎Eric Harris
1999-04-03‎Months have passed. It’s the first Friday night in the final month. Much shit has happened. Vodka has a Tec 9, we test fired all of our babies, we have 6 time clocks ready, 39 crickets 24 pipe bombs, and the napalm is under construction. Right now I’m trying to get fucked and trying to finish off these time bombs. NBK came quick, why the fuck can’t I get any? I mean, I’m nice and considerate and all that shit, but nooooo. I think I try too hard. But I kinda need to, considering NBK is closing in. The amount of dramatic irony and foreshadowing is fucking amazing. Everything I see and hear I incorporate into NBK somehow. Either bombs, clocks, guns, napalm, killing people, any and everything finds some tie to it. Feels like a goddamn movie sometimes. I wanna try to put some mines and trip bombs around this town too maybe. Get a few extra frags on the scoreboard. I hate you people for leaving me out of so many fun things. And no don’t fucking say “well that’s your fault” because it isn’t, you people had my phone #, and I asked and all, but no. no no no don’t let the weird looking Eric KID come along, ooh fucking nooo.‎Eric Harris
‎I HATE trends!‎Eric Harris
‎people say it is immoral to follow others, they say be a leader. Well here is a fuckin news flash for you stupid shits, everyone is a follower! Everyone who says they aren’t followers and then dresses diff or acts diff. . ..they got that from something they saw on TV or in film or in life. No originality. How many Jo MAMMA jokes are there and how many do you think are original and not copied. KEINE. It’s a fucking filthy place we live in. All these standards and laws and great expectations are making people into robots even though they might “think” they aren’t and try to deny it. No matter how hard I try to NOT copy someone I still AM!‎Eric Harris
‎I always try to be different, but I always end up copying someone else.‎Eric Harris
‎ever wonder why we go to school? Besides getting a so-called education. It’s not too obvious to most of you stupid fucks but for those who think a little more and deeper you should realize it. Its society’s way of turning all the young people into good little robots.‎Eric Harris
‎I bet most of you fuckers can’t even think that deep . . . You aren’t human. You are a robot.‎Eric Harris
‎I don’t want to be like you or anyone which is almost impossible.‎Eric Harris
‎today I saw a program on the discovery channel about satellites and radar and aircraft and stuff, and at the end of the show the narrator said some things that made me think “damn, we are so advanced, we kick ass, America is awesome, we have so many things in our military, we would kick anyone’s ass.” For a minute I actually had some pride in our nation. . .then I realized, “hey, this is only the GOOD things that I am seeing here. Only the pros, not the cons. Maybe that’s what people see, only the Pros, and that’s why they are under control, but me, I see all.‎Eric Harris
‎Everything others do always will affect us, no matter what we think.‎Eric Harris
‎In this day and age, it is almost impossible to be original.‎Eric Harris
‎People do act on and believe in what they see, but they are still influenced by others.‎Eric Harris
‎My thoughts are the most original and distinctive part of my character.‎Eric Harris
‎It can be hard to be original in our generation.‎Eric Harris
‎My mind is so full of creative, original ideas that sometimes I have trouble keeping them at bay.‎Eric Harris
‎It is hard to describe my creative talents and to be sure that they are original.‎Eric Harris
‎Different people influence my life in different ways. Therefore it is important to learn how exactly they influence me.‎Eric Harris
‎Zeus and I both like to be powerful and have some control over what is happening. I am always asking questions or double-checking myself to be sure I completely understand something so I am in control.‎Eric Harris
‎Why are they sooo original!! If it’s made in a factory it’s not very freaking original!!‎Eric Harris
‎God damn trends!! Why are they sooo original!! If its made in a factory its not very freakin original!!‎Eric Harris
‎Do not think we’re trying to copy anyone. We had the idea before the first one ever happened.‎Eric Harris
‎Natural selection needs a boost, like me with a shotgun.‎Eric Harris
‎YOU KNOW WHAT I LOVE!!!? Natural SELECTION!!!!!!!!! God damn it’s the best thing that ever happened to the Earth. Getting rid of all the stupid and weak organisms. . .. . .but its all natural!!! YES! I wish the government would just take off every warning label. So then all the dumbasses would either severely hurt themselves or DIE! And boom, no more dumbasses.‎Eric Harris
‎You all better fucking hide in your houses because I’m comin for EVERYONE soon, and I WILL be armed to the fuckin teeth and I WILL shoot to kill and I WILL fuckin KILL EVERYTHING!‎Eric Harris
‎NATURAL SELECTION. Kill all retards, people with brain fuck ups, drug addicts, people who can’t figure out how to use a fucking lighter. Geeeawd! People spend millions of dollars on saving the lives of retards, and why. I don’t buy that shit like “oh, he’s my son, though!” so the fuck what, he ain’t normal, kill him. Put him out of his misery. He is only a waste of time and money, then people say ‘but he is worth the time, he is human too.’ No he isn’t, if he was then he would swallow a bullet cause he would realize what a fucking he was.‎Eric Harris
‎NATURAL SELECTION. Fucker should be shot. Same thing with all those rich snotty toadies at my school. Fuckers think they are higher than me and everyone else with all their $ just because they were born into it? Ich denk NEIN . . . Everyone should be put to a test, an ULTIMATE DOOM test, see who can survive in an environment using only ‘smarts’ and military skills. Put them in a Doom world, no authority, no refuge, no BS copout excuses. If you can’t figure out the area of a triangle or what “cation” means, you die! If you can’t take down a demon with a chainsaw or kill a hell prince with a shotgun, you die! Fucking snotty rich fuckheads who rely on others or on sympathy or $ to get them through life should be put to this challenge. Plus it would get rid of all the fat, retarded, crippled, stupid, dumb, ignorant, worthless people of this world. No one is worthy of this planet, only me and who ever I choose . . . Everyone should be shot out into space and only those people I say should be left behind.‎Eric Harris
‎But before I leave this worthless place, I will kill who ever I deem unfit for anything at all. Especially life.‎Eric Harris
‎The human race isn’t worth fighting for, only worth killing.‎Eric Harris
‎since we have to slap warning labels on nature, then . . . you die, burn, melt, evaporate, decay. Just go the fuck away. YAAAAAA!!!‎Eric Harris
‎If you recall your history the Nazis came up with a “final solution” to the Jewish problem. Kill them all. Well, in case you haven’t figured it out yet, I say “KILL MANKIND” no one should survive.‎Eric Harris
‎If I can wipe a few cities off the map, and even the fuckhead holding the map, then great. Hmm, just thinking if I want all humans dead or maybe just the quote-unquote ‘civilized, developed, and known-of’ places on Earth, maybe leave little tribes of natives in the rain forest or something. Hmm, I’ll think about that.‎Eric Harris
‎I think we are all a waste of natural resources and should be killed off.‎Eric Harris
‎I want to kill everyone except about 5 people.‎Eric Harris
‎If I could nuke the world I would, because so far I hate you all. There are probably around 10 people I wouldn’t want to die.‎Eric Harris
‎What’s 35% of 100? 1. 35 2. Germany France Spain Italy 3. Kansas Wyoming Nebraska Arizona I think that this is absolutely ridiculous, people who can’t answer questions like that should be shot.‎Eric Harris
‎I think students today are astonishingly stupid. It never ceases to amaze me how stupid and ignorant people can be. Seems like some try to be dumb. It’s a pity natural selection doesn’t apply to humans, otherwise I strongly believe the race as a whole would be better off.‎Eric Harris
‎It would be great if god removed all vaccines and warning labels from everything in the world and let natural selection take its course. All the fat ugly retarded crippled dumbass stupid fuckheads in the world would die. . .Maybe then the human race can actually be proud of itself . . . NBK. I love it! sometime in april me and V will get revenge and will kick natural selection up a few notches‎Eric Harris
‎You know what I HATE!!? MANKIND!!!! YeaaAAAAAAAH! Kill everything . . . kill everything.‎Eric Harris
‎i would love to be the ultimate judge and say if a person lives or dies . . . and say ‘you don’t deserve to live, you are worthless, die.‎Eric Harris
‎I think I would want us to go extinct.‎Eric Harris
‎Retards!!! They are a waste of time and money and effort and energy and space and lots of other stuff too! They need to DIE!!‎Eric Harris
‎Ich bin Gott‎Eric Harris
‎Ich bin Gott‎Eric Harris
‎Harris goes on to film his planning book and describes it as the ‘Writings of God.’‎Eric Harris
‎My belief is that if I say something, it goes. I am the law. If you don’t like it, you die.‎Eric Harris
‎Ich bin Gott‎Eric Harris
‎I feel like God and I wish I was, having everyone being OFFICIALLY lower than me. I already know that I am higher than most anyone in the fucking welt in terms of universal Intelligence. And where we stand in the universe compared to the rest of the UNIVERSE.‎Eric Harris
‎How dare you think that I and you are part of the same species when we are sooooooo different. You aren’t human. You are a robot.‎Eric Harris
‎they are under control, but me, I see all.‎Eric Harris
‎It’s ok if I am a hypocrite, but no one else, because I am higher than you people.‎Eric Harris
‎I want to grab some weak little freshman and just tear them apart like a wolf, show them who is god.‎Eric Harris
‎I am fucking armed. I feel more confident, stronger, more God-like.‎Eric Harris
‎Ich bin Gott‎Eric Harris
‎One looked like a World War II marine propaganda poster, except it read KMFDM on the top of it. Another had a pure American bald eagle, another said God-like.‎Eric Harris
‎I think students today are astonishingly stupid. It never ceases to amaze me how stupid and ignorant people can be . . . I am ashamed to be a part of the same species as some of these people.‎Eric Harris
‎You and me are the ones who should be running the world.‎Eric Harris
‎I would love to be the ultimate judge and say if a person lives or dies — be godlike.‎Eric Harris
‎I don’t want to brag about my own sh*t, but these levels come from the Herrgott of DOOM himself . . . Each level has 4 symbols in it, locate all of them and you are Godlike.‎Eric Harris
‎Ich bin Gott‎Eric Harris
‎most people “will not see the new world.‎Eric Harris
‎Eric wrote about his activities as taking place in “the pre-war era.‎Eric Harris
‎When I go NBK and people say things like, “oh, it was so tragic,” or “oh he is crazy!” or “It was so bloody.” I think, so the fuck what you think that’s a bad thing?‎Eric Harris
‎the human race is still indeed doomed. It just needs a few kick starts, like me.‎Eric Harris
‎Someone’s bound to say ‘what were they thinking?’ when we go NBK or when we were planning it, so this is what I am thinking. ‘I have a goal to destroy as much as possible.’‎Eric Harris
‎Once I finally start my killing, keep this in mind, there are probably about 100 people max in the school alone who I don’t want to die, the rest, MUST FUCKING DIE!‎Eric Harris
‎THIS is what I am motivated for, THIS is my goal. THIS is what I want ‘to do with my life.’‎Eric Harris
‎NBK came quick, why the fuck can’t I get any? I mean, I’m nice and considerate and all that shit, but nooooo. I think I try to hard. But I kinda need to, considering NBK is closing in.‎Eric Harris
‎NBK. I love it! Sometime in april me and V will get revenge and kick natural selection up a few notches. . .maybe we will even start a little rebellion or revolution to fuck things up as much as we can.‎Eric Harris
‎God I can’t wait till they die. I can taste the blood now. NBK und KMFDM.‎Eric Harris
‎You all need to die! We need to die, too! We need to fucking kick-start the revolution here! . . . We need a fucking kick-start. If we have a fucking religious war — or oil — or anything. We need to get a chain reaction going here.‎Eric Harris
‎Our actions are a two man war against everyone else.‎Eric Harris
‎I really am sorry about all of this . . . but war’s war‎Eric Harris
‎there’s a cop — let’s get that cop‎Eric Harris
‎let’s go kill some cops now‎Eric Harris
‎All these standards and laws and great expectations are making people into robots.‎Eric Harris
‎People (ie, parents, cops, God, teachers) telling me what to makes me not want to fucking do it!‎Eric Harris
‎Society tries to make everyone act the same by burying all human nature and instincts. That’s what schools, laws, jobs, and parents do.‎Eric Harris
‎Fuck money fuck justice fuck morals fuck civilized fuck rules fuck laws.‎Eric Harris
‎we try to have a ‘universal law’ or ‘code’ of what is good and bad and that just isn’t fuckin correct.‎Eric Harris
‎I know I could get shot by a cop after only killing a single person, but hey guess the fuck WHAT! I chose to kill that person.‎Eric Harris
‎By that time cops will be all over us and we start to kill them too!‎Eric Harris
‎cops! Stupid law enforcing people!!!‎Eric Harris
‎The ONE person you hate the most: “are cops one person?”‎Eric Harris
‎Don’t follow your dreams or goals or any of that shit, follow your fucking animal instincts. If it moves, kill it, if it doesn’t, burn it.‎Eric Harris
‎Human nature is smothered out by society, job, and work and school. Instincts are deleted by laws.‎Eric Harris
‎Society tries to make everyone act the same by burying all human nature and instincts. That’s what schools, laws, jobs, and parents do . . . the few who stick to their natural instincts are casted out as psychos or lunatics or strangers or just plain different. Crazy, strange, weird, wild, these words are not bad or degrading. If humans were let to live how we would naturally, it would be chaos and anarchy and the human race wouldn’t probably last that long, but hey guess what, that’s how its supposed to be!!!!! Societies and government are only created to have order and calmness, which is exactly the opposite of pure human nature.‎Eric Harris
‎Women, you will always be under men. It’s been seen throughout nature, males are almost always doing the dangerous shit while the women stay back. It’s your animal instincts.‎Eric Harris
‎I really don’t give a good god damn about what you think is ‘right’ and what is ‘wrong’ and what is acceptable and what isn’t nice, I just don’t fucking CARE! SHUTUP AND DIE!!!!!!!‎Eric Harris
‎No I am not crazy, crazy is just a word, to me it has no meaning.‎Eric Harris
‎Sorry is just a word.‎Eric Harris
‎There is no such thing as an actual ‘real world.’ Its just another word like justice, sorry, pity, religion, faith, luck and so on.‎Eric Harris
‎Just because your mumsy and dadsy told you blood and violence is bad, you think it’s a fucking law of nature? Wrong.‎Eric Harris
‎your social words, ‘normal’ or ‘civilized’‎Eric Harris
‎Fuck money, fuck justice, fuck morals, fuck civilized, fuck rules, fuck laws. . .DIE manmade words . . . There’s no such thing as True Good or True evil.‎Eric Harris
‎‘Morals’ is just another word, and that’s it.‎Eric Harris
‎Bloody snotty people think they are god almighty.‎Eric Harris
‎I will rig up explosives all over a town and detonate each one of them at will after I mow down a whole fucking area of you snotty ass rich mother fucking high strung godlike attitude having worthless pieces of shit whores.‎Eric Harris
‎All those rich snotty toadies at my school. Fuckers think they are higher than me and everyone else with all their $ just because they were born into it.‎Eric Harris
‎Fucking snotty rich fuckheads who rely on others or on sympathy or $ to get them through life.‎Eric Harris
‎Young smokers! They think they are so god damn cool with their big bad cigarettes and their ‘sooo cool’ attitude.‎Eric Harris
‎You know what I hate!!!? People who think they can forecast the weather!!! Then they think that everyone else will think that they are cool.‎Eric Harris
‎People who think they are martial arts experts! They are all cocky and thinking they are all big and bad.‎Eric Harris
‎You know what I hate!!!? Rappers and their oh so smooth cool suave rapper attitude.‎Eric Harris
‎People who like SKA give the rest of the human race a bad name!! They think they are soooo cool.‎Eric Harris
‎hanson!!! Stupid little posers who think they are cool!‎Eric Harris
‎YOU KNOW WHAT I LOVE!!!? When some stupid retarded kid blows his hand off because he couldn’t figure out that a lit fuse means that the firecracker is going to go off soon! HAHAHA!!‎Eric Harris
‎YOU KNOW WHAT I HATE!! RACISM!! Anyone who believes that blacks, Asians, Mexicans, or people from any other country or race besides white-American . . . people who think that should be drug out into the street, have their arms ripped off, be be burnt at the stumps, then have every person of the race that YOU hate come out and beat the shit out of you, and if you are female, then you should be raped by a male from the race you hate and be forced to raise the child!‎Eric Harris
‎Maybe I just need to get laid. Maybe that’ll just change some shit around. That’s another thing, I am a fucking dog. I have fantasies of just taking someone and fucking them hard and strong. Someone like where I just pick her up, take her to my room, tear off her shirt and pants and just eat her out and fuck her hard . . . I want to grab a few different girls in my gym class, take them into a room, pull their pants off and fuck them hard. I love flesh . . . the smooth legs, the large breasts, the innocent flawless body, the eyes, the hair, jet black, blond, white, brown, ahhh I just want to fuck! Call it teenager hormones or call it a crazy fuckin racist rapist.‎Eric Harris
‎I just want to overpower and engulf myself in them . . . Who can I trick into my room first? I can sweep someone off their feet, tell them what they want to hear, be all nice and sweet, and then ‘fuck ’em like an animal, feel them from the inside’ as Reznor said. Oh — that’s something else . . . that one NIN video I saw, ‘Broken’ or ‘Closer’ or something. The one where the guy is kidnapped and tortured like hell . . . actual hell. I want to do that too. I want to tear a throat out with my own teeth like a pop can. I want to gut someone with my hand, to tear a head off and rip out the heart and lungs from the neck, to stab someone in the gut, shove it up to their heart, and yank the fucking blade out of their rib cage! I want to grab some weak little freshman and just tear them apart like a wolf, show them who is god. Strangle them, squish their head, bite their temples in the skull, rip off their jaw, rip off their collar bones, break their arms in half and twist them around, the lovely sounds of bones cracking and flesh ripping, ahhh . . . so much to do and so little chances.‎Eric Harris
‎First we will go to the house of and in the morning before school starts and before anyone is even awake. We go in, we silently kill each inhabitant and then pin down and . Then take our sweet time pissing on them, spitting on them, and just torturing the hell out of them.‎Eric Harris
‎YOU KNOW WHAT I HATE!!!? HOMOSEXUALS!! It is just plain WRONG.‎Eric Harris
‎People always say we shouldn’t be racist. Why not? Blacks ARE different. Like it or not they are. They started out on the bottom so why not keep em there. It took them centuries to convince us that they are equal but they still use their color as an excuse or they just discriminate us because we are white. Fuck you, we should ship yer black asses back to Afrifuckingca were you came from. We brought you here and we will take you back. America = white. Gays . . . well all gays, ALL gays, should be killed. Mit keine fragen. Lesbians are fun to watch if they are hot but still, its not human. It’s a fucking disease. You don’t see bulls or roosters trying to fuck, do you? No, I didn’t think so. Women, you will always be under men. It’s been seen throughout nature, males are almost always doing the dangerous shit while the women stay back. It’s your animal instincts, deal with it or commit suicide, just do it quick.‎Eric Harris
‎If you recall your history the Nazis came up with a ‘final solution’ to the Jewish problem. Kill them all. Well, in case you haven’t figured it out yet, I say ‘KILL MANKIND’ no one should survive.‎Eric Harris
‎If I didn’t like you or if you pissed me off and lived through my attacks, consider yourself one lucky god damn NIGGER.‎Eric Harris
‎I am one racist mother fucker too, fuck the niggers and spics and chinks, unless they are cool, but sometimes they are so fucking retarded they deserve to be ripped on.‎Eric Harris
‎KKK SS‎Eric Harris
‎by the way, this Nazi report is boosting my love of killing even more. Like the early Nazi government, my brain is like a sponge, sucking up everything that sounds cool and leaving out all that is worthless. That’s how Nazism was formed, and that’s how I will be too!‎Eric Harris
‎I’m a racist and I don’t mind. Niggs and spics bring it on to themselves.‎Eric Harris
‎I love the Nazis too . . . by the way, I fucking can’t get enough of the swastika, the SS, and the iron cross. Hitler and his head boys fucked up a few times and it cost them the war, but I love their beliefs and who they were, what they did, and what they wanted. I know that form of government couldn’t have lasted long once the human equation was brought in, but damn it, it sure looked good.‎Eric Harris
‎Nazism would be fucking great if it weren’t for individualism and our natural instinct to ask questions.‎Eric Harris
‎The big things we need to figure out now is the time bombs for the commons and how we will get them in and leave them there to go off, without any fuckin Jews finding them.‎Eric Harris
‎I hate this kind of fuckin music. Goddamn white bushy apes and spear chuckers snappin their gay little fingers and tapping their faggot little shoes. . . their gay little nightclub. . . no jungle bunnies running around banging on things.‎Eric Harris
‎Supa Nigga!‎Eric Harris
‎"Philosophy: My belief is that if I say something, it goes. I am the law, if you don't like it, you die. If I don't like you or I don't like what you want me to do, you die. If I do something incorrect, oh fucking well, you die. Dead people cant do many things, like argue, whine, bitch, complain, narc, rat out, criticize, or even fucking talk. So thats the only way to solve arguments with all you fuckheads out there, I just kill! God I cant wait till I can kill you people. Ill just go to some downtown area in some big ass city and blow up and shoot everything I can. Feel no remorse, no sense of shame. Ich sa ge FICKT DU! I will rig up explosives all over a town and detonate each one of them at will after I mow down a whole fucking area full of you snotty ass rich mother fucking high strung godlike attitude having worthless pieces of shit whores. i don't care if I live or die in the shootout, all I want to do is kill and injure as many of you pricks as I can, especially a few people. Like brooks brown. America: Love it or leave it mother fuckers. All you racist (and if you think im a hypocrite, come here so I can kill you) mother fucking assholes in America who burn our flags and disgrace my land, GET OUT! And to you assholes in iraq and iran and all those other little piece of shit desert lands who hate us, shut up and die! We will kick your ass if you try to fuck with us or atleast I will! I may not like or government or the people running it or things like that, but the physical land and location I DO fucking love! So love it or leave it! Society: I live in denver, and god damnit I would love to kill almost all of its residents. Fucking people with their rich snobby attitude thinkin they are all high and mighty and can just come up and tell me what to do and then people I see in the streets lying their fucking asses off about themselves. And then there is all you fitness fuck heads saying shit like ""yeah do 50 situps and 25 pushups each morning and run a mile every day and go to the gym and work out and just push yourself to be better and you can achieve anything and set high goals and have great expectations and be happy and be kind and treat everyone equal and give to charity and help the poor and stop violence and drive sately and don't pollute and don't litter and cake shorter showers and don't waste water and eat right food and don't smoke or drink and don't sell guns and don't be a bad person""...phew. I say ""fuck you...shutup...and die..."" And then pull the trigger of a DB#3 that is in your fucking mouth. All you fucking people with your set standards and shit, like you have to go to college and be smart and shit, and you have to have a job and pay taxes, blah blah fucking blah, shutup and DIE! I really don't give a good god damn about what you think is ""right"" and what is ""wrong"" and what is acceptable and what isnt nice, I just don't fucking CARE! SHUTUP AND DIE!!!!!!!"‎Eric Harris
‎Wie gehts. Well all you people out there can just kiss my ass and die. From now on I don't give a fuck what almost any of you mutha fuckas have to say, unless i respect you which is highly unlikely, but for those of you who happen to know me and know that i respect you, may piece be with you and dont be in my line of fire. for the rest of you, you all better fucking hide in your houses because im comin for everyone soon, and i WILL be armed to the fuckin teeth and i WILL shoot to kill and i WILL fucking KILL EVERYTHING! No i am not crazy. crazy is just a word. to me it has no meaning. everyone is different. but most of you fuckheads out there in society, going to your everyday fucking jobs and doing your everyday routine shitty things, i say fuck you and die. if you got a problem with my thoughts, come tell me and ill kill you, because.........god damnit, DEAD PEOPLE DONT ARGUE! God DAMNIT I AM PISSED!!‎Eric Harris

‎NEXT MISSION=aaaan whenever. Ok people, im gonna let you in on the big secret of our clan. We aint no god damn stupid ass quake clan! We are more of a gang. We plan out and execute missions. Anyone pisses us off, we do a little deed to their house. Eggs, teepee, superglue, busyboxes, large amounts of fireworks, you name it and we will probly or already have done it. We have many enimies in our school, therefor we make many missions. Its sort of a night time tradition for us. Download CORRIDOR.MAP. Its a very close replica of the mission sites. But we have never seen the inside of the house...so we just guessed. Its also cut off where the area isnt important (ya know, i didnt want to put in all of the neighborhood:). The mission has been done. And the rebels...once again...emerged victorious. Vee talking blew de sheeeit outta lossa stocf!! As for the next mission, we havent decided what to do or where to do it. I had some thoughts about hiding in some large bushes or trees and shooting stuff. or maybe some more arial attacks. But we need to go up to Wyoming and load up on that stuff. We are running low. Plus we just got our paychecks....they arent big...but they can cover quite a bit of shit. We still need to get the fuses too. So far, the next mission will probly be in July sometime. But we AINT SURE. :MISSION LOGS:‎Eric Harris
‎"6: Awwww yeya. This mission was so fuckin fun man. ok, first of all, my dad was the only parent home, so it was much easier getting out...but still hard since all these rocks in my backyard make so much noise. Plus the neighbors faulting dog barking its faulting head off. First we went through the corridor...going through some very tall grass fields...not as tall as the ones in the Lost World, but close. Felt kinda cool. Then we set up the strip of 1132 fire crackers. Using 2 ciggarettes as starting fuses, we had plenty of time to spare. We also had a nice little crackering fountain hooked up to the fuses too. After a few minutes of setting it up, we lit it and went over and hid in ontop of this big cement pipe going under a street. We were on the side of a hill so we hid in the grass. There was also a full moon that night, and not a foaming cloud in the sky. So it was like noon on the equator when we were out in the open. But, black clothing and tall grass sure helps. After about 5 minutes (forever) it began. Beforehand we watched as some lights in the Targets house went on.....then off. Maybe the bastard heard something. But when the strip started, he turned his bedroom lights off. The strip lasted for about 30 seconds.....we think...it was very fucking long. almost all of it went off. loud and bright. everything worked exactly how we wanted it to. After about 15 minutes we started down the bike trail to the next target. The first targets lights were on again in the bedroom, but we think we got away undetected. While we were walking to the next target, we shot some stuff. Heh, VoDkA brought his sawed off BBgun and a few BB's too. So we loaded it, pumped it, and fired off a few shots at some houses and trees and stuff. We probably didnt do any damage to any houses, but we arent sure. The gun was not loud at all, which was very good. At the next target, we set up the saturn missle battery and the rockets. These both has fuses about 2-3 feet long. I lit them as VoDkA and KiBBz were over hiding in the shadows. Luckily there were some trees and stuff at the 2nd target so we could hide pretty good. Anyway, i lit and went over to the others. We watched as the fuses burned and burned...then the rockets went off. It was pretty nice, not so much ment as a prank, but more as a nice little fireworks show. They made some noise, but nothing to shit yer pants about. But the battery didnt werk. So i went back, checked it out, and the fuse had burned down to about 2 inches, so I just said up yours baby and lit it. right as i made it to the others it went off. It was pretty quick, and loud too. Since the missiles are whistlers, they probly woke up a few residents. YEY. Then we started heading up to this construction site. Its right on the side of a kinda busy road, but before the houses. We dodged a few cars, messed around at the site. And we also swiped some signs from this fence that was put up around the soon-to-be-foundation of whatever is being built. The signs read ""RENT-A-FENCE"" and had some 1 800 number on them. So we got some very nice souvoneers (spelled close enuf) from that place. Then, as KIBBz and VoDkA were down in the foundation hole and I was up ontop, a cop drove by. We had enough time to see it, take cover, and watch it go by, so it didnt get us by suprise. But once we saw it was a cop we decided it was time to farming LEAVE. He didnt stop, he drove right by, but shit he mighta been looking for us. So we got out of the fence, grabbed our signs and went to the neighborhood again. We didnt have that much trouble getting back home, just some dogs and shit. Once we got in, we were tired as a priest after a 5 hour orgy. The total mission took about 3 hours. We left around 12:30 and got back around 3-3:30. We arent very sure but it lasted a while. And damit, it was well worth it. We needed that mission too, we were all pretty tired of waiting and our nerves were just about shot. So it was perdy relaxing to be free like that. "‎Eric Harris
‎5 This mission was one of the best we ever did. This was from Kibbz's house to several locations in his neighborhood. That night was probly the longest walk we ever did. First we went to this soccer field/playground. It was right on the corner of a very busy intersection. So every minute we had cars goin by. There was a lot of moonlight that night, We got to the playground and dodged the lights of cars for about 20 minutes. Then we decided what our first strike would be like. We got a big McD's cup, and went to center field of the soccer field. We got out aobut 20 bottlerockets that were stripped together, and a 100somethin strip of blackcats. Each had very good and long fuses so we had lots of time. We lit them, and ran over and got in front of these big pine trees. We were totally out of vision. The rockets went off first. They launched out over the field and then the strip went off, after that we started goin back the way we came. Which went through this trail about 35yards wide with houses on either side. We found this large metal tub...perfect for firecrackers!!! We decided that Kibbz and Vodka would walk off toward the street on the other side of the trail and hide behind some trees while i lit it. Except...the street was over 100 yards away. And they were aobut 15yards past it. Once they signaled me, I lit the small assortment of thunderbombs and about 50 stickless bottle rockets. They would only make sound, no visual effects. But anyway, I lit and sprinted the whole f*ckin way. About 3/4ths the way the fireworks went off, I was right in the middle of this bigass trail. I never ran so fast in all the missions. But I made it to the others and watched all these lights go on from the houses. Then we walked over to this big open hill between some houses and a busy street. We got a long wooden board and placed it on the hill. We had a long strip of about 200 and a little brick of about 3 packs of thunderbombs. This time we used a cigarette fuse. we only neeeded about an inch of it. We lit the cigarette and went over to hide behind some trees. When it went off it was VERY loud where we were so we bolted outa there. After a few minutes we went back to see if all the stuff had gone off and it all did. So we got some souvaneers (i know misspelled) and went home. Drank some Aftershock that night too. We were supposed to have a few chicks come with us, but they couldnt make it...so may be next time.‎Eric Harris
‎"4 This mission was frehkin unique. The mission was from my house (REB), through the corridor, past the graves, and to the place where we do all of our fireworks. It was supposed to be like the other missions to this place. The weather was nice, we had 4 items made up and ready for use. The first fuse didnt work. The second fuse malfunctioned also. Both of those items were just about 100-120 thunderbombs stripped together. We had one more like the first 2 and we also had a little contraption of bottlerockets. These bottle rockets were stripped together, and put into a bottle. We placed this bottle on top of a large hill. So quite a few people could see. After about the 3rd try, I decided to just light the fuses that were directly from the rockets. Usually we use loooong fuses so we have time to get away. But this time, with Vodka and Kibbz standing over infront of some bigass shrubbery. I just did the direct fuse. After lighting it i ran like a sonuvabitch to Vodka and Kibbz. By the time i made it to them the rockets were starting to go off. We had aobut 50 in the assortment, so it lasted a while. It was rather perrrty. Then we busted the bottle and went BACK to the 2 strips that didnt work.They both had rather crappy quality fuses so they went out before they reached there target. I took the last one, tied the remainder of the first 2 fuses to it, and lit it for the final f*ckin time. Since I am the fastest in the group, I usually light the fuses and Kibbz would be at the point where we stop running. Vodka would keep guard while i light. This time both of them went over and laid down on the side of this hill about 100yards away. This would be the first time we have ever seen our own work in action. All the other times we just heard them. I lit it, ran to the hill, and watched the lovely ass fireworks go off. They lasted about 45 seconds, a total of around 400 went off. Dogs were barkin and everything. It was really cool to see em all to. After that we went to this point in the trails that looked like the Q from quake. We smoked some cigars, and headed home. Except...when we were a few blocks away from home, we had an incident. We were walking along the sidewalk when a f*cking garage door opened at the house that we were right by! We bolted into that persons yard...and ducked downand tried to be as quite as possible. This adult came out, got his newspaper(it was about 4:30 in the AM) and went back in. I tried to signal Vodka and Kibbz but they didnt see me. We waited...a few minutes later the man got in his car aand started down his driveway. The flood of lights from his car just covered us. He stopped, got out, and yelled ""WHO ARE YOU!"" we got up, said we were just passin throuigh and stuff, and he kept sayin ""GET OUT OF HERE"", ""ILL CALL THE COPS!"" and ""WHO ARE YOU."" We f*ckin hauled assholes and elbows home. This mission was also liquor free as a result of this person named Brooks Brown (phone #) who tried to narc on us. Telling my parents that i had booze and @#%$ in my room. I had to ditch every bottle I had and lie like a f*ckin salesman to my parents. All because Brooks Brown thought i put a little nik in his windshield from a snowball.......BS? yes, Anyway, that was mission 4."‎Eric Harris
‎3 This mission was an attack on the people who shot Vodka's bike, and on some random houses. First, after sneaking out of my house at around 1:55, we lit off 1 strand of 200 thunderbombs and 6 bottle rockets. We had also set a time delayed assortment too. This was made of 10 bottle rockets and a few crackering balls. We aren't really sure if those went off though because by the time they would have, we where a mile away. After the fireworks we went over to this assholes house. His name is brooks brown, phone number is 303-972-0602, address is 8003 S. Vance St. If any of you feel like pranking him. Anyway, we didn't really do much to him. Just put some model puddy on his Merc. Then, we went to another kids house, and started to teepee his big, tall, thick, thorny-ass-tree. We set off the motion detectors about 4 times, and we dodged 1 car. But we didn't get caught! His tree was completely covered and wrapped in ass whiping paper. Even though we only had 4 rolls, we did one helluva good job. After that we moved some rather large rocks onto peoples driveways and tagged RC into a fence. Then, we came home and got drunk while watching Bordello of Blood.‎Eric Harris
‎"2 Our second mission was against this complete and utter fag's house. Everyone in our school hates this immature little weakling. So we decided to ""hit"" his house. On Friday night (2/7/97) at about 12:15AM we arrived at this queer's house. Fully equiped with 3 eggs, 2 roles of toilet paper, the cheap brand, no pretty flowers. (we were disappointed to) superglue, and the proper tools to make his phone box a busy box (for those of you that are stupid, a buy box is where you set their box so that when they try to make a call, they get a busy signal and when someone else calls, they get a busy signal too). We placed 2 eggs in his very large, thick bushes. We just barely cracked them open so they will be producing a rather repulsive and extremely BAD odor for sometime. We placed the last egg on his ""welcome"" mat. It was very neat, I cracked the egg, put the yoke in the center, and the 2 halves on either side of the yoke. Then we teepeed his large pine tree and this...oak? tree. I dont know, Its big though. It wasnt a complete teepee but it was enough to agitate the home owner greatly. We also put the superglue on the front door and on the little red mail box flag. "‎Eric Harris
‎1 The first was when we put an entire assortment of very loud fireworks in a tunel, and lit them of f at about 1:00AM. This mission was part of a rebellion against these assholes that shot one of our bikes one day. They were rather angry that night, and we were very happy. We will be doing another hit on their house sometime in the near future. And that one will be much closer. And louder. After each mission we get drunk. Not with wimpy beer, we only use hard liquor. Aftershock, Irish Cream, Tequila, Vodka, Whiskey, Rum, and sometimes a few shots of EVERCLEAR. We also sometimes make up our own shooters. And sample others (never try a prarie fire, its killer!). In our next few missions, we are planning to hit the dorks house a few more times, along with a few other houses. And also set off some more fireworks at that tunel. We each have a large suply of fireworks...loud ones...and soon I will have my liscense and we can drive around any place we want to. heh heh. Soon I will be putting our directions for mixing drinks that we make up. We will put up any good shooter or other drink that we try. So check this place out often.‎Eric Harris

God damn its the best thing that ever happened to the Earth. Getting rid of all the stupid and weak organisms but its all natural!! YES! I wish the government would just take off every warning label. So then all the dumbasses would either severely hurt themselves or DIE! And boom, no more dumbasses. heh. YOU KNOW WHAT I HATE!!!? — RUDE PEOPLE THAT CUT!!!!! Why the flip cant you wait like every other human on earth does. If you cut, you are the following: Stuck up, self centered, selfish, lazy, impatient, rude, and. ...damn i ran out of adjectives, anyway. Every flippin line i get into i end up having to wait a flaming hour when there WAS only me and 1 other person in the line! Then the asshole lets all his\her so called friends cut in behind em! YOU KNOW WHAT I REALLY HATE!!!? — LIARS!!! OH GAWWWWWD I HATE LIARS. And living in this neighborhood there is thousands of them!!! Why the flip must people lie so damn much! Especially about stupid things ! Like ""Yeah, i just bought 5 cases of M-80's in Oklahoma for about $5. And they are legal there and everything. Yeah my parents buy most of my guns, every once in a while ill use my 4,000 dollar paycheck and buy a shotgun or 2. And my brand new hummer just broke down on the highway when i was going 250mph. Stupid cars."" like that. now. what flaming part if any would a normal human being believe? And thats just one person!! Another BIG example is Brooks Brown(303- 972-0602). Now, according to him, he has a 215 IQ, 5 other homes (2 in alaska, and 3 in Florida), 95mph fast ball(he is only 16), runs a mile in about 5 minutes, has an uncle thats the former head of all the armed forces and has access to Theee Button..., his other uncle is a multi-millionare that lives in downtown detroit, and his neighbors are the chick that sang ""r.e.s.p.e.c.t."" and the lead singer of Aerosmith. And that same uncle owns 30% of the stock of that tylenol company. And his grandparents gives.. GIVES... him about 1000 dollars for each month, and his other Grandpa can blow up every house in America because all the houses have C-4 in the foundations. Again, according to Brook Brown OK, when people lie like that, its not impressive, noone believes it, it sounds just plain stupid, and its a friggin waste of my time. YOU KNOW WHAT 1 HATE!!!? — R rated movies on CABLE! My DOG can do a better damn editing job than those tards!!!

Yeah, right, bullshit, or like this, ""Dude, the air force has tracked santa clause for like, 10 years now, he is real man. its all a cover up."" or ""The air force just made a plane that can bend light man, its completely invisible."" now, this is just some of the shit i’ve heard, it makes me SICK. And they arent even in the frickin military nor do they know anyone that is even if it WAS true and like they would know about it! GAWD!! I HATE those PEOPLE! YOU KNOW WHAT ELSE I HATE!!!? — People who THINK they are martial arts experts! They are all cocky and thinkm that they are all big and bad. saying bullshit like, ""yeah if you snap your fingers right here the sound waves will melt the brain and youll die from your own brain poring out your earn."" or ""if you flick someone right here their arteries will burst and they will drown in their own blood.

‎Just A Day I seem to remember our fishing trips well. They were always preempted, never extemporaneously brought out by my father the night before his intended day of relaxation. How could one look forward to a trip if they did not know about it? Go to bed early, we have to get up at 5! Under normal circumstances, this would bring out a barrage of arguments & pouting, but going fishing was not an everyday thing. This was a good thing, as opposed to getting up for school or some other bullshit. I would wake up to black skies & coffee bean aromas making their way around the house. I never liked coffee, but I loved the smell. I would dine on fancy breakfast cuisine, otherwise known as Cocoa Puffs. My brother would already be up, trying to impress our father by forcing down the coffee he hadn't grown to like yet. I always remember my brother trying to impress everyone, and myself thinking what a waste of time that would be. I would go to the garage & get my fishing tackle together, & throw it in the back of our 74 Ram. By then my brother & father would have all the food & coolers ready, & they would be packing, ready to go. The drives up to the mountains were always peaceful, a certain halcyon hibernating within the tall peaks & the armies of pine trees. It seemed back then that when the world changed, these mountains would never move. They would remain at peace with themselves, and with anyone who would respect them. We arrived at the lake, but I don’t remember what the name of it is. The lake is almost vacant, except for a few repulsive, suburbanite assholes. I never liked those kind of people, they always seemed to ruin the serenity of the lake. I loved the water. I never went swimming, but the water was an escape in itself. Every so often, the waves would form a small pattern, & change current in an odd shape. I would always cast into those spots, thinking that the fish were more attracted to these parts of the water. Time to bait. I never liked salmon eggs, too much gooey crap that gets on your fingers. Instead, I went with a lour, even though this was a lake. I knew I would have to use eggs if I wanted any fish, but that didn't matter at the time. Cast, Reel, etc. countless times, and my mind would wander to wherever it would want to go. Time i seemed to stop when I was fishing. The lake, the mountains, the trees, all the wildlife shit that people seemed to take for granted, was here. Now. It was if their presence was necessary for me to be content. Time to go!. Done. Back to society. No regrets, though. Nature shared the secret serenity with someone who was actually observant enough to notice. Sucks for everyone else.‎Eric Harris
‎"It would be great if god removed all vaccines and warning lables from everything in the world and let natural selection take its course. All the fat ugly retarded crippled dumbass stupid fuckheads in the world would die, and oh fucking well if a few of the good guys die to. Maybe then the human race can actually be proud of itself. World war II is the last time I bet America was proud of its self. We beat the fuck out of the damn zipperheads and the nazis. We came back, from being bombed and loosing major battles to nuke that little piece of shit island and to take over that cool place called Deustchland. I say its cool because I love the German language and ""BRUTE"" stuff. Kein mitleid fir die merheit. Put everyone in doom I and see who can get past atleast level 1. Actually, then put them into MY worlds. Like Thrasher, Whiskey, UAC Labs, und TIER. I would love to see all you fuckheads die. NBK. I love it! sometime in april me and V will get revenge and will kick natural selection up a few notches. Armed with the following, a terroist bag full of noisey crickets, noisey crickets strapped to WD40 cans, pipe bombs with a shit load of shrapnel, fire bombs, chlorine gas bombs, and smoke bombs. Fire arms we arent sure of yet, hopefully V will have his #3 and plenty of ammo for it. thats another thing, ill fuck around with some shotgun shells for more bombs iso. For me, I don't know what weapon ill have. I just want a firearm that can hold lots of bullets and that wont jam on me. So ill need lots of clips to. Ill have those strapped onto my chest. Maybe a bullet proof vest too. We will be in all black. Dusters, black army pants, and we will get custom shirts that say R or V in the background in one big letter and NBK in the front in a smaller font. We will have knifes and blades and backup weaponry all over our bodies, I will have a tattoo right arm. Once we start we will wear balaclavas. First we will go to the house of and in morning before school starts and before anyone is even awake. We go in, we silently kill each inhabitant and then pin down and Then take our sweet time pissing on them, spitting on them, and just torturing hell out of them. Once we are done there we set time bombs to burn the houses down and take any weaponry that we find, who knows we may get lucky. Then get totally prepared and during Alunch we go in and park in our spots. With sunglasses on we start carrying in all of our bags of terrorism and anarchism shit into our table. Being very casual and silent about it. its all for a science/band/english project or something. Then, we sit down, play some pumpup music, light a 50$ stoge, and get ready to start throwing out the first wave of crickets. Then, we light them, and throw them as far as we can, once the first wave starts to go off and the chaos begins, V opens fire and I start lobin the firebombs. Then I open fire and V starts lobin more crickets. Then if we can we go upstairs and go to each classroom we can and pick off fuckers at our will. If we still can we will hijack some awesome car, and drive off to the neighborhood of our choice and start torching houses with molotov cocktails, by that time cops will be all over us and we start to kill them to! we use bombs, fire bombs, and anything we fucking can to kill and damage as much as we fucking can. if it comes to the time when we are trapped with absolutely no way out, we eat crickets along with a ton of chlorine or some other deadly gas. so when we die, so will anyone close to us. if we have figured out the art of time bombs before hand, we will set hundreds of them around houses, roads, bridges, buildings and gas stations, anything that will cause damage and chaos, if you have ever seen the first few clips of violence in INVASION USA youll know what im talkin about, itll be like the LA riots, the Oklahoma bombing, WWII, Vietnam, duke and doom all mixed together, maybe we will even start a little rebelion or revolution to flick things up as much as we can. i want to leave a lasting impression on the world, and god damnit do not blame anyone else besides me and V for this, dont blame my family, they had no due and there is nothing they could have done, they brought me up just fucking fine, dont blame toy stores or any other stores for selling us ammo, bomb materials or anything like that because its not their fault, i dont want no fucking laws on buying fucking PVC pipes, we are kind of a select case here so dont think this will happen again, dont blame the school, dont fucking put cops all over the place just because we went on a killing spree doesnt mean everyone else will and hardly ever do people bring bombs or guns to school anyway, the admin. is doing a fine job as it is, i dont know who wll be left after we kill but damnit dont change any policies just because of us. it would be stupid and if there is any way in this fucked up universe we can come back as ghosts or what the fuck ever we will haunt the life out of anyone who blames anyone besides me and V. if by some wierd as shit luck my and V survive and escape we will move to some island somewhere or maybe mexico, new zelend or some exotic place where americans cant get us. if there isnt such place, then we will hijack a hell of a lot of bombs and crash a plane into NYC with us inside iring away as we go down, just something to cause more devistation."‎Eric Harris
‎"wow im so glad i found u online, here i was just about to mail this to you: Well, i wrote my mom a 2 page note last night and put it on the counter, i told her about our conversations and why i stay up so late and how its my life and i am in control of it and a lot of other stuff that they have been bitching at me about, so we will have to see what they say about that when they get home from work tonight, im happy, i finally got the courage to tell my parents what i really think, i put it on paper so they wouldnt think i was ""talking back"" or haveing a ""bad attitude"" or"‎Eric Harris
‎awesome, ok picture this: (typing) your in a large rectangular room, about 10 feet by 4 feet, it reminds you of the inside of a hull of a boat, there are old computer screens around you on the walls, except something is different about them, they are futuristic looking, but yet hundreds of years old. they are covered with dust and mold and vines, the only light in the room is from a full moonthat seems to dance around in the sky, so the shadows are all creeping around you. now, in the front of the room, and on the ground, are windows, you can see out the windows and you are looking onto a vast sea. large hill of water going uuup and doowwwn constantly, the only sound is the wind and the movement of the water, the room that you are in is moving, like a blimp would, and you are just standing there, staring out into the sea. that is one place i have imagined i would like to be. ‎Eric Harris
‎yeah, but its still nice, no people at all. kind of like, everyone is dead and has been for centuries, ‎Eric Harris
‎.....can only wish.‎Eric Harris
‎eventually i would only want 1 or 2 people.‎Eric Harris
‎it would be tough to decide who though.‎Eric Harris
‎what kind of people would you want with you?‎Eric Harris
‎if everyone was dead except say 4 or 5 of us. would you want to build up a new human race or eventually let us go extinct?‎Eric Harris
‎maybe if we were all sterile, (couldnt reproduce)‎Eric Harris
‎yeah, in our dreams, it would be great if we were that lucky i dont think i would want to bring a child into this world.‎Eric Harris
‎maybe its natures way. yeah. jst the world itself, i dont know. but i think i would want us to go extinct also.‎Eric Harris
‎like ancient civilizations have done, (pyramids, stone hedge, etc) rrrrrrr. i just wish i could actually DO this instead of just DREAM about it all‎Eric Harris
1998-08-31‎Webb Picture an Earth that has been obliterated by nuclear war and alien attacks leaving cities and military forces in ruins with only a lone marine as humanity’s last fighting force. Picture holographic walls, crushing ceilings, oceans of blood and lava, strange ancient artifacts, and horrible sour lemon and rotten meat stenches in the air. Imagine being trapped on an abandoned cold steel base floating in space for eternity, a leathery skinned monster roaming under a strobe light waiting for a fight, and astonishing weaponry designed to your special needs. All these places and ideas have been created and recreated many times by yours truly. It can be hard to be original in our generation, with so many movies, books, published ideas, and songs that can copied. People can combine ideas from several different fields and mix them into a new trend or fashion but, in reality, it is just more of the same. In order to tell of my creative talents, I must first tell my view on “creativity.” My mind is so full of creative, original ideas that sometimes I have trouble keeping them at bay. For the past three years, I have been involved in a computer game called Doom. Even though one might think it is just a game, I believe it is one of the best ways to show my creativity and intelligence. I believe creativity is a term that is relative to the observer. What one person may think is completely incredible and uncanny, another might think is just more of the same. In reality they both can be correct. I think that about a third of what an average high school student says in one day can be found in a movie or a book. While that student may not be plagiarizing on purpose, someone else might think they are. My point is that, for me, it is hard to describe my creative talents and to be sure that they are original and unique at the same time.‎Eric Harris
1998-08-31‎Webb Doom is a first-person “shoot-em-up” style game. So basically, one runs around levels and shoots at monsters with military weaponry. To most people it may be just another silly computer game, but to me it is an outlet for my thoughts and dreams. I have mastered changing anything that is possible to change in that game, such as the speed of weapons, the strength and mass of monsters, the textures and colors used on the floors and walls, and greatest of all, the actual levels that are used. Several times I have dreamed of a place or area one night, and then thought about it for days and days. Then, I would recreate it in Doom using everything from places in outer space with burned-out floor lights and dusty computers to the darkest depths of the infernal regions with minotaurs and demons running at me from every dark and threatening comer. I have also created settings such as eras of ancient abandoned military installations deep in monsterinfested forests with blood stained trees and unidentifiable mangled bodies covered with dead vines and others that portray to futuristic military bases on Mars overrun with zombies that lurk in every comer. These places may seem a bit on the violent side and, I assure you, some of them are. However, many times I have made levels with absolutely no monsters or guns in them. I have created worlds with beautiful, breath taking scenery that looks like something out of a science fiction movie, a fantasy movie, or even some “eldritch” from H. P. Lovecraft. Now, I know that other people are just as creative or more creative than I am, but I believe that I will always be the best at Doom creativity. In this day and age it can be hard to find a skill that can be completely dominated and mastered or a skill that almost no one else has. This is why I choose a simple computer game to express my talents.‎Eric Harris
‎"ok, i am walking through this very deep forest at night time.J am wearing all this military gear like im a marine or something...there are these big flares going off way up high in the air and they are flying through the sky so there are shadows dancing all around, then i come out onto this beach that reminds me of one of those marine life posters with all the dolphins, whales, stars, oceans and everything, i look up into the stars and they are everywhere, like 10 times as many stars as you have ever seen, then i hear this voice saying ""watch out for the f^^pe a swell time!"" and i get launched into space right into the stars."‎Eric Harris
‎same here, i cant belive i remembered all that, sounds kind of fun thought guess F ** is a dream...! just get flashbacks during the day if I dream and that is ail I think about them‎Eric Harris
2006-08-10‎Of all the lives in this world, apparently mine is the only one that’s meaningful. And that’s the truth . . . when you look at people today, you only see empty bodies, all dressed up and dolled up to the max but that is only the shell. Inside, it is empty. We only live to produce ourselves. We downright market ourselves. Every person wants to sell the product “I” as something wonderful, and because one person is dumber than the other, it works great. Whoever doesn’t want to go along with it, stands alone. I say: “Fuck you!” Why do people have such a hard time taking things the way they are, I mean why don’t my parents, my aunt, or whoever else accept my Mohawk? Why do people not accept my ap- pearance? They think to themselves: “Why can’t he run around normally?” But can you tell me what “normal” is? Is there a book or a homepage somewhere that commands you to act normal, including an explanation on what “normal” is? HARDLY LIKELY! SO, STOP WITH YOUR HARDCORE CONSERVATIVE Attitude and finally accept that: “Normal” is I! Everybody defines “normal” differently, everybody defines it for himself or herself! Is it too much to ask to be left alone? Are we condemned today, if we don’t want to know anything about anything, but rather want to live OUR lives? Yes! Because then the fucking cops come and bag you up! Own opinion . . . hasn’t been allowed anymore for a long time. Miserable state! Miserable planet! Miserable life!‎Sebastian Bosse

Let’s only look at the Nazis’ concentration camps . . . that’s the same shit as prisons. Who ended up in the camps? The so-called political enemies. And who ends up in prisons today? The so-called political enemies! You are already their enemy when you park in the wrong parking lot, then they force you to pay money. Shit! I am allowed to park where ever I want! Democracy = government of the people. Shit, can you tell me where people rule? Every 4 years maybe, when we have the choice between shit, shit, and real shit? This fascist country needs riots and street fights, until this miserable government is overthrown! And essentially what did the SS, the SA do back then? They locked up people when they were against the government. And the cops today? They do the same! And then there would still be our beloved school . . . to be compared to the Hitler Youth. You undergo brain washing without noticing it. You are pounded with what is good and what is bad . . . in their eyes. Whoever fights back, ends up in the concentration camp . . . pardon, in the joint!‎Sebastian Bosse
2006-09-26‎ERIC HARRIS Probably the most reasonable boy that a shitty high school can offer . . . pff . . . ERIC HARRIS IS GOD! There is no doubt. It is scary how similar Eric was to me. Sometimes it seems as if I were to live his life again, as if everything would repeat itself. I am not a copy of REB, VoDKa, Steinhäuser, Gill, Kinkel, Weise or anybody else! I am the advancement of REB! I learned from his mistakes, the bombs. I learned from his entire life.

2006-10-18‎It doesn’t matter what you do in your life, everything is fading! RX! Even my attack on GSS is undone someday! I wish I could turn back this frigging time, and start from the beginning with the knowledge I have now. But even if I could, it wouldn’t change anything about the state and the government. I hate this damn country! I want to be free! “Death or freedom” The state of affairs: Today 1 kg of sulfur was bought, to produce gun powder In the following days, a 12 gauge shotgun, and a .45 pistol will be bought. Timed bombs are being built next week! Planned arsenal: .22, .45, 12 gauge shotgun, 15 pipe bombs, 2 or 3 of them are timed bombs, 10 Molotov cocktails, 10 smoke grenades, 1600 ml of pepper spray, 1 liter of formic acid 85%, machete, knives, Toufac CO2 pump gun and enough ammunition for the weapons! Perhaps still ammonium nitrate, I could get tons of this fucking stuff for free, but I don’t have the opportunity to experiment with it. Before any one of you claims that I am Harris’ or anybody else’s copycat, you should think about it for a moment: Is a priest in a small village only the pope’s “copycat”? No! Of course not! He believes in the same thing as the pope, but he doesn’t copy him. He looks at things the same. Like the fucking pope, he is part of a whole. Don’t you dare have any of these spiritual dick-faces open their mouths at my funeral! THERE IS NO FUCKING GOD But how was the world created . . . I always thought that at one time or another, 2 substances, or more, mixed, and then, very slowly, one thing resulted from another. But I have absolutely no idea where the hell these 2 substances were supposed to have come from!‎Sebastian Bosse
2006-11-06‎Right now I’m holding a 12 Gauge Alarm Patrone in my godly hands! It’s filled with circa 90 grain ass kickin’ black powder, which I need for my muzzle loader guns. On November 17, 20 or 21 I will blow up that fucking piece of shit school! This is a war. The whole World against RX! My weapons are: – .22 Single Shot rifle (sawed off ) 12 Gauge muzzle loader Shotgun (sawed off ) .45 muzzle loader Pistol Bootknife Machete Pepperspray Smokegrenades (10) Pipebombs (8) In the following days I will build more pipebombs, molotov cocktails and self made smoke grenades!‎Sebastian Bosse
2006-11-13‎Today I passed the point of no return. I shot my muzzle-loaders the first time and fuck — THAT SHIT WORKS! This sawed off Shotgun kicks ass man . . . Also I got 10 more .22 bullets, which makes a total of 48 .22’s. 20.11.2006 will be my big ass ENDING!‎Sebastian Bosse
2006-11-16‎I just gave S!lent my G3SAS with all its stuff. He probably think I’m an Idiot because all that stuff costs new more than 400Euro! But hey . . . I don’t need my Baby anymore! I did my biggest AS Games with my G3! It’s better to give it to a TASTE Member than sell it to any Idiot!‎Sebastian Bosse
2006-11-17‎In 3 days it’s all over. People will be lying dead on school grounds, the school will be burning and my brain will be blown out! I just went to GSS to see if everybody will be there when this shit starts. And YES! They will! I’m not fucking psycho! It’s not Airsoft or music that make me killing people, it’s you! Airsoft helped my to hit what I’m aiming! Music helped me when I was fuckin’ down! All I want now is killing, hurting and scaring as much people as possible! Sometimes I write shit in english, because I want everybody to understand what the hell I’m talking about!‎Sebastian Bosse
2006-11-19‎This is the last evening I will ever see. I should be happy about all this, but somehow I’m not. It’s my family . . . They are all good people, and I will hurt them tomorrow. It’s sad, to know I won’t see them again after tomorrow morning. To those I love: I’m very sorry about all this. I never had a girlfriend, I never kissed a girl . . . but wait, there was this wannabe Gothic chick . . . don’t like these . . . but I was drunk, so fuck that. I’m not gay! I don’t think its a problem if anyone is lesbian or gay, but I’m not. I like Jill, from Resident Evil Apocalypse and 3 Nemesis! That’s why I call my sawed off .22 “Jill”. The 12 Gauge is the “BFG” and the .45 is “Mister Pästerich,” named after Homer Simpsons Gun. I like the Simpsons. I don’t like Comics at all, but I love the Simpsons and my own comics. Don’t believe shit people will tell after November 20th. For example that Henning Schumann dude . . . That guy is so stupid it’s not even funny. I thought I was a friend of him a long time ago, but he’s a fucking liar. He hadn’t got real friends because he is just beating everybody . . . god what a fucking retarded ASSHOLE! If anybody of my whole big family is a good human, please help my parents, my grandma, my sister and my brother. I love them! And I hate me for hurting them. They are nice and good people! I hope that other outcasts will be treated better after GSS! And I hope that some of ’em will be like Reb, Vod and Me: A FUCKING HERO! It’s kinda weird . . . I’ve been planning/knowing this for a long time, and now it feels like DAAAMN That came quick!‎Sebastian Bosse

1966-07-31‎I don’t quite understand what it is that compels me to type this letter. Perhaps it is to leave some vague reason for the actions I have recently performed. I don’t really understand myself these days. I am supposed to be an average reasonable and intelligent young man. However, lately (I can’t recall when it started) I have been a victim of many unusual and irrational thoughts. These thoughts constantly recur, and it requires tremendous mental effort to concentrate on useful and progressive tasks. In March when my parents made a physical break I noticed a great deal of stress. I consulted a Dr. Cochrum at the University Health Center and asked him to recommend someone that I could consult with about some psychiatric disorders I felt I had. I talked with a Doctor once for about two hours and tried to convey to him my fears that I felt come overwhelming violent impulses. After one season I never saw the Doctor again, and since then I have been fighting my mental turmoil alone, and seemingly to no avail. After my death I wish that an autopsy would be performed on me to see if there is any visible physical disorder. I have had some tremendous headaches in the past and have consumed two large bottles of Excedrin in the past three months. It was after much thought that I decided to kill my wife, Kathy, tonight after I pick her up from work at the telephone company. I love her dearly, and she has been as fine as wife to me as any man could ever hope to have. I cannot rationally pinpoint any specific reason for doing this. I don’t know whether it is selfishness, or if I don’t want her to have to face the embarrassment my actions would surely cause her. At this time, though, the prominent reason in my mind is that I truly do not consider this world worth living in, and am prepared to die, and I do not want to leave her to suffer alone in it. I intend to kill her as painlessly as possible. Similiar reasons provoked me to take my mother’s life also. I don’t think the poor woman has ever enjoyed life as she is entitled to. She was a simple young woman who married a very possessive and dominating man. All my life as a boy until I ran away from home to join the Marine Corps‎Charles Whitman

‎If I could spend a day as Mrs. Neal, I would be very, very nice to Luke Woodham and pass him for the year. Then I would knock the crud out of the ‘omniscient dork’ for putting junk on my computer. Then I would go crazy and kill all of the other teachers. Then I would slowly and very pain- fully torture all of the principals to death. Then I would withdraw all of my money in the bank and give it to Luke Woodham. Then I would get all of the other teachers and principals’ bank account numbers, withdraw all of the money and give it to Luke Woodham. Then I would do acid. Then I would get a gun and blow my brains out all over the dog-gone room and leave my house to Luke Woodham.‎Luke Woodham
‎I’ve never really done anything that bad, so I’ll make up a story. One day I killed a guy and shot his dog in the butt with a big friggin pellet gun. Then, I went to a phone booth and robbed it by yanking the little coin box out of it. Then I threw water balloons at some nuns, and I went inside their church and set the priest’s wig on fire. (It was the first time I’d heard a good Catholic person say G.D.). Then I burned the church down, then, danced around it and sung 2 Nine Inch Nails songs, one called “heresy” and another called “terrible lie.” Then I robbed a bank and set it on fire. I love to set things on fire, and killed all the tellers. When the police came I killed them all and when the National Guard came, I killed most of them but they finally caught me.‎Luke Woodham
1997-04-01‎. . . I am the hatred in every man’s heart! I am the epitomy of all Evil! I have no mercy for humanity, for they created me, they tortured me until I snapped and became what I am today! My advice to any man who has been tortured by humanity is this: Let these words ring through our our heart, mind, and soul! Hate humanity! Hate humanities! . . . Hate what humanity has made you! Hate what you have become! Most of all, hate the accurssed god of Christianity. Hate him for making humanity Hate him for making you! Hate him for flinging you into a monsterous life you did not ask for nor deserve! Fill your heart, mind, and soul with hatred; until it’s all you know. Until your conscience becomes a firey tomb of hatred for the goodness in you soul. Hate everyone and everything. Hate where you were and are. Hate until you can’t anymore. Then learn, read poetry books, philosophy books, history books, science books, auto biographies and biographies. Become a sponge for knowledge. Study the philosophies of others and condense the parts you like as your own. Make your own rules. Live by your own laws. For now, truly, you should be at peace and your own true self. Live your life in a bold, new way. For you, dear friend, are a superman.‎Luke Woodham
1997-04-14‎On Saturday of last week, I made my first kill. The date was April 12, 1997 about 4:30 p.m. The victim was a loved one. My dear dog Sparkle. Me and an accomplice had been beating the bitch for a while and last Tuesday I took a day off from school just because I didn’t want to go. My friend came over and we beat the dog. In the process of doing so we hurt her leg. Later in the week, about Thursday, I’d say, my brother said she was limping. He suggested we take the dog to the vet, but I talked him out of it saying that she probably stepped on something hard, that she would be O.K. in a day or two. Saturday my brother brings up the vet again but said he didn’t have the time to do it today but he would do it next week. I was afraid the vet would notice all of the bruises on the dog and I would get in trouble. So I called my accomplice and he came over at 2:00. We beat the dog, tied her up in a plastic garbage bag, put that bag in another bag . . . We put the subdued little pooch in an old book bag and went to some woods. When we got out to the woods I took a billy club . . . I . . . handed it to my accomplice. He ran and hit the bagged dog with it. I will never forget the howl she made. it sounded almost human. We laughed and hit her hard. I picked up the book bag, which was now soaked in her blood, and drug her across the ground dropped into the woods. A hole developed in the bag and the dog stuck her head out, fully engulfed in flames. We put more on her, and more and more, and more. She got out and tried to run. I took the night stick and hit her in the shoulder, spine and neck. I’ll never forget the sound of her bones breaking . . . We set her on fire again, the foolish dog opened her mouth & we sprayed fluid down her throat, her whole neck caught on fire, inside & out. Finally, the fire went out and she was making a gurgling noise. I silenced the noise with the club again. I hit her so hard the crusted burnt scar on her shoulder fell of. I hit her so hard I knocked the fur off her neck . . . Then we put her in the burned bag and chunked her in a nearby pond. We watched the bag sink. It was true beauty.‎Luke Woodham
1997-06-03‎This night (June 3, 1997) is a monumentatious night. With this writing, I do swear, that I shall never get myself in a position where I can be hurt by a woman ever again. To myself I swear this, and to the higher powers I swear this.‎Luke Woodham
‎I am not insane! I am angry. This world has shit on me for the final time. I am not spoiled or lazy, for murder is not weak and slow-witted, murder is gutsy and daring. I killed because people like me are mistreated every day. I did this to show society “push us and we will push back!” I suffered all my life. No one ever truly loved me. No one ever truly cared about me. I only loved one thing in my whole life and that was Christina Menefee. But she was torn away from me. I tried to save myself with , but she never cared for me. As it turns out, she made fun of me behind my back while we were together. And all throughout my life I was ridiculed. Always beaten, always hated. Can you, society, truly blame me for what I do? Yes, you will, the ratings wouldn’t be high enough if you didn’t, and it would not make good gossip for all the old ladies. But I shall tell you one thing, I am malicious because I am miserable. The world has beaten me. Wendsday 1, 1997 shall go down in history as the day I fought back.

1997-03-31‎<<–Vodka–>> Life-existence EL THOUGHTZOS Ah yes, this is me writing . . . just writing, nobody technically did anything, just I felt like throwing out my thoughts — this is a weird time, weird life, weird existence. As I sit here (partially drunk with a screwdriver) I think a lot. Think . . . think . . . that’s all my life is, just shitloads of thinking . . . all the time . . . my mind never stops . . . music runs 24/7 (except for sleep), just songs I hear, not necessarily good or bad, & thinking . . . about the asshole in gym class, how he worries me, about driving, & my family, about friends & doings with them, about girls I know (mainly & ) how I know I can never have them, yet I can still dream . . . I do shit to supposedly ‘cleanse’ myself in a spiritual, moral sort of way (deleting the wads on my computer, not getting drunk for periods of time, trying not to ridicule/make fun of people ( ) at school), yet it does nothing to help my life morally. My existence is shit to me — how I feel that I am in eternal suffering, in infinite directions in infinite realities. Yet these realities are fake — artificial, induced by thought, how everything connects, yet its all so far apart. . . . & I sit & think . . . science is the way to find solutions to everything, right? I still think that, yet I see different views of shit now — like the mind — yet if the mind is viewed scientifically . . . hmm I dwell in the past . . . thinking of good & bad memories A lot on the past though . . . I’ve always had a thing for the past — how it reacts to the present & the future — or rather vice versa. I wonder how/when I got so fucked up w my mind, existence, problem — when Dylan Benet Klebold got covered up by this entity containing Dylan’s body . . . as I see the people at school — some good, some bad — I see how different I am (aren’t we all you’ll say) yet I’m on such a greater scale of difference than everyone else (as far as I know, or guess). I see jocks having fun, friends, women, LIVEZ. Or rather shallow existences compared to mine (maybe) like ignorance = bliss. They don’t know beyond this world (how I do in my mind or in reality or in this existence) yet we each are lacking something that the other possesses — I lack the true human nature that Dylan owned & they lack the overdeveloped mind/imagination/knowledge too. I don’t fit in here thinking of suicide gives me hope, that I’ll be in my place wherever I go after this life . . . that I’ll finally not be at war with myself, the world, the universe — my mind, body, everywhere, everything at PEACE in me — my soul (existence). & the routine is still monotonous, go to school, be scared & nervous, hoping that people can accept me . . . that I can accept them . . . the NIN song Piggy is good for thought writing . . . The Lost Highway sounds like a movie about me . . . I’m gonna write later, bye <<–VoDkA–>>‎Dylan Klebold
1997-04-15‎<<–VoDkA–>> poetry my way Da ThoughtZ Jeah Well well, back at it, yes (you say) whoever the fuck ‘you’ is, but yea. My life is still fucked, in case you care . . . maybe, . . . (not?) I have just lost fuckin 45$, & before that I lost my zippo & knife (I did get those back) Why the fuck is he being such an ASSHOLE??? (god I guess, whoever is the being which controls shit). He’s fucking me over big time & it pisses me off. Oooh god I HATE my life, I want to die really bad right now — let’s see what I have that’s good: A nice family, a good house, food, a couple of good friends, & possessions. What’s bad — no girls (friends or girlfriends), no other friends except a few, nobody accepting me even though I want to be accepted, me doing badly & being intimidated in any & all sports, me looking weird & acting shy — BIG problem, me getting bad grades, having no ambition of life, that’s the big shit. Anyway . . . I was Mr. Cutter tonight — I have 11 depressioners on my right hand now, & my favorite contrasting symbol, because it is so true & means so much. The battle between good & bad never ends . . . OK enough bitchin . . . well I’m not done yet. OK go . . . I don’t know why I do wrong with people (mainly women) — it’s like they are set out to hate & ignore me, I never know what to say or do. is soo fuckin lucky he has no idea how I suffer. Okay here’s some poetry. . . . this is a display of one man in search of answers, never finding them, yet in hopelessness understands things . . . Existence. . . . what a strange word. He set out by determination & curiosity, knows no existence, knows nothing relevant to himself. The petty declarations of others & everything on this world, in this world, he knows the answers to. Yet they have no purpose to him. He seeks knowledge of the unthinkable, of the undefineable, of the unknown. He explores the everything. . . using his mind, the most powerful tool known to him. Not a physical barrier blocking the limits of exploration, time thru thought thru dimensions . . . the everything is his realm. Yet, the more he thinks, hoping to find answers to his questions, the more come up. Amazingly, the petty things mean much to him at this time, how he wants to be normal, not this transceiver of the everything. Then occurring to him, the answer. How everything is connected yet separate. By experiencing the petty others actions, reactions, emotions, doings, and thoughts, he gets a mental picture of what, in his mind, is a cycle. Existence is a great hall, life is one of the rooms, death is passing thru the doors, & the everexistent compulsion of everything is the curiosity to keep moving down the hall, thru the doors, exploring rooms, down this never-ending hall. Questions make answers, answers conceive questions, and at long last he is content. TTYL <<–VoDkA–>>‎Dylan Klebold
1997-01-01‎<<–VoDkA–>> 5-2 my thoughtz shit Thoughtz Yo . . . whassup . . . heheheheh . . . know what’s weird? Everyone knows everyone. I swear — like I’m an outcast, & everyone is conspiring against me . . . Check it . . . (this isn’t good, but I need to write, so here. . . . Within the known limits of time . . . within the conceived boundaries of space . . . the aver- age human thinks those are the settings of existence . . . yet the ponderer, the outcast, the believer, helps out the human. “Think not of 2 dimensions,” says the ponderer, “but of 3, as your world is conceived of 3 dimensions, so is mine. While you explore the immediate physical boundaries of your body, you see in your 3 dimensions — L, W, & H, yet I, who is more mentally open to anything, see my 3 dimensions. My realm of thought — Time, Space, & THOUGHT. Thought is the most powerful thing that exists — anything conceivable can be produced, anything & everything is possible, even in your physical world.” After this so called “lecture” the common man feels confused, empty, & unaware. Yet those are the best emotions of a ponderer. The real difference is, a true ponderer will explore these emotions & what caused them. Another . . . a dream. Miles & miles of never ending grass, like a wheat. A farm, sunshine, a happy feeling in the presence, Absolutely nothing wrong, nothing ever is, contrary 180 to normal life. No awareness, just pure bliss, unexplainable bliss, The only challenges are no challenge, & then. . . . BAM!!! realization sets in, the world is the greatest punishment. Life. Hypnosis place — It is a sky — with one large cloud, & sort of a cloud-made chair — the sun is at the head of the chair . . . 10 o’clock up into the sky . . . Below, I sometimes see mist, & the green (forest green) earth — sorta a city, yet I hear nothing. I relax on this chair — actually like a chaise — & I am talking . . . to what? I don’t know — it’s just there, I have the feeling that I know him, even though I consciously don’t . . . & we talk like we are the same person — like he’s my soul. . . . The everlasting contrast. . . . Dark. Light. God. Lucifer. Heaven. Hell. GOOD. BAD. Yes, the ever-lasting contrast. Since existence has known the ‘fight’ between good & evil has continued. Obviously, this fight can never end. Good things turn bad, bad things become good, the ‘people’ on the earth see it as a battle they can win. HA fuckin morons. If people looked at History, they would see what happens. I think, too much, I understand, I am GOD compared to some of those un-existable brainless zombies. Yet, the actions of them interest me, like a kid with a new toy. Another contrast, more of a paradox, actually, like the advanced go for the undevelopeds realm, while some of the morons become everything dwellers — but exceptions to every rule, & this is a BIG exception — most morons never change, they never decide to live in the ‘everything’ frame of mind!

‎me is a god, a god of sadness exiled to this eternal hell the people I helped, abandon me I am denied what I want, To love & to be happy Being made a human Without the possibility of BEING human The cruelest of all punishments To some I am crazy It is so clear, yet so foggy Everything’s connected, separated I am the only interpreter of this Id rather have nothing than be nothing Some say godliness isn’t nothing Humanity is the something I long for I just want something I can never have The story of my existence. — Dylan‎Dylan Klebold
1997-10-14‎Fuck that → Dylan Klebold Me fuck thoughtz Me. sorry I didn’t write, A SHITLOAD in my existence ride. ok . . . hell & back . . . I’ve been to the zombie bliss side. . . . & I hate it as much if not more than the awareness part. I’m back now. . . . a taste of what I thought I want . . . wrong. Possible girlfriends are coming then I’ll give the phony shit up in a second want TRUE love . . . I just want something I can never have. . . . True true I hate everything, why can’t I die . . . not fair. I want pure bliss . . . to be cuddling with , who I think I love deeper than ever . . . I was hollow, thought I was right. Another form of the Downward Spiral . . . deeper & deeper it goes, to cuddle with her, to be one w her, to love, just laying there. I need a girl. This is a weird entry . . . I should feel happy, but shit brought me down. I feel terrible. The Lost Highway apparently repeats . . . itself. I won’t drink. Now, lucky bastard gets a perfect soulmate, who he can admit FUCKIN SUICIDE to & I get rejected for being honest about fuckin hate for jocks. From the wrong people maybe . . . & Anyway . . . here are 2 poems. Fuck me die me‎Dylan Klebold
‎Awareness signs the warrant for suffering. Why is it that the zombies achieve something me wants (overdeveloped me). They can love, why can’t I? The true existor lives in solitude, always aware, always infinite, always looking for, his love. Peace might be the ultimate destination . . . destination unknown. . . . I want happiness . . . abandonment is present for the martyr. My thoughts exist in, want to live in. I want to find a room in the great hall & stay there w my love forever. Sadness seems infinite, & the shell of happiness shines around. Yet the true despair overcomes in this lifetime. How tragic for my dumass shithead I HATE SHIT motherfuckin goddamn piece of death thought and nothin FUCK FUCK FUCK No emotions, not caring, yet another stage in this shit life. Suicide . . . Dylan Klebold‎Dylan Klebold
1997-11-03‎this fuck all Thoughts Farther and farther distant . . . That’s what’s happening . . . me & everything that zombies consider real . . . just images, not life. Soon I will be at peace I hope . . . Burn → “with all your life fucked up around you” I get more depressed with each day . . . more Evil. . . . & I can’t ever stop it!!!  Some god I am. . . . All people I ever might have loved have abandoned me, my parents piss me off & hate me . . . want me to have fuckin ambition!! How can I when I get screwed & destroyed by everything??!!! I have no money, no happiness, no friends . . . Eric will be getting further away soon. . . . I’ll have less than nothing . . . how normal. I wanted to love . . . I wanted to be happy and ambitions and free & nice & good & ignorant. . . . everyone abandoned me . . . I have small stupid pleasures . . . my so called hobbies & doings . . . those are all that’s left for me . . . clinging onto the smallest rocks . . . many people climbing up a never ending vertical cliff. . . . & found a plateau to exist on. . .they walked up me to get to it. Nobody will help me . . . only exist with me if it suits them. I helped, why can’t they? will get me a gun, I’ll go on my killing spree against anyone I want. More crazy . . . deeper in the spiral, lost highway repeating, dwelling on the beautiful past ( & getting drunk) with me, everyone moves up, I always stayed. Abandonment. This room sucks wanna die everything is as least expected. The meek are trampled on, the assholes prevail, the gods are deceiving, lost in my little insane asylum with the outhouse redneck music playing. . . . wanna die & be free with my love . . . if she even exists. She probably hates me . . . finds a or a jock who treats her like shit. I remember details . . . nothing worth remembering I remember. I don’t know my love: could be , or or , or , or anyone. I don’t know & I’m sick of not knowing!! To be kept in the dark is a punishment!! I have lost my emotions . . . like in Hurt the song. NIN. people eventually find happiness I never will. Does that make me a non-human? YES. The god of sadness. . . . church was so fun . . . the rec thing with.‎Dylan Klebold
1998-01-02‎Beeerr . . . Man I don’t know what’s up lately . . . never do in existence. All this shit with & friends . . . so weird & different from past. . . . yet again, that’s the way in existence. I wonder if I’ll ever have a love . . . my love. got his, I don’t, won’t ever get mine. Here’s all the people I’ve loved, or at least liked (or thought I loved) — all the same meaning is the newest . . . the purest (for now) . . . seems perfect for me . . . I seem perfect for her. I was delusional and thought she waved at me the last day of school. Oh well . . . my emotions are gone. So much past pain at once, my senses are numbed. The beauty of being numb. One of my symbols‎Dylan Klebold
‎Everything No, everything No, everything No, everything No, everything No, everything No, everything the cliff theory . . . everyone trying to get higher & stable‎Dylan Klebold
1998-02-02‎I the everything Existence . . . to understand Well well . . . so much changes . . . (like existence). I understand almost everything now . . . so close to my love — . The runes have shown it, she has shown it, I have felt it. I know the meaning of each life: to be loved by your love, & to be happy with ones self. Only for the gods though (me, , etc.). the zombies & their society band together & try to destroy what is superior (what they don’t understand & are afraid of. Soon. . . . either I’ll commit suicide, or I’ll get with & it will be NBK for us. My happiness. Her happiness. NOTHING else matters. I’ve been caught with most of my crimes — xpl drinking, smoking & the house vandalism, & the pipe bombs. If, by fate’s choice, didn’t love me, I’d slit my wrist & blow up Atlanta strapped to my neck. It’s good, understanding a hard road since my realization, but it gets easier. BUT IT DOESN’T! that’s part of existence. Unpredictable. Existence is pure hell & pure heaven at the same time. I will never stop wondering. The lost highway will never end, the music in my head will never stop . . . total part of existence. The hall will never end. The love will always be there. GOD I LOVE HER!!! It’s so great to love.  Society is tightening its grip on me, & soon I & will snap. We will have our revenge on society, & then be free, to exist in a timeless spaceless place of pure happiness. The purpose of life is to be happy & be with your love who is equally happy. Not much more to say. Goodbye. Almost happiness is slavery — the real people (gods) are slaves to the majority of zombies, but we know & love being superior. I didn’t want to be a jock. I hated the happiness that they have — & I will have something infinitely better. I love her & she loves me. (By the way, some zombies are smarter than others, some manipulate . . . like my parents.) I am GOD, is GOD the zombies will pay for their arrogance, hate, fear, abandoned, & distrust I love you that’s all I think about anymore . . . I know that this humanity is almost over, that we will be free. We have proven to fate that we are the everything of purity & halcyon, & that we deserve, need, love, can’t exist without each other. It’s hard, I think that I might not be enough, my mind sometimes gets stuck on its own things, I think about human things — all I try to do is imagine the happiness between us. That is something we cannot even conceive in this toilet earth. The everything, the halcyon, the happiness is ours, there will be no notes from me. Let the humans suffer without my knowledge of the everything. I am trying not to think about the happiness, somehow thinking that will destroy it if I conceive/relish in it when I’m a human, but I love her. We are soulmates. I love you , You don’t consciously know who I am (please don’t skip to the back: read the note as it was written), & doubtedly unconsciously too. I, who write this, love you beyond infinince. I think about you all the time, how this world would be a better place if you loved me as I do you. I know what you’re thinking: “(some psycho wrote me this harassing letter)” I hoped we could have been together . . . you seem a bit like me. Pensive, quiet, an observer, not wanting what is offered here (school, life, etc.) you almost seem lonely, like me. You probably have a boyfriend though, & might not have given this note another thought. I have thought you my true love for a long time now, but . . . well . . . there was hesitation. You see I can’t tell if you think of anyone as I do you, & if you did who that would be. Fate put me in need of you, yet this earth blocked that with uncertainties. I will go away soon, but I just had to write this to you, the one I truly loved. Please, for my sake, don’t tell anybody about this, as it was only meant for you. Also, please don’t feel any guilt about my soon-to-be “absence” of this world (it is solely my decision: no one else’s) oh . . . the thoughts of us . . . doing everything together, not necessarily anything, just to be together would have been pure heaven. I guess it’s time to tell you who I am. I was in a class with you 1st semester, & was blessed with being with you in a report. I still remember your laugh. Innocent, beautiful, pure. This semester I still see you — rarely. I am entranced during 5th period, as we both have it off. To most people, I appear . . . well . . . almost scary, but that’s who I appear to be as people are afraid of what they don’t understand. I denied who I was for a long time. Until high school. . . . anyway, you have noticed me a few times, I catch every one of these gazes with an open heart. I think you know who I am by now. Unfortunately . . . even if you did like me even the slightest bit, you would hate me if you knew who I was. I am a criminal. I have done things that almost nobody would even think about condoning. The reason that I’m writing you now is that I have been caught for the crimes I committed, & I want to go to a new existence. You know what I mean (suicide). I have nothing to live for, & I wont be able to survive in this world after this legal conviction. However, if it was true that you loved me as I do you . . . I would find a way to survive. Anything to be with you. I would enjoy life knowing that you loved me. 99/100 chances you probably think I’m crazy, & want to stay as far away as possible. If that’s the case, then I’m very sorry for involving an innocent person in my problems, & please don’t think twice. However, if you are who I hoped for in my dreams & realities, then do me a favor: leave a piece of paper in my locker saying anything that comes to you. Well, I guess this is it — goodbye, & I love(d) you. Dylan Klebold‎Dylan Klebold
1998-06-08‎Our halcyon I LOVE !! I love her to infinince. I look back on my awareness journey, see the parts & sections of my understanding . . . it’s almost done, yet it is never done, I love . She is my soulmate, my all the imaginative halcyons & pure existences I have with her (to me) are almost happiness . . . I just wish I could call her. . .something blocks me from calling her, my human side is putting up a wall to prevent me from calling her, like a fear of “its” truth. BS. I will overcome all fears, doubts, & zombie-based thoughts (oxymoron) . . . I will follow our hearts to the halcyon, loving her. I love you‎Dylan Klebold
1998-06-10‎me I think don’t care (?) Forever fate, up & down spiral 1.5 human years . . . so much changed in small time, my friends (at my choice) are deplet- ing & collapsing under each other (Eric & ) like I thought they would, I am ready to be with . The ups & downs of fate are forever, good & bad, equal me. The lost highway, & downward spiral never end. Existence is like infinity times itself. I have passed thru this much of the ever existence, this is almost a checkpoint. The zombies have set their in my mind for the cliff theory I’ve off with & we’ve floated away to the halcyon. The zombies will pay for their being, their nature. I know everything, yet I know nothing. I am a true god. My infinite memories, thoughts, perceivations of purity come a lot more with her, there is pure pure happiness — the purpose of our existence. I hate, love things, hate everything, love me & . I understand that I can never ever be a zombie, even if I wanted to. The nature of my entity. Soon we will live in the halcyons of our minds, the one thing that made me a god. Things are so simple, now that they are infinitely complicated. HAHAHAHA. I understand whatever of everything. I am the god of the everything. Fate is my only master. This is probably my last entry. I love my self close second to my everlasting love. Goodbye. I will never stop learning Dylan Klebold‎Dylan Klebold
1999-01-20‎Dylan This Shit This shit again. Back at writing, doing just like a fucking zombie. Lately I can’t change my mind from the fucking deeds of zombies. Earth, humanity, HERE. That’s mostly what I think about. I hate it. I want to be free . . . free . . . I thought it would have been time by now. The pain multiplies infinitely never stops Yet I’m here, STILL alone, still in pain, so is she. The thing I have concluded is that fate will decide when we should be together. decided when our existence started, it should end the same way, with us unknowing, in limbo. I love you . Always have, will. The scenarios, images, pieces of happiness still come. they always will. I love her she loves me. I know she is tired of suffering as I am. It is time. It is time. I love her the journey, the endless journey started, it has to end. We need to be happy to exist truly. I see her in perfection, the halcyons. I await endless purity. I exist as less than nothing without her. –O. my humanity, –O. I don’t know if I should call her, or wait for to act. Yet, calling her is a state of humanity. I’m forever sorry, infinitely, about the pornos. My humanity has a foot fetish & bondage extreme liking. I try to thwart it sometimes to no effect. Yet the masturbation has stopped. I’m sorry . Always I feel the happiness here, thinking of her for brief moments. That’s how I know the everything is true. I hate this non-thinking stasis. I’m stuck in humanity. Maybe going “NBK” (gawd) with Eric is the way to break free. I hate this. The weather is a replication of our thoughts. The happiness is possible, imminent, I on . The happiness is close visible ending, end of the beginning of the halcyons. The humanity is blocking me again. Time to go. HAHAHAHA fuck all. Hate this shit, need to be me, , love her. The framework of society stands above & below me. The hardest thing to destroy, yet the weakest thing that exists. I know that I am different, yet I am afraid to tell the society. The possible abandonment, persecution is not something I want to face, yet it is so primitive to me. I guess being yourself means letting people know about inner thoughts too, not just opinions & fashions I will be free one day, in the land of purity & my happiness, I will have a love, someone who is me in a way. someday . . . possibly thru this life, maybe another, but it will happen . . . Love is more valuable than anything I know. To love is to enter a completion of oneself. I hate those who choose to destroy a love, who take it for granted. love is greater than life even. As I look for love, I feel I can’t find it. Ever. But something tells me I will, someday. Somewhere. As my love will find me, she feels as I do right now, I can feel it, we will be inseparable. Her & I. Whether it is or not, I think I’ll find it (my love). We will be free, to explore the vast wonders of the stars. To cascade down everlong waterfalls, & thru the warmest seas of pure happiness . . . no limits . . . no limits. Nothing will stop us.‎Dylan Klebold
‎The humanity of here & now clouds all that I see. Yet the me, the one, can now control the pain, & it is done. 5 more days. 5 . . . . . . a very influential number, another brick in my journeyed wall. Humans are zombies, they scratch for acceptance & greed & kill themselves thru each other. They will never learn, or maybe they will, but wont have the strength to learn to be aware is not a trait, it’s a godlike thing. Blessed God, not a Christian, Jesus, Mt. Sinai, Abraham, David, Bible gay shit god, but a true controller of existence. was to make us this way. These moments will be lost in the depressions & caverns of the human books forever, like, tears, in, rain, but the thoughts will be eternal. To explain the happiness is impossible even for fate. It’s just a pure halcyon set to last more existences than a conceivable number. Stupid gay nigger humans think I’m “crazy.” Or they think I’m childish. Hahaha, because I can’t solve. That makes me dumb! Because I can’t stay thinking in a 2nd dimension, I go to the 5th! Haha. So I wait 5 more days. 5 more days. 5 eternities, & I know her & I are all conceived from ourselves & each other, every night of the self-awareness journey, every thought we conceived, we have finished the race. Time to die. Everything we knew we were able to understand it, to perceive it, into what we should. Everything we knew, we know & use. An understanding of the everything. An Einstein stuck in an ant’s body. We are the nature of existence. The zombies were a test, to see if our love was genuine. We are in wait of our reward, each other. The zombies will never cause us pain anymore. The humanity was a test. I love you, love. Time to die, time to be free, time to love.‎Dylan Klebold
‎1. One day, one is the beginning, the end. Hahaha. Reversed, yet true. About 26.5 hours from now the judgment will begin. Difficult, but not impossible, necessary, nerve-wracking & fun. What fun is life without a little death? It’s interesting, when I’m in my human form, knowing I’m going to die. Everything has a touch of triviality to it. Like how none of this calculus shit matters. The way it shouldn’t. the truth. In 26.4 hours, I’ll be dead, & in happiness. The little zombie human fags will know their errors, & be forever suffering and mournful. HAHAHAH, of course I will miss things. Not really.‎Dylan Klebold

I’ve found that, over the years, we can’t beat each other: its equal as a nigger to a spade. Waterworld, EVERY year we get . . . of course, all the amp, shit we’ve seen, strobe! (NIPPLE-FU!) We need to find Cavegirl Island & Enemy Gold for home entertainment. Beatin the shit out a boxes, Blackjack, smoking behind BJ, fines, both kickass 4ths of July, it was FUCKIN BADASS!!! SUPA NIGGA!!‎Dylan Klebold

2011-12-28‎I would kill Tidus and the methods of doing this may offend many of you. I would start off by crusifying him and leaving him without food for a total of three days, afterwards I would force him to eat rats. I would apply 1,000 small cuts throughout his body and dip him in a tub of Hydrogen Peroxide. Afterwards, I would recut the wounds and apply a scorpion's sting to 30 of them over a time period of 2 hours after which I would nurse his health a tad. Next, I would rip his nails out and pour bleach and ammonia on them while making sure he doesn't inhale any. I would shoot him in his knee with a crossbow and since I'm an honorable man I would make this the last of his punishment. A quick sword blow to his chest and a large + incision to his belly would do the trick. I would leave him in pain for the remainder of his very short life to allow him to reflect on his personality.‎William Atchison

2012-01-28‎Hey, I'm eldigato. In short, I am a psychopath dedicated to the art of destruction. In my years of minecraft, I have always aimed to make interesting stories. I have always done my deeds solo and for that reason they never reached the peak I had hoped for. That is why I have registered here today.. In hopes that I can work with people with similar intentions and cause many great calamities. Resume Griefing: I like to take my time in order to cause the most damage, but I have attacked many servers with a hit-and-run style of disruption before and caused massive amounts of damage. I would like to say that my best griefing attack was the Scattered Space incident, although the damage wasn't intense compared to most of my attacks on servers, I stirred up plenty of drama in their community. Cooperation: I would like to think myself as that of a rogue in many situations, but I have shown to be able to work with others. Considering our personalities, I don't think I would have any troubles with group raiding. Admins: I can bullshit my way out of things, but I am a honest man. If I focus, I can have a silver tounge that avoids truthfulness. I hope that this information is enough to provide and I hope in the future I can infest the world one day.‎William Atchison

2012-08-21‎July 26th, 2012 In my dream, I went into a bizarre dimension with blue spots in terrain, Rocky Black and grey terrain, and a cloudy black sky. I didn't see the sky, but out of nowhere, a powerful being appeared to me, and the sky had a thin plate of volcanic, powerful orange (gaseous like) material. The being spoke to me words with power, which I can't really recall. In my next dream, I was awake, in my bed, and there was an alien there. I was being hooked with wires to my brain, sort of feeding me information. It was feeding me dreams within my own dream, kind of like inception. In this dream thing, I was studying the possible amount of dreams. There was a chart, like the audacity ogg vorbis specs one. There was a limit to dreams and personality, according to the info. The info I remember is: Personality: 136,742 Dreams: 144 million or more (relative to your body? Or could it be more?) There was another dream about school. See, last year, I dropped back in after dropping out from absolute f'ing hell. I usually saw this poor bloke while passing to the next class. Probably 14 or 15, but he barely did anything to warrant any bullying, yet he got so much ♥♥♥♥ for everything. I've probably interacted with the kid 3 times; the 1st was seeing some of my friends trying to cheer him up, the 2nd was seeing him get ♥♥♥♥ed with by some jock idiots, in which I pulled a knife on them and intimidated them into leaving, and the 3rd was where he had this delicate science project, so I basically daunted the idiots in the middle of the hallway into getting to class and made sure that this kid's project wasn't ruined by D-bags. In my thoughts, I could just see myself at an earlier age in the kid. So, the dream directed my mind into the social 'chart' of the kid and the students in general, in which I just kind of got a broader social look in people; i.e. being able to 'put myself into other people's shoes'. I worked and thought and came up with a moral that I really need to reach that kid and prevent anything bad from happening, because I don't want someone to have to deal with the mentality that can develop from that. The dream flashed to another dream, which was a type of mind probe in a way. I just felt like I was being read. I was having to face my own flaws in a very disturbing and hostile state of REM. I kind of woke up and still felt the alien type thing (Probably caused from human natural DMT from last sentence) glaring at me. It kind of had that 'snobby' or arrogant type of personality seen from some reports of aliens. While I woke up, that thing kind of faded off probably due to the release of DMT stopping. Just for reference, I haven't done DMT or LSD. I've been clean from any type of drug (Tobacco / Alcohol / weed) for 3 months before that dream.‎William Atchison

2014-01-01‎I think the college system and american society needs a massive change. I don't see the point in dishing out $30k a year just to get into college, only for most people to either drop out or get a useless degree, or something they're not entirely interested in. I don't think everything should be free, but there's one thing that absolutely must be- Education. Primary and Secondary school is free for students, which is excellent because every human deserves the chance and the right to be educated. Yet in college, most the time it's going into a huge room with a hundred other students, taking notes of what the professor says, and then studying your ass off to try to actually pass the class. A lot of times, the teachers aren't even good at teaching in the first place. Yet in Elementary ~ High, you have teachers working their ass off, helping each student at the rise of a hand. So normally school only costs tax payers. You get all the help you need for free, during class. You can fuck up all you want. College, you pay a FUCKLOAD of $$$ for, get shitty teachers, have to do everything yourself, and have a low chance of success. In america, College is Bullshit!‎William Atchison

Nice guys need to learn to ignore what women say. Benevolence, Politeness and selflessness are very admirable traits, but most women have barely evolved. Make a subconscious effort to be a leader; to be dominant. Reward them for good behavior, make them reliant on you. That is the only way to get anywhere with them 95% of the time.

2014-01-01‎Sex between an unmarried man and woman - I think saving yourself (whatever gender you are) until marraige is stupid not because I'm against the idea of loyalty, but because once you get married, the sex stops. Marriage is a scam and 80% of divorces are made by women. I hate the idea of sexual casualization. If you're gonna bone someone make sure it's during a relationship. I think that's a reasonable, non-extremist and level-headed opinion.. Divorce The effects of divorce are extensive and cause a lot of conflict on families. Elliot Rodger dealt with family divorce. Same with adam lanza. And btw 80% of divorces are initiated by women. They don't marry for love, they just marry for alimony and taking all our stuff. HAHAHAHAHAHAHA so much for feminism. Having a baby outside of marriage You should only have a baby if you're married, and only after you've given it plenty of time that you have good faith that it'll work out. Gay or lesbian relations LOL. Look if they're annoying or tumblr feminazis - extremists than I hate those people too but who gives a fuck what LGBT people do? You're just in the closet when all you think about is gay people dude. Medical research using stem cells from human embryos Let's hold back scientific and technological progress! Pornography I love porn to an extent but between mormon idiocy of banning porn and liberal degeneracy like San francisco I think being in the middle of that debate is the only logical thing you can do. Access to porn decreases rape. But at the same time most porn is messed up nowadays. Suicide Suicide is society's fault. We're a corrupt, morally bankrupt and savage society which produces 15,000 gun homicides a year, countless acts of mass murder and like 30~50,000 suicides / yr as well.

Same with right-wing extremism, with them you get Waco, Timothy McVeigh, Anders Breivik and other terrorists.3 With the left you can get commie savages and liberal college educated (see: money wasters) degenerates. The greatest countries in the world are reasonably progressive centrist nations dedicated to peace. America is mostly extremism and idiocy; the liberals are a disgrace to left-wing politics and the republicans to the right wing. Now I'm not calling for women being beaten up, mutilated and forced into wearing those robes that cover all their skin like they do in Papa New Guinea or the middle east. All I want is for them to treat men with respect and to not be hypocritical degenerate money wasting idiots. There are a few real women out there.. Budd Dwyer's wife, the Liberian Monkey Island researcher wife, a few. You know what makes them real women? Intelligence, loyalty, determination. Most american women? Brain-dead, immature, cheating, lazy, fat, mentally damaged. It is obvious to anyone that this country has failed.

2014-01-01‎Women have always had it easy. Us men cannot have any emotion, we have to be into sports and killing, and we have to be strong. Women are only expected to use up our resources and -- in a distant past, take care of the family unit. Modern women, however, don't raise their kids. I know my little brother's best friend lived in a household with a single mother. She was 250+ pounds, made him do all of the chores and cleaning, and ignored the two youngest children. Those kids have spent most of their time playing video games instead of being taught values and morality. They will not have anything to reflect back on when they are older, and it is likely they will grow up weaker physically and mentally than would be. That single mother? She married a jock football player at age 17, only to divorce him 8 years later and stunt the family. 50$ says she probably had some nice guy friends who she neglected or treated like shit. If she married one of the nerds / nice guys, I'd guarantee the entire family would be better off. Women ignore and bully nice guys, and leave them to be rather miserable and rejected for their lifetime. The intellectuals and benevolent people usually never get laid and get bullied well into adulthood. It doesn't really change after high school. Yet retards, gearheads, and douchebags get rewarded for their idiocies. This is evidence enough that women are stupid. Dish in the constant nagging, gold- digging, manipulating, hypersexuality, cheating and so many other aspects of the typical 'liberated' woman, and anyone who doesn't have their head in their ass will agree that civilization has a major moral crisis going on. And yet for what I have just said, I would be shunned by most people, even though it's the reality. P.C. degenerates are destroying society.‎William Atchison
2014-06-09‎I'm against gay marriage because I do not want them to experience the soul crushing pain that follows a long time committed relationship, just for 99% of them to fail. All that hard work and energy, cast away within a short time, a powerful partnership obliterated often by corrupt avarice. If gay people had to suffer the romance us straight people live, then they wouldn't be happy anymore, and I cannot let that happen. They are too precious.‎William Atchison

I got few friends anymore, no social life online or offline outside of some infrequent comments on youtube / steam. My alt channel (made in 2009 as a backup for mrapophis) is barely surviving at 9 subs, less than 200 views. G+ Youtube is difficult for me to get used to! My life has no purpose anymore :( My last resort for socialization - my family, they ignore me now. Douchebags! But, it is halfway through 2014! The time, unfortunately flied.

2014-07-02‎I was 5 when it came out. I was in the UK, where my bro played the hell outta the PSX/ N64 games. He just got in MM and played it, but when he was at school or asleep, I would play on my own save. I didn't finish it much, but I did re-discover it at age 8. It was one of the few games I had left, besides OOT and SM64. I would come home from my crappy school, sit down and watch the colbert report and play some zelda.

2014-07-13‎Stuck in a Rural Redneck town The people who are against abortion are usually people who should've been aborted in the first place. Children are savages, and they're gonna grow up to be douchebaggy parasites anyways. They should be exterminated from an early age. Obviously, not all children; not all people are inherintely evil and parasitic in nature. Anyone who is a benevolent or intelligent person deserves a chance at life. However, who should be the judge for who will live or die? All the nerds are too uptight to ever carry this out, so now we got stuck with the bush presidency and they are the enbodiment of stupidity. This obeezy presidency is just bush 2.0, so I doubt the MASTER's plan of UNITY and PURIFICATION will ever come to fruition. As for euthanasia, life is horrible. Just because the majority of people can get laid and have everything handed to them and live in heaven, doesn't mean 100% of people will. Even in the first world, there's so much injustice. Like people living past age 30 still as virgins with little friends. I'm sure a lot of them are friendly, hell that's why its called a Nice guy. But this is a decadent society that rewards cruelty, manipulation, douchebaggetry, and parasitic idiocy. ALL humans should be entitled to an instant painless death. Jack Kevorkian was a hero! Besides, the world population is at like 7.2 billion now, and only like 1 billion (at most) are benevolent or intelligent.

2014-09-02‎I don't want to be lame or anything but I should probably come out about all this. In this town (flora vista).. #1. I have no education. I dropped out of AHS back in ~10, then was forced to attend again and dropped out again in ~12. I had a 3.5 GPA but the culture there was backwards as hell, as if it was stuck in the 1950s. Nothing but savages and douchebags. I never motivated myself to get a GED, I need the forced classes and structure of school, but couldn't deal with all the methheads, roughnecks and rednecks. #2. I have no job, I tried to apply at a few places, Wendys, General Dollar, and Dairy Queen. All rejected lol And besides, I don't have the strength to deal with those people, I can be a hard worker, but I got real bad social anxiety, hate and fear of all these people. Plus I don't got a phone to keep in touch with the boss if they force me to go in for overtime. I got a nocturnal schedule anyways. No car though, nor a license. #3. I have no friends here. All my friends are digital now, only time in life that I had a social life were the times I didnt live in the four corners. I tried a lot during my childhood in this area. But let me just put it this way- one of my friends and their little brothers and sisters, stealthily stole my Playstation 1 I had since the 90s, along with dozens of games - all which could be worth thousands of dollars nowadays. During high school, the other borrowed my N64 and games over the summer, promising to return them once school started again, and guess what the jackass did? He sold it to a guy in denver for $200. Didn't even give me any of the dough. Then threatened to kick my ass when I defended myself from some hicks. The others talked crap behind my back.. There was a time though around 4/20/12 when I got high with a few people out in the hills. One of the kids lived a few houses down and when I dropped out didn't even stop over to say hello. I may not seem the type, but I've been somewhat outgoing, friendly, a joker. I wasn't that kid who actively avoided people all the time and dressed in all black and listened to goth music. I went in, did my damned work, made straight A's then went home to a crap abusive family and did more work and surfed the net. My point? I tried to socialize in this shit town but to no avail. #4. Major Depression, large amounts of anger and hatred, lots of boredom.. I used to cure it through bong hits and video games but I cant even find those enjoyable anymore. My dad's a fat lazy idiot who watches fox news all day, weighs 350 pounds and throws hissy fits over everything. Never even bothered to help me get my drivers license and I'm not entitled or spoiled or anything, I'd gladly get a job and pay for my own car. My moms a psycho hillbilly drunk from florida who's really mentally ill. She smokes and drinks a lot and smells disgusting, and has no manners whatsoever. The most hillbilly accent you can imagine. My bro is an antisocial douche with no education at 27. He's a user, always manipulating people and draining their resources. He moved back in to this crap house with his wife who bored 2 kids from some other guy, ex-meth, no education either. I got literally 0 contacts and I'm too lazy to get a GED. Look, I'm sorry if I'm rude and hateful or anything, but I don't know what to do. I've lived no life for nearly 19 years, most of which was in the miserable ass sun-belt. Did you know new mexico has the fourth highest suicide rate? I don't know if I'm even gonna get an education. I don't want to sound dumb but going into the wild is another option, but I'm thinking of getting a truck with those roofed installations on the back, then putting a bed in there and driving out of new mexico. the DMV is being whiny and asking for a proof of bank account and proof of rent or something; they're one of the worst DMVs out there and that's saying something, eh? I am the only atheist I know in my town, and I've had knives pulled on me over it. If I do drift, I need a gun, a water purifier, medkit and some MREs. I've been thinking of driving to either the Denver area, San Jose, CA, Oregon, Washington, or Maine. I'd love to become a Canadian resident, but I gotta get a GED, get accepted into a 4 year college before I have any chances. It'd be nearing the 2020s before that. Every day I wake up filled with misery, boredom and hatred. In fact, I spent most of the 2010s only on youtube, barely any forums, or in school where I was pretty miserable. I do get out of the house every day, where I take 2~4 hour walks to shed off some pounds and build stamina. Here's my area. I dont like giving out personal info too much but I just want to prove my point. I live in the heart of the southwest, with no cities for like 200 miles in any direction. This causes an effect where the area I'm in is extremely rural. With the mormon influence of utah, it also makes it really republican, like 80%. Everyone does meth, tobacco like crazy, lots of alcohol etc. AHS had a graduation rate of like 50%. Should I escape this dump or deal with it? How can I become polite and make some friends out there in this world?‎William Atchison
2014-09-02‎Well IRL on my 13th birthday back in belen I had some good friends over, we were playing some XBOX and wii and shit then we were going on about ghosts stories and my friend derek talked about this creepy mask demon that stalked his dreams.. then the eletricity was screwing up and there was a much more eerie presence then I saw this fucking masked demon in the top-corner of the den. After then I always had a fear of corners and saw that mask sometimes but always had dreams about it. I remember one of my nightmares had it trap me through all the video games I played except it would corrupt and distort them. So I was playing OOT and saw that dante ghost suddenly attack me, where all 20 of my hearts quickly drained, at 2 hearts / second and I felt a really cold chill. Woke up and saw a bunch of mist across the room or something. One of the other worlds was like this game called RTB, where it talked to me in the bedroom map, as I asked what the hell it was. Then it described how it was murdered by David Ray Parker.‎William Atchison
2014-09-03‎Inflation has cranked up the difficulty level of the IRL game a lot so you gotta get a job to pay rent while sharing that crap apartment with some other guy and unless you got social skills tag at 35+ youll get stuck with some random scumbag who keeps raiding your fridge and wont do the god damn dishes Culturally sure it's more accepting but as cheesy as the 90s was, I'd prefer it over - Honey Boo Boo, Miley Cyrus, JB, One Direction, all this garbage bubblegum pop music, school shootings every week, a congress with 8% approval, 2 quagmire wars noone wants, etc and kids these days are at an all time low lol. Some of them are politically active and progressive and aren't very judgemental, and you know what, I'm proud of them. But a lot of them are complete savages who are rewarded for their behavior by their parents who used to be the bullies themselves. I'd rather be back in the 90s, back on the beach on the east coast or in Cambridge, England.‎William Atchison
2014-09-04‎Well generation Z (late 90s~10s) births grew up with a developed internet. They were often babied and spent most of their lives with the internet. With millenials they were 'special', somewhat grew up with a primitive internet of the 90s and early 00s, where it wasn't that much about socialization. Everything is all white and high-def, dumbed down; there's not much spirit to anything anymore. Marilyn manson used to be extremely offensive to a lot of people but now nobody cares except some idiot right-wingers from rural areas still stuck in the 1950s. I don't want to be insulting even more, but it's the parent's faults, for they are the ones to raise them. A lot of the parents are immature and careless themselves. You see this all the time where little girls are dressed in miniskirts and slut clothing with neon pink. It is an absolute disgrace. Lots of kids are savages. Remember south park's episode about how gingers had no souls? Well now all the kids will fucking tear red haired people apart for something extremely insignificant. I remember going to the mall with my older bro and overhearing some stupid teenagers talking about that one 'friday' music video - and how they enjoyed it. I'm not saying all Gen-zers are stupid spoiled brats; not all millenials are entitled and think they're better than everyone. And not all GG's are stuck in the past and want to kill all arabs and 'japs'. But a lot of them are like it! We're living in the best time in human history; clean food, vaccines, technology. But yet, people are becoming antisocial douchebags. Why can't we be excellent to eachother and unite as a society? It's not like we're gonna be living like kings forever, we're probably gonna fuck up the planet and cause ww3, or become a emotionless, robotic society void of any spirit, with .1% of people ruling every single aspects of our lives. 1984-esque‎William Atchison

Pour lots of cold water on to rinse off the blood. Get a dentist to repair his teeth without knocking him out -ok that ones too cruel for me. Then crucify for 3 days, but with food and water provided. Then (and the boss has his hands cuffed the whole time so far btw) throw that fat fuck into a lake, fetching him after he drowns and reviving him. Then to finish it all off, impale the fuck on a pole, to slowly die in excruciating pain over the course of a week.‎William Atchison

The Real deaths of 6 animals *a snake biting one of the members and getting chopped in half *tarantula biting a chick and getting killed too *a monkey (2) getting the top of its head chopped off.

2014-09-19‎That reminds me.. Back in middle school back in 2006 or so, I remember having this long discussion with some skater kids about what we'd do if we were old people anyways.

2014-09-19‎Redneck/Roughnecks. They're the stereotypical hillbillies you can find all over america; you either love sports and obsess over them or they'll collectively beat you up. Out here in the heart of the southwest, I deal with a unique type of hillbilly- one that has adapted to the harsh, inhospitable desert. At least the south has forests, ocean, beaches and swamps.. This town is 200 miles away from any city; it's right in the middle of nowhere and culturally, it's still stuck in the 1950s. Gays, Minorities, atheists.. they'd get lynched. In fact they actually lynched a transgender navajo a decade back. The place is pretty much 99% mormon, 80% conservative/republican, everyone does meth or tobacco, they're rednecks to the extreme! It's an oil town as well, no other jobs. They all annoy and anger me to the max; if I didn't drop out of the world, I'dve done some horrible things.‎William Atchison

Then I'll mine for resources and create my own fortification, put 2 mill into stocks carefully, buy a bunch of guns and MRE's and slowly create my own town. Maybe make a cult and become a multi-millionare off that too.‎William Atchison

2014-10-15‎I think Marc Lepine was right all along. You let feminists get out of hand and they'll continue to erode society. The western world is degenerating and rotting, as China continues to multiply it's power. It's about time we take up some arms! If these fucks are gonna dox me, I'm gonna fucking hunt them down like the prey they are. I love my country! I will not stand to allow these america-haters to continue to pollute my empire! Well, if I kill people I'll just go to an american prison and nobody wants that huh? So I'll just post offensive shit on the net instead. In all honestly, I think they need to legalize prostitution. Give these virgins in the gaming industry some escorts instead of ugly fat feminists. The escorts are sexually experienced. The feminists have a good chance to be.. not only inexperienced, but to cut your chode off. They'd also yell at you constantly. I want actual equality and equal responsibilities. Feminists nowadays want to create this nightmarish 1984 authoritarian matriarchal degenesis. I know most of you probably got like brown hair and neckbeards or something. You have no experience with firearms. But it's about time you start training, because when the civil war comes in like 20 years, I want to ensure the feminists don't win. Remember, use hollow points!‎William Atchison
2014-10-18‎Anyone remember when sirtom93 was gonna go burn his school down? See, because the brits banned guns their loons had to resort to knives and gasoline. Within 20 minutes, the police were already informed and tom got captured by the men in white. For 5 years, there hasn't been any word on the bloke. I would think by now he'd be free. Sometimes, kids aren't as incompetent. Look at another NG user: Jeff Weise. Bloke killed nearly a dozen people about a decade back.‎William Atchison

2014-10-24‎Another documentary to archive. I'll definitely check it out! Aight now I'm done with all those posts so let me move back to discussing Jeff Weise. I don't give a fuck about the new stigma of giving attention to killers, as it's going to happen anyways. Let me just say I bet green money Jeff knew if he just killed himself he wouldn't be remembered by more than like a dozen people. All who gave him shit wouldn't care and would laugh at him anyways and think of him as weak. You cannot hope for any decency from a bunch of scumbags who lack any form of empathy anyways. Mass murderers kill for fame. I know its a bit out of place to write a TL;DR piece about jeff on another article, but whatever. If you look at the area where he lived, it's on a native american reservation. I live near the largest one in the US, the navajo nation. There's a huge crime rate there, with extreme homicide/suicide rates, and everyone is dirt poor. It's a fucking 3rd world country in the middle of fucking nowhere (arizona). Now imagine instead of a desert wasteland, a cold, (even more) isolated place far from a city. Imagine all the pain 'regret' went through. His parents dying, having only his grandparents to depend on, in the middle of nowhere back before the internet became super-social. Of course when he went postal it did get 15 minutes of fame, but nobody knows who he is... because he isn't some suburban white boy. There's a bias on other races. Come next march, it will be 10 years since his death! That's an entire decade that's passed. If ghosts exist, that means the bloke had to deal with a decade of extra misery, now possibly tormented by 8 victims. As for the kid who went postal today, he only killed like 3 so it's not sufficient enough to become a household name. Since he's white if he just dished in 6 more souls the circus would be in full swing...‎William Atchison

2014-10-25‎You might not wanna admit it, but those 2 fuckers had style. Most of these events has some pissed off depressed kid go and kill like 2~3 people. Some who are actually competent, like lanza or cho, kill dozens, but leave behind nothing but incoherent ramblings. The columbine weirdos did their act right around the turn of the millenium, in a suburban culture-war area, filled with uptight soccermom cunts, and had carefully manipulated everyone and everything into order. They carried lots of knives, and 99 bombs. If their propane bombs detonated, there'd be 450+ deaths from the blasts alone. They also left behind journals, videos, etc. Plus the police report was like 20,000 pages long. Waco made a dent in the american morale, mcveigh left a bigger one. Columbine ruined school even further, and issued in a huge ass moral panic. A generation later, columbine is still a household name, and nobody remembers that word for the beautiful flower you can find in colorado, but for that event that happened a fuckin decade and'a' half ago. tl;dr all these kids know about it even though they were like toddlers back then, because it's still very famous today. They look up to the killers because they were bullied and got revenge on the system (school) that torments them. Little do these kids know that the killers murdered mostly innocent people; A students. Like I said, go look up Daniel Mauser and Dave Sanders while you're reading this. You owe the victims that attention.‎William Atchison

I', in the NW of NM in farmington and I have no friends and antiscocial NEET‎William Atchison
2014-11-03‎It's really sad that bloke went through all that. Dad committing suicide, mom being highly abusive then getting in a car crash and being permanently disabled I think, living in that native american reservation where like most of the students were suicidal, and it had a low graduation rate. That kid was an outcast in that town, and had a hellish life, even after that shit happened he was still mostly ignored after the media shitstorm faded. I dont believe in glorifying violence but the right thing to do is to have pity and empathy for who that guy was.. but not necessarily what he became. I don't intend to white knight or anything, but I'm very sympathetic to the pain and suffering they all dealt with (and still do) as I came from the same general background in a sense and I have firsthand experience of what hell is like, as I've lived in an isolated area of the US too with a lot of scumbags. On topic, I procrastinated for the longest time to make this account. I could've made it a few years earlier but saw no point at the time. At least I'm participating with the internet for once; my older bro's been using comps since the commodore 64 and he was there to see this site in the 90s but never bothered to sign up. I've been very depressed isolated and sad for the last .. 4 years, really. However I'm trying to combat it by socializing as much as possible with a world I feel disconnected from. My heyday playing wow, runescape, maplestory, RTB 1.045; the original youtube, google vids, all of it. Each day my memories slowly fade away, but I'll continue to keep active in the communities.‎William Atchison

2014-11-04‎Well it may have taken 13 years, but they've finally finished this tower. I've been interested in the progress for a while now, so it's good to see they finished it. The new tower is like 1,776 ft. if I'm correct. It's no Burj Khalifa, but it's a large amount of space. I wish a lot of the rescue workers and the flight 93 heroes could've seen the new tower. Most importantly, I wish bush would've actually paid attention to the intelligence agencies warnings about a potential attack. I also wish gore would've won instead, as he had the popular vote. Fuck jeb bush as well.‎William Atchison
2014-11-05‎The first day of anything you'll be inexperienced, anxious, nervous etc. If anyone had a shitty school life, you'll remember this. The first day you would be scared.. anxious, lost. After a few weeks, you build a slight immunity and resistance, then it becomes routine. Sadly, you don't get summer, winter and spring break off work. In the US we're stereotyped as lazy morons, but we actually work some of the most hours and get some of the fewest days off for sickness / vacation. Working in america sucks ass. At least you're working. My bro quit his first job after a day, then 3 years later in 2008, got a job carrying a sign. He finally started working at a convenience store in 2010 and is assistant manager there now.‎William Atchison

2014-11-12‎Also I've been living off scrap-metal weed for a few years now and haven't done anything all year sadly. Scrap Metal weed is like shit quality probably from the cartels, a good shot at being tampered with, not too pleasant a high, but it's plentiful cheap and powerful. I have severe depression and when I'm high I have a 50/50 shot at nightmares or utopia. I usually just jack off a lot when I get high because normally I feel really scared and haunted, and i feel like my bones are rotting. It's probably just that I live in a redneck shithole filled with jocks, rednecks, methheads and navajos but.. can anyone recommend me some good strains? Something good for making me feel numb, happy, mellow, but creative. I havent gotten into weed culture in a long ass time but if I remember sativa = active powerful and has more negative effect,s indictiva is all melow, slow and peaceful right? I am 30 miles away from colorado, so I'm assuming I should go up there but i got no connections, i have to count on my brother to get everything and he became a fag lately and cut off contact with the family and now hes married to a 500 pound retard fatty with 2 kids whos ex meth damn it i hate this town HELP I have strong homicidal and an-hero tendencies, I'm pissed off and hate everything but when I'm high I'm funny and I like life. What can tame the beast?! Besides tranquilizer‎William Atchison
2014-11-12‎My grandpa was a quiet badass who killed 30 damn gookers, he was one of Puller's runners! Grandpa was pretty collected and reserved, but It's a shame he had to die a decade ago, I never got to know him much.

2014-11-12‎I recommend an old 1970's movie called Man Friday. Also speaking of 70s movies there's another tropical film called cannibal holocaust which is my favorite horror one, but it's probably one of the most evil things you'll see, filled with real death. So I'd suggest only those with a good stomach and a toughness to watch that, but it's worth it if you're a horror fan.‎William Atchison
2014-11-12‎Adam Lanza was also a pedophile and gay. He was obsessed with the pedobear meme and also had a screenplay on his HDD about some 30 year old and a little kid and some weirdo romance about it Also he used to hit on other dudes on that lame ass columbine video game forum. He also played games like DDR, Mario, Pikmin, kingdom hearts, etc. So yeah those games are tedious autistic and annoying as fuck and got shit difficulty curves where its easy as fuck then instant death outta nowhere. Violent video games prevent violence; these games grind your gears and make you go apeshit. most of us throw our controllers at the tv and break it then have to bullshit a story to your parents; mine was that there was a 'lightning strike'. Sandy hook wouldn't have happened if his mom wasnt a retard and had like guns everywhere, even knowing her son was mentally ill. Also school shooters do it cus they cant get laid and they want attention from the world so I suggest you give suicidal people unlimited access to escorts.‎William Atchison
2014-11-13‎"Yeah schools these days are 50/50 between being paradise and absolute hell. Some kids from progressive areas talk about how douchebags jocks and bullies are virtually non existent, and cliques no longer exist. Another kid told me about how nobody ever talked to eachother because they were scared of getting in trouble because of zero tolerance bullshit. Then there were my schools; even though it's 2014 this shitty town is still stuck in the 50s. I dealt with absolute hell, probably at least twice as bad as Columbine. At least there were some kids in the denver area who aren't jock fags. at my lame little school, I was 5'7"" and looked like that guy from half baked. I wasn't into sports, so I got singled out and fucked with all the time. I begun bringing hunting knives to fend off the savages, thankfully I never got caught by the teachers.

I would build a mile high tower of terror, and would become the source of all magic in the world. I would mass murder via a ray of judgement that would strike up to 200 miles away.

We spent the late 90s Working at a shitty overpriced pizza shop REB would narrowly avoid cops. The end of the century, and we had saved up enough cash. Time to kick some ass! Armed with some lethal weapons And fueled with anger, hate and wrath Set up us the bomb. .... .... .... Our plan had silently failed. We reached the point of no return. We left many bodies pale. Nearly an hour had passed. We had massacred a dozen random fuckers. I waited for my friend.. and we were all dead.‎William Atchison

2014-11-29‎I once saw a toilet which had like 10 pounds worth of shit all over the toilet, on the seat, the walls, etc. That was back when I was in 3rd grade and I believe that's the reason why I've always avoided the bathroom throughout school. I would often starve myself of water and food until dinnertime, which was probably the reason why I got few growth spurts and weighed 95 pounds.‎William Atchison
2014-12-01‎Well I'm a NEET from a extremely republican, redneck and rural wasteland called the four corners, with any place with 50k or more being like 200 miles away. I've spend 2012~2013 being entirely alone; even on the internet. I also suffer from poor health, with brittle teeth and bone, and my only family is my nuclear one and they were never much a family anyways. My life is absolute shit compared to most other first worlders.. So, I rediscovered my NG acc and since summer 2014, I've been posting here frequently, with positive results because of it. If I have to be holed up in the garage all the time, why not utilize the internet to reach out to a world I feel isolated from?‎William Atchison

2014-12-02‎Take, for instance, when I lived in a town about 30 miles south of Albuqerque. It had massive crime, serial killers, drug cartels-men, etc. They even fired all of the police force back in 2009. The town was about 80% Hispanic, and most of the whites were old ww2 vets, so growing up there, I was a minority in school. I'm not going to tl;dr post but to sum up, a lot of the students treated me like a second-class citizen. There were about 5 major families which most people belonged to. If you got in a fight with a Chavez, you could guarantee you'd make 200+ enemies, who have access to guns. The police were often incompetent and corrupt, even before the crisis.. The staff in the schools, being part of the big 5, often were extremely corrupt themselves. They also singled me out all the time because I was very unpopular (being non-religious in a 90% catholic town), along with being the computer nerd, when most of the students were in poverty.. For instance, back in 07 one of my best friends, Aaron was this short, akward African American bloke. One of the ghetto scumbags punched him in the nose, causing severe bleeding. It took 6 minutes for staff to get the situation addressed. The douchebag who broke his nose, he only got 3 days suspension, when he should've been sent to jail. Caucasians have our history of racism, and it's still alive in the south lol, but everywhere else it's not much of a problem at all anymore. Plus you got liberals who white knight minorities like crazy. Anyways, hate crime policies serve to protect minorities, but I bet you green money if I got socked by a ghetto thug from Los lunas noone would be defending or standing up for me. TL;DR, every race is capable of racism obviously, and in 'new' mexico, it is especially prevalent.‎William Atchison

2014-12-05‎Yeah, unfortunately many cops follow the Blue Code of Silence. Being a cop would be a tough job, as you have to do a massive amount of paperwork, risk your life often, and have the public's perception and opinion to worry about as well. However, one cannot deny that there is a corruption problem going on. In many ways, they have gotten better, and I suppose the opposite could be argued. It's a bit macabre, but I was reading through the book of one of the fathers of the murdered students at Columbine, and he described how the police sat outside for hours, as students died brutally. Then the cops boasted about how they saved everyone. Cops have gotten better in that aspects, as they developed Immediate Action Rapid Deployment tactics.‎William Atchison

2014-12-08‎One of the fights back in 4th grade where the jock douchebags ganged up on me and fought against me. 5 vs 1, real fair. Or when in 6th grade I got socked out of nowhere by some 15 year old flunkie drugged up douchebag, my entire right face was blood red, yet I didn't feel any pain when I was pissed off and hit back, but over the next week it kinda sucked. Getting socked out of nowhere again in 7th by another shithead, leaving a large purple welt on my cheekbone. Also had knives pulled on me 4 times. I like how I got in trouble too, and faced longer suspension times than any of the douchebags. Maybe because no matter the race, everyone's related to eachother in this shit state so they look out for their family, yet I'm the eternal outsider. Then they wonder why NM schools have a graduation rate of 55%.‎William Atchison

2015-01-01‎All my school years except one were living hell. 2x worse than what Eric and Dylan went through. In 6th grade, the toughest kid in that shitty school punched me out of nowhere after talking shit. It left a huge red mark on half my face, but I didn't realize this and I was pissed off. I hit him back and broke his nose. I spend the remainder of that year (the incident happened in the first 2 weeks) as the cool kid. I had a lot of friends and even got laid back then, and I was only 12. So that's the moral of the story, folks. Violence is the answer.‎William Atchison
2015-01-01‎Homicide is indeed halvened from the crack-cocaine epidemic era. Most violent crimes are down overall, except (most likely) in warzones like Chi-raq or detroit. However, mass shooting & mass murder incidents have sharply risen since Columbine; Any significant massacre (6+ dead) usually triggers extreme shockwaves culturally, and a lot of gun owners buy out as much fucking ammo as possible, causing these hikes in prices. My original post was simply warning any future gun owners to be weary of any tragedies that now occur much more frequently. As if a thick storm was on the edge, that has now engulfed the area. Chances of lightning striking are significantly higher now.‎William Atchison
2015-01-01‎I strongly suggest using .22's for hobbyists / beginners, for obvious reasons. Get a .22 rifle for around $150-200 in america. The ammo is usually cheap, like $0.05-.08 for a standard quality .22 lr cartridge. Since mass murder is common now in america, a lot of people usually buy up as much ammo as they can, leading to shortages and price hikes, so take notice of these events and plan your wallet accordingly. 22 lr isn't very expensive, and is very great for target practice. If you need to defend yourself, it is still quite capable of being fatal, but learn a mozambique drill. If you just want a light-weight / agile / small self defense weapon, save up $500 for a .45 glock or something.. When you're ready to move on from a .22 to bigger game but want to spend only a few hundred, get either a single-shot shotgun chambered in 12/16, or try to get a surplus mosin nagant.‎William Atchison

It's 6:25 PM right now for me as I'm typing this, but I'll likely do the same things I do every day; sit on ass, try to distract myself from the reality of my life via internet, reflect on the past about 8 years ago when I was a happy 12 year old.‎William Atchison

Before then, I was alright and had no problems, it's just moving to the southwest and having to leave my mom behind, bla bla bla. I used to be a troll for a long ass while, and I still give off the uncaring offensive vibe, but one of my british pen-pals feels it's just a defense mech so nobody gets to know the real, broken, sad and miserable me.

2015-01-09‎They settled down burnt through my colorado stash then we watched some lulzy youtube clips, then watched half baked for a bit till they had to head home around 11:30. the reason why i made this topic is because this is shocking to me that I was able to make friends that fast, when I barely spoke more than 2,000 words in the entire year of 2014, and almost tried to off myself in 2013. I used to try to socialize all the time at high school back in 09~12 but you're either a christian conservative jock, or you're the outcast in this area. I'm begging to understand that I could legit not be able to survive this decade because of my declining health, so I'm trying to find ways to enjoy existence and at least try to seek happiness for once. My brother made friends with the few geeky people in the town back when he was 19ish, and they never let him down. I tried that too, but his advice was to never give up, and that you gotta wave through all the shitheads before you find any real friends. I've spent most of my life keeping my life to myself, I barely used blogger at all, and I kept my personal details private from my closest internet allies, who I've been friends with since 2004~2006. I'm sorry if I'm ranting or tl;dr'ing, and I probably should've kept this to myself, but I just wanted to share the fact that I was able to socialize out of nowhere after a generation of abuse from everyone, loneliness, being ignored all the time by my family, etc, and being denied a normal life ya know?‎William Atchison

2015-02-22‎Listen up, antidepressants are still very risky and experimental. I suggest before you get any of them, that you try st johns wart pills. I started taking them in september 2014, and it reduced my depression by 30%+. I also recommend light therapy; where I'm from it's the desert; 300 days of sunlight a year. Even in winter it's much brighter than germany or england, that's for sure. Get at least an hour of being outside or whatever a day. If you have a shit life like me, I recommend playing video games as much as possible to distract yourself. If you arent akward or antisocial as fuck, get a job if you're done with school.

2015-02-24‎This cat was called Piggy, we took him in from the neighbors across the street when we got back from the UK... 2001, sadly right after 9/11 was when we moved back to america, and in texas of all places. I was bout 7 when we got him, so I was still a dumb naive kid, and I used to be a huge dickhead to the cat without even realizing it, yet he still loved us greatly. As he grew older, he became very loyal, wise, collected... Like a fuzzy little guardian. He always followed my brother around and tried to cheer him up when he was going through his depression and anger. After 2006, Piggy started to do the same for me. I was and still am, a very fucking mental person. Southern hillbilly american society destroyed me, same with my shit parents. I always avoided being seen / having pics of me taken. However, now as an adult, I realize I have no evidence of my childhood now. This picture I attached.. it is the only surviving photo we have of Piggy. We had hundreds my mom always took, but she stored it on a computer and unsurprisingly my piece of shit dad 'accidentally' fucking uses her computer instead and gets it infected with a bunch of viruses. My closest ally in this shitty little world... We only have ONE photo of him. It's been 3 1/2 years since he's died now, and I seem to be getting hit HARD by that fact. It's getting close to being half a decade since I had any permanent allies. If you, the reader, have a pet.. Take pictures of them.‎William Atchison

2015-03-01‎"Like you know MrRepzion? He's mentally ill, and I am too. I got moderate levels of depression, which used to be crippling as fuck in 2005~2007, 2011, and 2014. I'm still able to function and act normal, and if I was able to cut down the severity of it more then I dont see whats so bad about me having some wood and metal. They made it so if anyone sees a psychiatrist cant get guns and I say fuck that. Unless someone is a real criminal; i.e. did a violent crime that got them in prison, then they shouldnt have their 2nd ammendment fucked with. I'm actually more lax on guns than most republicans in a lot of ways. I dont want silencers, extended mags, holow points, sawed offs, or any of that to be regulated a lot. Fuck the taxes, stamps, fees, etc. Sawed offs will fuck you up with the recoil, you can't be accurate AT ALL firing full auto, and if you're going to shoot someone they're going to probably be fucked anyways, so why not ease their suffering with an expanding bullet (HP) ? I'm from a military background, I've shot guns a lot before, and understand how dangerous they are, I dont buy into that ""Guns dont kill ppl, ppl kil ppl"" bullshit. Guns are designed to kill, anyone who denies that is retarded to an extreme. But guns are power, and it's who has the most power that matters. If I was able to carry a pistol with me, I'd have the power to protect myself from all the countless thugs in this country, esp. this state."‎William Atchison

2015-03-09‎White collar is bullshit. Those stupid ass office jobs will get outsourced or replaced by robots almost entirely within like 10 years max. Look I HATE jocks and rednecks, but blue collar is better. Fuck college/uni unless you're getting a STEM field; only the genuinely genius should be going to college/uni in america, the way this failing hypercapitalist state is going. I could go on for weeks about how corrupt and worthless most of the education system is for most people, but 90% of us probably had firsthand experience with the typical american school. Tradition will always rule. Hard physical labour is always going to be the core foundation for a civilization. These office jobs were a dream back in 50's america and all that, but now they're mostly shitty jobs. You have the ass licking turbo-liberal degenerates deteriorating society and poisoning culture and now all the jobs have sensitivity training, silencing, little advancement.. I hate my town but all these oil workers are getting 40,000 a year in the first year of their 'career' in the oil fields. most americans on average only make HALF of that. If you waste all that scholarship / middle/rich class parent's dough on a faggy little liberal arts degeree, you deserve to work minimum wage through your 20s. STEM and Strength leads the way. Womens studies & art is only gay. GET CERTIFIED. If you have a high school diploma, you AREN'T fucked. High school dropouts can't get 90% of the jobs. Stay in school and deal with the bullshit, the bullies, degenerates, just toughen up. Don't listen to the liberal agenda of being a pussy. If anyone gives you shit, beat the shit out of them. Social skills is 70% of what will make you succeed. DON'T take the easy way out, for it'll be the hardest in the end. Work your ass off, get a stem field, graduate from university there and make a 6 digit figure. and hell if you don't feel like going that far, get certified in welding, trucking, plumbing or electronics. You'll make anywhere from $30~60,000 a year. WORK for the oil fields if you can. It's scary and extreme work, but you can make 100,000 easily after a few months. Underwater welding / alaska fishing is a massive amount of money that is well worth it. That's my advice‎William Atchison

2015-05-10‎Violent media usually prevents real life violence and I can easily be generic and pull this little chart out to prove it. (check the attached image) http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/video-games/8676954/Doom-creator-John- Carmack-violent-video-games-reduce-real-world-aggression.html Like I said earlier, a newly 13 yr old kid from my town downright killed himself. He had a upper-middle class family (200,000 / yr ) .. which confuses me as to why they would move to this ugly, redneck rundown desert shithole of a town.. Anyways, he fucking kills himself from all the bullshit from the town. I usually take daily walks, ever since 2014 when I stopped being as much as a shut- in. I casually talk to a few people here and there. I remember having a few lengthy conversations with folks, and when it was relevant to the subject being discussed, I probably brought up the story of the kid a few times. You know what they all said about that kid? He was a sinner and deserved it. Those arent my words, they're the words of the redneck shitheads here. They're all mormon psychopaths addicted to tobacco and meth driving shitty pickup trucks from the 70s. You know the movie naoplean dynamtie? Imagine that but with 50x more hostility in the rednecks, and all the scenery replaced by ugly light-tan wasteland covered with weeds everywhere. My point? you cant blame that kid for killing himself. I'm not supporting his decision, because most suicidal people are usually good people at heart. Most victims of suicide ARE NOT REMEMBERED. I've spoken to the parents of this child and inspired them to do what the parents of Ryan Halligan did and perhaps make a memorial site and do public speaking on behalf of the bloke. Now with that being said, the bloke still had great parents and a nice house, but it's not like that would really counter the fact that the people we're surrounded with are thrice as scary as southerners. Weise lived far away from a lot of american civilization in a fucking rez. You all know his life story by now so it should be of no surprise why he was so dark and disturbed. To wrap this tl;dr post up.. The reason why most modern mass murderers exist is because they know for a fact that suicide alone would just leave them forgotten forever. But if they pull the trigger and take out some random people with them, the media will make them the talk of (not only the town) but the nation and perhaps even the world. Red Lake was on-par with columbine, and yet only got 1% as much attention. You know why? Because they were all native americans- minorities. Even still, a lot of people still faintly remember it 10 years later. Imagine if weise never went postal. Maybe a dozen would've known about it enough to turn a glance his way for a moment, maybe his grandpa would care. It's the killer's fault for the tragedy, but society's fault for making the killers. As for anyone thinking violent video games cause real life violence..‎William Atchison
2015-05-12‎Thanks for a decent nonbiased post that actually contributed to the thread bro. Like I usually say, for this specific case (Red Lake) it's hard not to feel incredibly sorry for the bloke. Given his life circumstances, very few would've overcome those challenges and horrible experiences to become a normal person. If I had a decent family, great genetics and didnt live in a desert shithole state, I would've had a future and a positive outlook on life too. Even small changes like a different location around here would've had massive effects on my psyche. When that guy had his dad kill himself, a drunk abusive shithead for a mom (Who became disabled for life due to a car crash) and was forced to move to a indian reservation you cant blame him for being violent and suicidal. Like I said, I live near the largest native rez in the country. Even 20 miles from the border in a small quiet town, there's still lots of corruption, suicidal people (a 13 year old boy killed himself a while ago) and no real jobs. We're mostly white, if that says anything. Even generic american whites are living in 3rd world conditions out here. I'm not going to troll or be evil. Mass murder is inexcusable and absolutely never commendable. American and most western civilization isnt even really civil. You're on your own out here. Few friends will back you up, most people's families are close-minded and horrible, and we're no longer the great country we say we are, we're 2nd-class compared to much of western europe. Unless you're making 250,000$ / yr as a family unit, you are no longer the fabled middle class of the 20th century. Lots of people say they help the depressed /suicidal, but very few seek to help them. Hell, depression isnt constant sadness, at least once you hit adulthood. If weise stayed alive another 5 years before commiting suicide he would've gone absolutely insane. Once you're done with school, life goes from easy mode to insane mode.‎William Atchison

2015-12-08‎"Current Mood:working Current Music:Eminem Since this will be the first entry in this livejournal, I feel it important to include some sort of introduction. My name is.. well, I'd rather not leave my personal details public on the internet. Although it is just about 2016, and LJ's heyday is a decade old, I feel Livejournal efficient enough for my goal of creating a virtual journal. I am undergoing this project in the slight chance that I may perish. I would rather not be completely forgotten; I'd rather leave some digital footprints for my family and friends and any lurkers. I do not suggest that I'm likely to die anytime soon, considering the fact that I am barely in my 20s. This project will allow me to exercise my brand-new keyboard (AULA model on sale for $22, original price was $50,) and my writing capabilities. It will also be nice to look back on this journal when I am an older adult. Since it isn't being written on paper, I will be able to recover the data for as long as this site is up. I won't accidentally spill some juice on the note and render it unreadable, or tear it up and throw it away; you understand the point I make. Now then, an entry.. Today's work I usually keep a schedule on a notepad in real life where I document each day's tasks and chores, so I'll emulate it here; 1. Encyclopedia Dramatica; I worked on a few of my own pages along with a half dozen other ones 2. I continued to archive various documents relating to my research and interests 3. I used my alts to upvote my content (see: whiteknighting) on a specific gaming website 4. I did a moderate amount of exercise 5. I cleaned out my grandfather's WW2 military storage unit and reorganized the materials within 6. I cleaned my room, paying close attention to every square inch of material to clean 7. I successfully stayed up 24 hours to shift myself back to a day-schedule 8. Did a bunch of chores 9. Cleaned up my desktop, deleted bad games / media to clear up space. Notably, I uninstalled GMOD but discovered the addons and downloads were still there. After deleting them, I freed up 28 GB of space 10. I archived some of my media... And most importantly.. 11. I made this livejournal account! Notable Events I've finally been able to get insurance that allows me to be able to afford dental appointments. My dental situation is equivalent to that of a pollack, and I need to get my four wisdom teeth extracted on the 22nd. I hope this doctor doesn't fuck this up and permanently damage my nerves or jaw. What I have to sayNothing much for now. Time is like a river... When you're born it goes slowly yet you don't even comprehend it; when you are finally able to see it when you're a young child, it flows slowly and peacefully. When you're on the verge of adolescence, it begins to pick up pace and it quickly becomes difficult to keep track of the rippling in the water. When you hit an adult age (around 16), you'll find it going at a dozen times the speed that it went by as a child. Eventually, it becomes impossible to keep track of the details. Just how much time has passed? The last time I was truly happy with existence.. 2008; 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015 .. 7 fucking years. My live has been a poor quality existence for the last 7 years. I have little faith my situation is going to get better. The economy will probably never recover from the great recession. The only people who will become president in the 2016 elections are Bernie Sanders, Donald Trump, Hillary, or another Bush. Suffice to say, I have no faith whatsoever in my nation anymore.

I won't revise it, but rather edit in some more details. 0100 - woke up.. rested in more until 0500 and played two and a half hours of trove. 0740 - left home to go to the dentist 0830 - Dentist; Rinsed my mouth out for a minute's time, sat down, got my heart monitored, neck sprayed with germ killing meds, vein area sprayed felt cold as fuck, cleaned area, then before I knew it, I was already injected with the needle. Took a few minutes until I was knocked out. Had a nice dream... Woke up and my 4 wisdom teeth were gone. Got home and I took a rest, keeping my gauze pads in.. Ice pack. Now its 1500 and I'm going to take another rest. Within a week I can be eating good solid food like tacos and my own bacon salad wrap recipes.. Until then I'm stuck with tomato soup, apple sauce, gravy and mashed potatoes. I've fasted for an entire day (Excluding post-op water). Sadly these 4 teeth werent even unhealthy except the bottom 2 being horizontally impacted. I got a pollack's mouth but it isnt destroyed. I got like 5-6 cavities (3 are small) to get filled but considering 2009 was the last time I visited a dentist and I barely brushed (extremely sensitive teeth) I'd say my mouth isnt so bad. I dont do meth lol. maybe a lot of bong hits but hey, I'm a coloradan at heart.‎William Atchison

If I had vegetarian rice / chicken style soup I'd eat nothing but that.. and some naked juice. When my pain killers wear off I'm feeling like shit. Then again, 4 entire teeth removed so I can't particularly be surprised... I'm too awake to sleep and too lazy to play video games. It sucks ass..

I remember 2007~09 like it was yesterday, and yet I'm starting to lose much of my memory of that time period. Let's take a look at how much time has passed; 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015. So 11 entire years have passed that I've lived in this state. More than half of my life has been spent in one of the worst states in the entire country, and the USA is one of the largest nations in the world. When you look at the list of years, 2005 is barely that far apart from 07, and yet 05 and 06 were probably the worst years I've went through. In less than a year now, I'll begin to experience life a decade in the future from my heyday. A decade, in seemingly the blink of an eye. It's crazy. Hell, as I type this, it's already been 4 years since I've left school. Mass Effect 3 is almost 4 years old already! Skyrim is already at that point. Oblivion is going to be 10 YEARS OLD in a few months. Xbox 360's already hit that point. My grandfather died over 10 years ago.. My loyal companion, a fat, muscular golden cat named Piggy has been 6ft under for 4 1/2 years now as well. Crazy.. Now.. looking into the future, I see no hope. The middle class continues to die, more americans go on welfare or poverty, the rich grow in power, suicide and mass murder skyrockets, USA loses it's power, etc. My predictions aren't even hypothetical; they're already happening and have been for decades. Society has also been corrupted and decayed. Nowadays it's not even uncommon for frikin Pre-teens to lose their v-cards. It's disgusting. Most males are backstabbing betas, or alpha assholes. It's rare to find a good friend nowadays. You have a 50% chance of being divorced within like 5 years at this point by an american bride. The courts are 90% in her favor for most shit as well. Look at the military. PC now. You're more likely to commit suicide than to be KIA. You get treated like fucking garbage by the country you stepped up to 'defend'. It's a fucking shithole in america now, but you don't see europeans accepting any american refugees or migrants. Instead these assclowns let in hordes of rapists and murderers. White civilization is cucked and fucked. The world is hence, not even worth living in anymore. Topics - Time; Corruption; Life and Death‎William Atchison
2016-02-02‎Little braids like horns, this flesh born bone leaves sores. Little horn is born, sworn to the blood in all that implies after being on the frontlines of the hidden genocide; Time to turn the tide, take the guize of a genocidal genius. Feels like none of the people can see this. Depletion with depletion, seeking the solution, but there are no easy answers, for this classroom execution. Born on a plane that is not the same as their mind, I am the weak, the sick, the one left behind. God damnit I'm sick of their kind! Pieces of shit don't even know what they are; in their little cliques, laughing and smiling with their friends, passing judgement on everything they see- I know they're laughing at me. I am an angel in disguise, sent to either be nurtured or denied. I am an angel that fide, so as punished with this life. My feathers have not changed, I still blame god for making me this way. That is my nature, the true test was for you to nurture a soul you could see needed structure. For all of your talk of tradition, you never taught acceptance; of the benefits of being receptive. Instead, you took my beauty as a commonality, of a word you didn't hesitate to call me. Reinforcing old war wounds, you made me legion. Here to bring your ruin, and the changing of reason. Trapped in this physical body, I can only see one way to be free. I will change this fucked up world, by making sure everyone knows of me... - Keith Rock‎William Atchison

2016-02-09‎"Current Location:Liberty City Current Mood:depressed depressed Current Music:Soviet Connection Already 40 days into this year, and I doubt it's going to get any better. I've been dealing with a moderate sickness which has caused me to miss a dentist appointment. My front teeth are starting to cause me severe pain when pressure or liquid makes contact which shouldn't even be happening as the dentists did 2 hours of work on them a few weeks ago. I just got 3 cavities left to patch up and my teeth will be alright, but enough about this shit. For the last few weeks, I've been playing the f*** out of Grand Theft Auto IV. It's just about 8 years old now, but I'm still finding new things every time I play. I must confess that despite now owning GTA 5 (due to a friend gifting me it on steam), I've never beat it. Up until I was gifted it, I never even touched the game. Despite the fact that 5 is superior to 4 in most ways, I still find more enjoyment in GTA 4; 280+ hours of it to be precise. Suffice to say, I'm addicted to Liberty City, and all the fucked up freaks and events that take place within this virtual world. Through the near-decade long time I've spent on IV, I mostly frequented the southern half of the eastern borough, and downtown 'manhatten' and the central park. Lately, I've been exploring the smaller obscure islands and finding a lot of shit. I modded some health / armor regen scripts to make the game a hell of a lot less tedius, but practically doubled the damage of the weapons and vastly expanded the range of them; the sawed off shotgun is capable of downing someone over 200m from you (although it is VERY unlikely due to the spread) I've been going on GTA 4's internet and browsing these sites. I've found shit I never read before. GTA 4 is on par with TES 4 on the amount of shit you can still discover. I was reading blogs in game and legit threw up from one of them. It was basically some ugly fat feminist furfag cunt talking about her perverted sexual activity with someone else and dousing each other with dishwasher liquids. I'm just sitting here thinking.. Someone employed at Rockstar North is even more fucked up in the head than I am. My writing shifts more towards patrick bateman / ER shit. This rockstar jackass is just a perverted troll with a way-overactive imagination. Fucker should see a shrink. Well, 2007 is already 8~9 years old. It's scary to me how time just flew by. I always bitch about how my future is bleak, and indeed the entire nation and world's is (unless you're a spoiled fucking cunt, in which case check your privileged for real, asshole) but I know I'm not the only one thinking this shit. Obama's got less than a year left in office now. GTA 5 is already 2 years old man.. fucking hell. Those days as a kid in that ALB Metro house, with the two fireplaces, the large den; the cozy old-school feel.. It's not even close to recent anymore. All this time I've spent as a shut-in / NEET / outcast.. I remember a time before social media and smartphones. Chad and Chloe weren't entirely fucking brainless zombies addicted to their screens. They're still normies though, so they're still absolute scum of the earth who deserve nothing but a few stabs into their jugular vein. What I'm trying to show you is, the world's a different place than it was when I was growing up. We're seeing Global warming finally having some serious effects. We got the USA at the quality of a 3rd world country now, with a middle class minority, severe poverty, accelerating crime and corruption and the greatest security state in the world's history on the horizon. Just for typing in these buzzwords, I'm now on a couple more watchlists, and nobody is going to be reading this shit anyways except you NSA ass clowns. Here's something to rustle your jimmies. If I was to reenact the shit I've been doing in GTA 4, in the real world, I'd probably have a 7-fuckin' star wanted level. I've been going around driving over thousands of NPCs in central park over and over for shits and giggles, acting out an ""anders"" dozens of times, beating the shit out of random fuckers and other shenanigans. Not much else I feel I should type out anyways. It's already TL;DR but perhaps one of the JIDF rats or creepy faggots from my past might be lurking around. In which case.. I hope you enjoy this entry you crazy ass motherfuckers."‎William Atchison
2016-02-10‎Current Mood:drowsy Current Music:clever stuff... Alright, I know its been less than a day since my last entry, but I've been up for like 20 hours. I some (thank god i wasnt payin') and some ; some high quality shit. My adventures while talking to sampson so far have been insightful but nothing special. I jacked off a lot but I didnt really feel that good from it. personal info but whatever. I've been having intense nostalgia for RTB 1.045.. so eventually I felt like loading it up. When I did, guess what? There were actually other people playing! It was none other than my dear friend RanGun. Ran and I go back a decade. Anyways I know it was fate for us to meet up again man, it was fun. We had a long ass talk, catching up. Learned a lot about his personal situation nowadays. He's going to sleep now, I prob will too. Its 6:30 am so I royally fucked up my sleep schedule. Thank insomnia, sickness and way too many hits for this shit. Sturm out.‎William Atchison

2016-04-23‎"It's been around two months since my last entry. As usual, time is fucking flying, societal deterioration accelerating, and the collective IQ of the american collective declining. I will not give exact details, but a mindfuck IRL happened. I quickly JIDF'd a lot of my troll dust, and have been going incognito a lot more. My childhood game was briefly revived for a little bit again; I brought in my longtime friends to play it again, and some kids from the newer version of it checked on the original. In total, probably 10 people went through my server. I directed a few projects; recreations of Venice, a Medieval-oriented map, an underwater city (not worked on), along with other projects. This was a game that was pretty much abandoned (Besides a small group of people) since 2008, revived with some activity after nearly a decade of rot. I feel blessed to have experienced some fresh memories of the game. I'm considering maybe making a blog about the game but I know for a fact nobody would visit it. Hell, I know for the most part I'm talking to myself on this ""blog"" here, but oh well. I'm not trying to talk to myself; I'm trying to document my experiences, and to give some words of wisdom to you. I've been neglecting some of my most important work, so I need to knock some sense in myself. I've done plenty of internet archiving for now, and I've cleaned up one of my more favourite sites, even if some of the mods and admins on it are autistic cunts. But, nowhere online is safe from these kinds of people. It is nearly summer 2016. Time flies fast.. I wont say too much about my personal life as I have plenty of enemies, especially nowadays. Filthy degenerates."‎William Atchison
2016-05-20‎It's been about a month since the last entry, save 3 days. I'm currently cooking up some dinner while I type this but noone gives a damn. A lot has happened in this month, so far... One of my good friends, whom I've barely known for less than a year, yet has risen to be one of my bros, challenged me to a debate. He is of a religion I won't specify (it's not islam, dont worry) but was challenging my lack of faith in any paranormal / spiritual shit. So he told me to do a mental ritual. I did, and I asked for what I want (Success with my endeavors, and meeting girls). I had a 10/10 luck streak that lasted a week. In that time... 5 of the ladies I knew, sent me nudes (each one of them) and got comfortable sexting with me. One young woman I know IRL, will be visiting me after this semester's out, and will be making my life the best it's been since 2008. I became an admin of a very notable site. After thinking about a specific reservation and the tragedy that befell them (early in may, a similar tragedy effected the rez Im from), I found some random Native American dude on omegle. I went on there to troll but instead had a good conversation with this dude. He talked to me about how 6 of his friends chose to end it. He is from the poorest rez in america yet made it to college. Kudos to him. I talked to a very famous dude (hint: 2011, retaliation against some faggy little bully) for 40 minutes. I went on to skype some chick but she went to bed; instead, the famous dude was on for once. He allowed people to add him on skype, so I did; I thought it was an impostor but it was actually him. I brought up the dude I met yesterday, and the famous dude told me how he talked 13 people out of becoming an hero. Good job man. I made one of the girls I know into a sort of girlfriend, the first time I had one since 2009. The luck wore out after a week but I still pray to the specific 'subjects' that I did when I did the meditation-focus experiment. 666‎William Atchison

2017-01-01‎School shooters do it cus they cant get laid Columbine opened the floodgates / pandora's box. The amount of infamy (on par with 9/11) they got inspired literally thousands of alienated youth into mass violence. Most school shooters, and a big chunk of mass shooters, cite them as direct inspiration. violence is the answer if it's self defense being a retard and murdering everything isn't most school shooters never kill the people who actually bullied them. Look at Columbine where they spared the one guy who directly fucked them over. Then 99% of the victims were high-IQ nerdy types in the library Rebel with a rebel yell, raise hell, we gon' let 'em know Stomp, push shove, mush; fuck Bush! Until they bring our troops home, come on, just— SUICIDE PILLS MASS MURDER PILLS they did it for the lulz Protip to all you totalitarian morons. The vast majority (like 86%) of school shooters were bullied, often to an extreme. Bullying, isolation, alienation = lower life span and a fucked up mentality Relatively lax gun laws won't automatically result in massive homicide rates, but it definitely helps more nutjobs get armed. However, look how the gun-free-countries often fare in homicide rates compared to somewhere like Germany, Norway, Finland or Switzerland, where guns are relatively common and purchaseable. It's the people, not the laws, people. Most of school is a fucking nightmare equivalent to prison if you're even an iota unique or individualistic. This creates a false mentality of what the world is (the real world is still shit but nothing compared to school) which causes the already mentally fragile bullied outcasts to become even more alienated and unstable. Mass shooters / school shooters are given (or at one point, were, before it became an every-3-second occurance) massive amounts of fame, fangirls, news coverage, etc- attention they were usually neglected IRL- or rather, the attention they receive is often negative in nature. So what would a tl;dr sensible method of reducing the amount of school shootings be? I got a solution and nobody's gun rights or freedom of expression has to be fucking taken away by you leftist twats or right wing religious nutjobs. 1. Actually do something about bullying. We don't have to turn our schools into 1984-esque nanny/prison states even more than they already are. Teachers should just punish bullying for fucking once instead of doing literally nothing to prevent or punish it. Not that hard, morons. Usually the teachers went out of their way to cover up and protect the bullies when I was in school, often punishing the victims and treating them as they were the cause; gaslighting. Course I grew up in a redneck shithole small town that was stuck in the 50~80s, a stereotypical 80s movie high school. 2. Stop making mass murderers into fucking celebrities. Ghost / blacklist their names. 3. Reform and expand mental healthcare and coverage for as many people as possible. Bring back institutionalization and effective treatment programs for the societal ills to keep them from hurting themselves or others, and to help them become productive societal units. 4. Be excellent to each other. Not that hard, most people are just pinheads. However, it is in human nature to persecute the different sheep of the tribe, either into becoming great leaders or into suicide or violence. It's in human nature to glorify violence and mass killers. Humanity is just as primitive, chaotic and violent as the universe's creation. We'll always be a bunch of crazy ass chimps goin all out. bullied kid + gun access + media giviing mass shooters fame / fangirls = 3.5% chance of being a school shooter address bullying keep guns away from your troubled kid stop making murderers into heroes / antihereos / stop rewarding violence and stupidity‎William Atchison

2017-04-13‎"Adam shot up school mainly because 1. He had a strong obsession with his own childhood which could've stemmed from child abuse considering he went to a catholic school 2. Some guy was talking about child killers on some columbine shooting forum and said ""How could someone kill little kids? That's almost unheard of!"" or some shit. Lanza saw that post and it helped further permegate his idea 3. He wanted to be as evil as possible to scare society, yet didn't care too much about his own infamy hence why he fucked up his hard drive that stored his Cheese Pizza Kantha and her crew were complete exceptional individuals for not only A. trying to plan a fucking mass shooting B. trying to recruit other pizzafaced youngins C. talking about wanting to do that shit for hours on end.

2017-06-28‎"Most of the ""leaders"" of the alt right are directly connected to jews in some way. Richard Spencer posed with jews and attended some synagogues or other congregations of the jews before and is likely a CIA plant as previously suggested here. Alex Jones (who is barely alt-right but the ZOG media will claim he is) legit admits to being a juden: Milo is of course jewish. Andrew Anglin of the Daily Stormer contracted someone (who's cool as fuck) of the jewish ethnicity to help significantly with building elements of his website, which is most likely an unwitting infiltrated fbi honeypot by now like Stormfront is. David Duke seems cool but I wouldn't be surprised if even he is kosher. The alt-light is equivalent to reddit fags compared to dedicated 8ch pol posters, but is still superior to neocons and most conservatives. The real alt-right meme is just a rehash of the concept of Anonymous. Autists trying to claim they own that movement are the reason why it's probably going to come crashing down in a few years; think Op-Chanology 2.0. The Alt-right is way better than (((neocon))) boomer fucks or neoliberal twats though. A significant fuel source for infighting within the alt-right (as seen especially on Daily Stormer and /pol/) is on the issue of women. I'd say on average 15~35% of the communities to be white knights who put pussy on a pedestal. However, one of the major ideas kicking off on DS is the idea of White Sharia; of severely oppressing thots and restricting women's rights. This caused a clear divide in the community with the WKs having to bow to the will of the majority and the thots in the audience making assclowns of themselves before getting sent to the kitchen. Most alt-right communities, although mostly similar, seem to hate other communities guts. /pol/ will talk shit about Daily Stormer, which will talk shit about Stormfront, etc in a continuing cycle. Feds usually try to trick aggressive twats into agreeing to acts or conspiracy of violence, but I think all those clowns should do is to further fuel that divide to fuck the movement up, something most alt-righters are doing to a small extent already. Regarding the issues of the migrant crisis, kikery, feminazism, etc, the Alt-Right will definitely survive for at least half a decade. It's not guaranteed to be the 4th Reich as of now, until another civil war or civilizational collapse occurs. Granted that trolls boosted Trump into office, anything is definitely possible."‎William Atchison
2017-07-30‎all those beta fags had balls enough to at least mass murder people and an hero, its not heroic but it does take some level of guts to actually do that crazy shit upon their actions they got the 15 minutes of fame and became celebrities for a while what do bitches love the most? power / resources. Money / Fame / Muscle / Genetics = higher chances of making panties soak / higher chances of resources / protection = natural female mammal desire these fags in the real world had none of the above traits 90% of the time, but going apeshit gave them the Fame aspect; whenever theres another manufactured sissy ass boy-band a massive tidal wave of thot juice crashes into them within a year. on a much smaller scale the ghosts of the shooters get to feel happy about their ghosts selves knowing that some fucked up jailbait broads fap to them. The ultimate punishment for the sinners is the fact they cant pop that barely legal cherry, leaving them cucked in both worlds, even if creepy cocksucker thots wanna mate with em. Most these fangrils are tumbler users, so nuff said. Theres actually dozens if not a few hundred of fangirls for even ugly ass freaks like the sandy hook shooter, that faggot piece of shit who murdered 20 kids and 7 hoes (or was a lizard reptile cia crisis actor if you're really exceptional).

I freaked out, and so I through him back and tried to open the car door, he threw me into the backseat and started to suck on me very fast I dunno wy I was hard, but I liked it, he started to rip all my clothes off and started to slap me in the face calling me some bitch or something, honestly, at the time, I really enjoyed it but right after I cummed all over his face, I felt really GUILTY and very dirty for he cummed all over my eyes and mouth I felt like an abused whore, could someone help me?

Then the Jews will be hanged indiscriminately, and they will remain hanging until they stink; they will hang there as long as the principles of public hygiene permit. As soon as they have been untied, the next batch will be strung up, and so on down the line, until the last Jew in Munich has been exterminated. Other cities will follow suit, precisely in this fashion, until all Germany has been completely cleansed of Jews.‎William Atchison

No, I am not on drugs . . . ciggerettes, that's all. I am not really depressed just that the fact that I want people, the world, or maybe just Bethel, to know how and cruel the world is or can be.

‎Hey Every body!! I feel rejected, rejected, not so much alone, but rejected. I feel this way because the day-to-day treatment I get usually it's positive but the negative is like a cut, it doesn't go away really fast. I figure by the time you guys are reading this I'll probably have done what I told EVERYONE I was going to do. Just hope 12 gauges don't kick too hard but I do hope the shells hit more than 1 person because I am angry at more than 1 person. One of the Big is Mr. Ron Edwards, he should be there, I was told this will be his Last year, but I know it WILL BE HIS LAST YEAR. The main reason that I did this is because I'm sick and tired of being treated this way everyday . . . By the way every one allways told me “Don't Judge A Book By It's Cover.'' This saying is true because I was told that my teach- ers say that “He's Such A Good Kid.'' But they Say that About everyone. I don't think I'm a good-Hearted person.

April 20th is an obvious choice, for it is the seventh anniversary of the Columbine High School Massacre. However, I want to see the documentaries that they will show on the History Channel. If  is here, I will wait until he leaves. Then, I will commit the act. I will send Anna and e-mail telling her how much I love and care for her. I will tell her that I would pass by her house, and that I named my shotgun or rifle after her and the m-16 rifle in basic training I will also call  and confess to him what I will do. I have to do this. Every since that‎Alvaro Castillo

2006-06-12‎Dear Journal, Well, today I gave Arlene a complete makeover. I turned her into Eric's shotgun I sawed off the barrel and stock of the shotgun with a hacksaw. It took a lot less time than I thought it would. I taped the butt of the shotgun with duct tape. Now I just have to test her. I also took  's bomb apart, and I no know how to make more. I must reserve the motel for Denver today. Arlene looks so beautiful now. I also ordered a pistol belt and three ammunition pouches from the Internet. Everything is falling into place at last! Today, I also saw a program on the History Channel about Charles Whitman the Texas Sniper. He was an ex-marine who killed his wife, mother and a number of other people on August 1, 1966. This year will mark the 40th anniversary. I can compare‎Alvaro Castillo
2006-08-08‎Dear Journal, I will buy black cargo pants and black boots online to complete the uniform that Eric was wearing on April 20, 1999. I am feeling very depressed these days. I drown my sadness and depression with work, cleaning, and movies. Still, it just keeps coming back. I am a TV junkie. I have been addicted to movies and the television ever since I was born. I just became interested in Rated R movies when I was 7 years old, around the same time I was shown pornography. I am having sexual fantasies these days and fantasies of being held hostage by an evil twin brother. I assume that he represents my dark side. I can't even cry! The anti-deppressant I am taking documentariest seem to be working. On August 29 my depression will end permanently. I just want to die. I don't want to live like this anymore. I have endured 10 years‎Alvaro Castillo
2006-08-23‎Dear Journal, In one week, I will finally be dead. I am just putting the finishing touches on my autobiography. It is in my computer, in Microsoft Word, under the name Columbine. I have almost everything ready. I just need more ammo and I need to go to church before I begin. I cannot wait. I wish I could tell my family, but I can't. I miss Anna. Today, she starts her sophomore year at  . I will always think about her. She is so beautiful. I don't deserve her though. I do not deserve anyone. If I was mentally well, maybe I couldve told her my feelings. I do feel sorry for scaring her. I know I am sick. What do you do with sick people like me. They can't change. You have to sacrifice them. Bad things could happen. We have to learn to sacrifice ourselves. I need to sleep now journal. Goodnight‎Alvaro Castillo
2006-08-30‎Dear Journal, Today is the big day for Operation Columbine. It is time that the world be reminded of Columbine. I will die today! I just killed my father. It felt good! He is finally dead.

‎Dear mom and dad I'm sorry about all this is because some of my family and friends hate me but I understand. What I did this shooting is not because of the shooting games, bullying or other stuff, is because of the past causes there were some bad things in the past cause of me. And now I’m just a monster. But I want to say my last words. When I die I will go back to the past and fix everything so it can be the a great past. And the shooting of sparks middle school never should have happend. I wish I can be a smart and a better kid so I can be the better son in our family. But if you hate me and my family doesn’t love me it’s okay I’m know that I’m just an idiot. But I love you and I wish the past would be good and better someday. from Jose H Reyes‎Jose Reyes
‎Dear teachers and students today is the day when I kill you bastards for the embarrassment that you did. You say mean things in school. That I'm gay, that I'm lazy, stupid, idiot. and also say that I pee my pants and also stealing my money. Well that all ends: Today I will get revenge on the students and teachers for ruining my life. Today I will bring a goddamn pistol and rifle to shoot you and see how you like it when someone making fun of you. Once I kill you your life will be nothing but nightmare and bad dreams. I don't care if I have a lot of bullets to shoot all of you, cause I'm gonna die trying on my last stand. And right now this school will now come to an end and your death will be rising when I shoot you. Have a great death at school. Sparks middle school 1965-2013‎Jose Reyes
2013-09-17‎enter project saguntum, a 10 year subconscious project for me to exact revenge, not on the individuals who perpetrated wrong, but instead by those I believe have done me wrong. I will shoot up my school, Arapahoe high school before the year is over. I hope to choose a date with the following criterion. Finals week — everyone is at school, and it will be winter during finals week, I hope I can find a day it is actually snowing, or just incredibly cold. I am a psychopath with a superiority complex. I intend on going as follows: I walk through the asshole in the north side of the trophy hall, waltz in shooting everyone in my way to the (shouldn't be too many, it's not far, I go to the , to kill . From there, there are classrooms in the where I will do something I have wanted to do for a while-mass murder and be in a place of power where I and I alone are judge, jury and executioner.‎Karl Pierson
2013-09-22‎I am filled with hate, I love it. The serotonin supplements I am taking don't do jack shit, I am still ready to start a riot, I feel like a bomb, ready to let the world feel and experience my hatred for all things of pleasure. Nothing makes me happy. When I do commit my atrocities, I want the conversation to be about elementary school teasing. Words hurt, can mold a sociopath, and will lead someone a decade later to kill.‎Karl Pierson
2013-09-30‎I feel like a bomb. My head has happy, anger and confusion hormones. I feel like an aneurism could happen at any second. Besides constantly being pissed off, I doubt the medication is working. I need a real doctor, one who doesn't give medication that has the disclaimer not approved by the FDA. The serotonin is a joke, it makes my bowels upset, doesn't effusively make me happy, and I hate taking them. It is important to note I rarely take my meds for this reason.‎Karl Pierson
2013-10-01‎Saguntum is the project to shoot up (and maybe bomb) Arapahoe High School. No date has been set, but I would like it before new years. Finals week would do nicely, but a date with snow should be sooner. I also imagine the idea of what I hope will happen. I take to school, drop her off, ditch the whole day until (I've thought about it and I like the most). I would also love to burn , so much destruction.‎Karl Pierson
2013-10-03‎Since day 1, my job has been to conspire to shoot up the school. Every semester, I had a class I despised, and it was on the list. Now, I have means to achieve this diabolical end, and I am excited. The date is set for mid-November, I need time to build my arsenal.‎Karl Pierson

2013-11-24‎It's weird going through life knowing that in 19 days, I'm going to be dead. That makes school more boring, work torture and everything I love to do, a little less fun. The hardest part is not being able to tell anyone. I can't just say fuck it, I'm going to shoot up my school soon. I need to make sure that kind of stuff doesn't show up.‎Karl Pierson
2013-11-26‎I can't believe in a fortnight I'll be dead. I went to the library to see if they had NBK. They didn't, but had highly recommended Perks of being a wallflower. I HATED it.

I then went to Brunswick, bowled, got some mountain dew (I bought it for the glass bottles). I'm going to make some Molotov cocktails-shaken, not stirred. Update 45 minutes I built my Molotov cocktails, and I think they look great. I only had oil for three, but I think 3 will be more than enough.

If  you're still in need; of something to read, here's the story of Bonnie  and Clyde.  Now Bonnie and Clyde are the Barrow gang I'm sure you all have  read. how they rob and steal; and those who squeal, are usually  found dying or dead.  There's lots of untruths to these write-ups; they're not as ruthless as  that. their nature is raw; they hate all the law, the stool pidgeons,  spotters and rats.  They call them cold-blooded killers they say they are heartless and  mean. But I say this with pride that I once knew Clyde, when he was  honest and upright and clean.  But the law fooled around; kept taking him down, and locking him up  in a cell. Till he said to me; ""I'll never be free, so I'll meet a few of  them in hell""  The road was so dimly lighted there were no highway signs to  guide. But they made up their minds; if all roads were blind, they  wouldn't give up till they died.  The road gets dimmer and dimmer sometimes you can hardly  see. But it's fight man to man and do all you can, for they know theycan never be free.  From heart-break some people have suffered from weariness some  people have died. But take it all in all; our troubles are small, till we  get like Bonnie and Clyde.  If a policeman is killed in Dallas and they have no clue or guide. If  they can't find a fiend, they just wipe their slate clean and hang it on  Bonnie and Clyde.  There's two crimes committed in America not accredited to the  Barrow mob. They had no hand; in the kidnap demand, nor the  Kansas City Depot job.  A newsboy once said to his buddy; ""I wish old Clyde would get  jumped. In these awfull hard times; we'd make a few dimes, if five or  six cops would get bumped""  The police haven't got the report yet but Clyde called me up  today. He said,""Don't start any fights; we aren't working nights, we're  joining the NRA.""  From Irving to West Dallas viaduct is known as the Great  Divide. Where the women are kin; and the men are men, and they  won't ""stool"" on Bonnie and Clyde.  If they try to act like citizens and rent them a nice little flat. About the  third night; they're invited to fight, by a sub-gun's rat-tat-tat.  They don't think they're too smart or desperate they know that the law  always wins. They've been shot at before; but they do not ignore, that  death is the wages of sin.Some day they'll go down together they'll bury them side by side. To  few it'll be grief, to the law a relief but it's death for Bonnie and Clyde.  Mood: Emptyness Music: Tiamat - Whatever That Hurts"‎Kimveer Gill

I'm still working on it, after it's  all written up, it'll probably be like 200 pages long. Then I'll have to do  major editting, like, take entire scenes out and stuff.  But it's fun. I just don't know how to go about getting someone, like a  movie director or producer to look at it. Cuz' I've never been in this  field of work before. But I don't need to worry about that just yet, cuz' I  don't even know how it's gonna end. Like, I kinda know the final  conclusion. But there's tons of extra stuff I can add or delete from the  last 20 minutes of the movie.  Like in the movie ""SAW 2"". The last 10 minutes or so, makes the  movie great. And just like that, there's tons of movies where the last  bits are spectacular, and only then is the movie a success.

2006-07-13‎Raining blood - There was a  thundering boom and the sky ripped open All went silent No birds  chirping, no dogs barking, no children running around playing, Not a  sound. No cars, no honking horns, no machines. Not a sound  A little blonde haired girl is walking home from school  Then a soft drizzle (no wind) Tap tap tap it said, as the raindrops hit  the pavement Tap tap tap it said, as it hit the roof tops Tap tap tap it  said, as it hit the cars, trucks, and buses Tap tap tap it said. Again  and again and again.  The little girl looks up at the sky, giggles slightly to herself, and starts  to walk faster  The rain quickens it's pace (a strong breeze) Shhhhhhhhhh it said, as  it splashed against the windows Shhhhhhhhhh it said, as it flooded  the streets Shhhhhhhhhh it said, as it drowned the rodents and  insects  Shhhhhhhhhh it said. Just....ShhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhThe little cutie smiles to herself as she starts running. Her greenish- blue eyes glimmer with excitment.  The moderate rain turns to all out thundershowers, a likes of which  has never been seen on this wretched earth. From the skies comes a  laughter, a laugh like no other.  The little girl runs home and opens the front door. She holds the wall  for support as she takes of her shoes. She's so happy.  She runs up  the stairs into her mothers arms A blood curling scream is heard.  Mood: Vengeance Music: Ozzy Osborne - Psycho Man‎Kimveer Gill
2006-07-13‎Death Knight - It rained for three  days The sky is grey.....so grey A deep cut slowly makes it's way  through the palid clouds, and a figure emerges.  Drapped in black cloth. Head to toe, all black Boots as black as  tar Cloak lashing to and fro with the wind The hood covers his face  entirely  The skeletal horse he rides neighs with ferosity as the reigns  are pulled to the side to steer the mighty beast to the left.  His two- handed sword on his back, axe on his left side, sword on the right. A  modified shotgun on a leather sling hangs downwards  The mysterious figure rides down to the earth on what would appear  to be an invisible mountain. As his steads hoofs touch the wet grass,  it lets out an angry growl, almost as though it yearns to be elsewhere.  The disgusting human creatures scream in panic and run in all  directons, taking with them their lies and deceptions. The Death  Knight gazes at the humans with an empty stare, as they knock eachother down in a mad dash to safety. He wishes to slaughter them as  they flee, but sensing that his war horse is hungry and quite weary of  the long journey, he decides to rest.  It starts to rain slightly, as he heads into the nearby forest for  sanctuary. The human noise dimming in his ears as they move  deeper into wilderness.‎Kimveer Gill

2006-08-24‎Raining - It rained a couple days ago, iwent for a walk in the rain, it wasn't raining much when i went, i really  went to get a beer at the Dep, but it was so dark outside, and raining.  I just couldn't rush back home.  I just wish the rain didn't pick up, otherwise it would'a been perfect. I  see people running from the rain, it makes me laugh. You know, how  people quickly rush from their car, or home, or shopping mall, so they  don't get wet. I don't get it!  Or with their umbrellas (I don't use  Umbrellas)  My trenchcoat flew behind me a couple of times when the wind  picked up, other than that not very windy. Just the way I like it. And it  was deserted, every street, it looked like everyone had died. Cuz'  there wasn't a person anywhere. Another reason i liked it. lol. Well,  not no one on one. I did see some people, but like 95% less  population than regular.  Ever notice that when the clouds turn grey the humans become  sparse, like, even before the rain, even if there is no rain. I'll never  understand humans. The way they live their lives, their feelings, the  things they want to do in life, probably has something to do with these  invisible gods they pray to. Meh.

Someone actually told me Snoop Doggy Dog is a poet. Can you  believe that. A poet? You see...you see...people actually believe this.  Animals...just animals. Have you seen some of their videos that play  24/7 on all the music channels worldwide? It's all image. all the girls  are acting like whores, sorry, let me rephrase that...all the girls are  whores. I can't understand what has happened to this world.  They keep refering to each other as niggers or niggahs, they're all  black, yet they keep saying the ""N"" word to each other? Does this  mean that they understand that they are in fact inferior niggahs? They  should stop, and be more gentlemanly and civilized. In one video  some rapped is trying to have sex with a car, while eatting fried  chicken. WTF!!!  Things weren't like this before.

At the dep, at the mall, at the S.A.A.Q., even  though we need more people at the cash registers, they keep  replacing people with machines....machines that suck, and  malfunction.  What's with the construction workers? Why do they get paid so much,  to work so slow? The places i've worked, we have to work super fast  for so little money. Am i in some sort of Bizzaro world, like i'm the  only one in it.  What's with all the bitches? It's almost as though there was some sort  of bitch convention somewhere, and 85% of the women went and all  agreed to be bitches forever. The other 15% were spared. But having  all these bitches in one room gave them a great power. A power not  yet seen in this world. It's a special attack move of theirs. It  transforms them into super bitches. It's so powerful, that they can  only remain in that state for a short period of time, then they go back  to being ordinary bitches.  What's with all the assholes? It's like they invited all the men to a  huge arena, where all the sports were playing, Soccer, baseball,  basketball(for our negro friends), hockey, and others. 85% of the men  showed up. And they must have all made a pact to be assholes, and  fucktards for the rest of their lives. The other 15% who didn't show up  were spared. These creatures were also given a super power of thir  own. They are able to transform into motherfuckers, backstabbers,two-faced liars for short times, thus, just like the women, it's a  powerful ability, so won't last for too long, as it wears of, they turn  back into the ordinary assholes that they were.  What's with people? The governments of the world use scare tactics  to fear the populations of the world into submission, and people  submit. Pathetic little monkeys. Run little monkeys, go kill each other  for your gods that don't even exist, go little monkeys, die for money,  money that goes directly into the pockets of world leaders. Run  monkeys, quickly, no no, don't ever ask questions like ""Why"", ""How"",  ""That doesn't make any sense"", ""That's completly illogical"". Do as we  say little human creatures.

Where's Barbara is the true  question!! - September 04, 2006, 03:57:am   I was thinking of  Barbara Borelli yesterday.  I saw her in a dream. She was just standing their smiling at me. She  looked like a princess. All in white clothes, and she was just smiling,  the most beautiful smile, but didn't say anything, and i just looked at  her, i tryed to look at her ears to see how many piercings she had by  now, but couldn't see anything other than her face. There was a  bright white light shining from all over, around her body, from the  ground up, from the sky down, all over, a super bright white light. I  couldn't stop looking in her eyes, it almost felt like if i stopped gazing  into her eyes, that i would die. For a second i thought she was trying  to tell me something, I wanted to run up to her and hold her, and  touch her, to see if she was real, cuz' this dream felt different than  others i've had. But i couldn't move. I wanted to look down to see if  there was something holding my feet and keeping me from moving,  but i couldn't take my eyes off her.  It was weird. Cuz' usually I have dreams about people beingmurdered, hung, getting shot in the head, and stuff like that.  Sometimes it's me that that stuff is happening to, and it's always dark  and cold. But this was so different.  I wonder what happened to her? She was a girl that went to my high  school. We hardly ever spoke, we were in like two different groups of  friends, so our paths rarely crossed. She always looks so  preoccupied with stuff. I liked her, guess I should have told her or  something, just to let her know and stuff, not that anything would  have happened, but it would'a been nice.  I wonder what she's up to? Maybe she owns her own business or  something (seemed like something she'd like).

Postal 2 Share the Pain  was o.k. but too childish, i want them to make a game so realistic,  that it looks and feels like it's actually happening. Perhaps when they  come out with Postal 4 (If they ever do)  Not just the graphics, but there should be more to do, other than just  shooting people for no reason, there needs to be a plot, and a good  story line. But i doubt Vince Desi cares what i have to say :(  And there should be music, a good soundtrack, with tunes from  Marilyn Manson, Rammstein, Disturbed, and many others, you know  what kinda' bands we like. Mmmmmm, what else, what else? Make it  longer, ummmmmm, you know the kind'a things i want, and also  make a small additional game, just like the first postal game, but with  graphics of today (that'll just be a little fun thingy on the side) All  concentration showld be on the main game, guess it'll have to be for  Postal 4 cuz' the 3rd ones already being made.  Hope no one kills the makers of the Postal game, cuz' those guys  rock. If someone does attack ""Running With Scissors"" or any of you  guys, it'll be those religious fanatics, like those guys that kill abortion  doctors and stuff, so watch out!!  I also heard that the Postal movie was gonna suck, not that i know  anything, but it's better to postpone production and make it really,  really, really, good. Instead of rushing it. It shoul'd be a blockbuster  movie, that everyone on earth wants to watch, or will want to watch  after they here about it from their friends.  You gotta bring Postal into the mainstream. I want more people tosee what I see. By changing the format of the game and movie, you  can do it. Just a little, the basis of Postal dude should stay the same,  just gotta be a better story line. Lets get to know Postal dude's  girlfriend, the places he worked at, the people that pissed him off, all  that stuff, in detail, like a real kick ass game/movie  (Postal dude was sad before he became angry and psychotic, that's  the part we're never seen in the game. He was normal, but the world  made him the way he became, gotta show that in the game and  movie too)  Meh, that's it i guess  :(  Mood: :( Music: Marilyn Manson - In the Shadow of the Valley of  Death"‎Kimveer Gill

‎STATEMENT by Mr. Lu Gang, Ph.D. My this life is surprisingly full of political incidents. When I was in the kindergarten, I was punished by the baby sitter for calling Mr. Lenin, the grand dad of Soviet Communism, “Bold Donkey” which is a popular insulting slung for bold people. In the last year of my junior high I was assigned to visit the memorial tomb of Chairman Mao. I showed some reluctance to the class supervisor because it was right the time for final exams. Then my public duties (vice head of the class, representative for English, Physics) were deprived. I was forced to make a self-criticism speech in from of the whole class, and all my school friends left me in the fear of political suppression. I hate politics, but I will certainly go ahead to use politics if it is my only choice to defend myself. My favorite public place in Iowa City is the “Sports Column” where I have been around for about five years. I made lots of good friends and inevitably some jealous enemies there. They have the prettiest girls in town there, and some of them could never have been forgotten such as . . . and the little blonde cutie who always stays by her side. Of course there are some girls I run into in other places, such as . . . who is the sweetest girl I’ve ever met in this life. My first movie seen in the US is “About Last Night” the evening I passed my comprehensive exams. My favorite movies include “No Way Out,” “Die Hard,” “Indiana Jones,” and Clint Eastwood’s movies where a single cowboy fights against a group of incorporated bad guys who pick on little guys at their will or cover up each other’s ass. I believe in the rights of people to own firearms. Historically, gun-rights make it possible for the spread of civil rights into the south. In those times, groups of civil rights workers from the north were assassinated/ murdered by pro-slaver southerners, meanwhile the local/federal authorities were reluctant to do anything about it. So the civil rights workers have to be heavily armed before they ever dare to enter the south. Even today, privately-owned guns are the only practical way for individuals/minority to protect them against the oppression from the evil organizations/ majority who actually control the government and legal system. Private guns make every person equal, no matter what/who he/she is. They also make it possible for a individual to fight against a conspired/incorporated organization such as Mafia or Dirty University of- ficials. Usually an ordinary individual is too weak, both politically and financially, to oppose a giant organization. Fortunate examples like Dr. Jean Dew winning a federal case against the University of Iowa for sexual discrimination is really rare. Her success is mainly because she has a solid income (salary for a M.D. could not be bad at all) to support her five year court battle against the university of Iowa which simply neglected her complaint in the first place and issued only a public apology to her after the court’s ruling in her favor. The University of Iowa even paid the fine of the primary criminal in the case (a fellow male anatomy profes- sor), which is really outrageous. This actually indicates that this university is encouraging the male anatomy professor for his illegal behavior. It is believed that there exists no justice for little people in this world, extraordinary action has to be taken to preserve this world as a better place to live. Christoph K. Goertz . . . He told me one day “you are in charge of the code and no one else knows the code” . . . since we are the only group to own the 2-D code right now. But as a honest human being and based upon the findings in the execution of the code, I arrived at some conclusions different from his original expectation. As a result, he became so mad that he refused to let me graduate in time for a precious job opportunity and is withholding my thesis result from being published in JGR where he serves as the chief-editor. When he couldn’t find any more excuses to prevent me from graduation, he failed intentionally to notify me as it should be that I am supposed by tradition to give a 10-15 minutes talk on my thesis defense before the committee members ask me questions. In fact he told me of it until one minute before my defense started. I was taken by surprise and I had to make up a talk instantly and presented it on blackboard instead of on transparency projector. As the result, my thesis was not passed by the committee after my defense and I was exposed brutally to both personal humiliation and emotional anguish . . . Goertz . . . blamed me personally for the failure of my defense . . . I did not ask him to write letters of recommendation for job opportunities. Later when he heard of this from Dr. Nicholson, he came to me immediately and insist that he write such letters for me. Goertz. . .missed the deadlines for most of the letters which I had specifically specified. That is the major reason that I am still jobless today. Then he promised in May that he would support my work here, however, I haven’t seen any paycheck since then while I have been working here for months after my graduation in May. Later I made some recent progress in extension of my thesis research and submit it to JGR. The response from the referees is favorably for publication after some minor modifications. Goertz first tried to persuade me to present it to JGR by saying that it is too lengthy to be published in GRL. When I pointed out that it is within the limit for GRL, he then tried to force me to add more material to it so it will be delayed for publication after his opinion is published or it be forced to be submitted to JGR under his control . . . Robert Smith . . . Since he is new in the department, he is eager to build his own territory . . . He heard that Shan Linhua is a good student, he then convinced Goertz to have him gradu- ated sooner than most of the others which of course caused wide-spread outrage among the rest of the students. Shan, however, missed the deadline for graduation paperwork, then Smith went to Dwight R. Nicholson, Chairman of the department for personal favor which enables Shan to graduate despite the missing of the graduate college deadline. Trying to justify his act, Smith criticizes me with his eyes closed from the facts that my way of studying the cross-field charge-separation electric field is completely wrong. At that time, everyone in the group was criticizing my study for a whole semester until I am eventually proven correct. Dwight R. Nicholson . . . gave his student . . . an extinguished graduate fellowship even he is not qualified according the graduate college requirement. Nicholson also gave . . . an engineering undergraduate without even a Bachelor degree a 1/2 time graduate research assistantship in physics. What a outrage! He committed fraud (unethical conduct) in the departmental nomination to the “D.C. Spriesterbach Dissertation Award” offered by the graduate college here which was filed by me in a series of complaints to Dr. Rudolph Schultz, Acting Dean of the Graduate College; Dr. Leslie Sims, Dean of the Graduate College; Peter Nathan, Vice President for Academic Affairs; Dr. Anne Cleary, Associated Vice President for Academic Affairs; Dr. Hunter Rawlings III, President since June 1991. The response from various uni- versity officials is, however, disappointed. Up to now, my complaints are still under primary investigation by university officials. I believe they are just trying to coordinates their words to cover this up. Immediately after Dr. Dwight Nicholson nominated Dr. Goertz for some kind of teach/research award from the university and Dr. Cleary called Dr. Goertz, Dr. Goertz came to me saying “if you continue, it will backfire.” What a down-right attempt to cover-up. The whole scene looks pretty like the famous story of “The Count of Monte Cristo” by Alex Dumas. Since then I have sworn to myself that I would revenge at any cost, sooner or later. The misconducts of the said persons would be impossible without the indulgence/coverup by the university authorities. I have been revealing their unethical conducts to Dr. Rudolph Schultz, associate dean of Graduate College; Dr. Leslie Sims, dean of graduate college; Dr. Peter Nathan, Vice President for Academic Affairs; Dr. Hunter Rawlings III, President of the University of Iowa since June 1991. However, they would rather to believe the words of Nicholson than to listen to my words and my evidence. The department/college/university authorities have been in a conspiracy to isolate me, delay my complaint so I might be forced to leave here and they could claim the case dismissed because the absence of the plaintiff. I regret that I have to take extraordinary measure to resolve this matter, but it is simply not my fault. The University of Iowa authorities should be blamed for the unfortunate outcome. If the university had taken positive steps as it is supposed by the tax-payers, tuition payers and funding agencies, all this could be avoided. The University of Iowa is trying its best to cover . . . Nicholson in the DCS dissertation award, in spite of the fact that I am putting my whole career on the line. I am being a physicist who believed in the conservation of matter, energy, momentum, etc. Although my flesh/blood-made body seems dead, my spiritual soul remains perpetual and I am being quantum leaping to another corner of our world. I have finished what I am sup- posed to do here which is to make right what was once wrong. I am proud of my achievement here and I am more confident in my upcoming journey. So long my friends, maybe we will meet again in another time at another place. May the lord bless all those descent human beings who are honest, hard working and truthy.‎Gang Lu
‎When I was a little kid I always dreamed of becoming someone cool. I remember watching cartoons and seeing these characters being immortalized in our every day lives. Every kid knew who “Scooby Doo” was. Every kid knew what a “Pokémon” was. Every kid watched and looked up to someone in his or her life. It didn’t take long for my interest in television and films to grow. I frequently envisioned myself as a character from a television show. As a kid I just took for granted that the shows I watched were what they were. I never realized the amount of work that went into those productions. Little did I know that I would eventually take the tedious and exciting path of bringing my drawings to life. I can talk forever about my fascination with movies, music, and animation. They’ve always been in my life and have played a huge role in making me the person that I am today. Before I go into detail with how I got to where I am today, I need to back up to the very beginning. I was born on Thursday, September 17, 1992 as “Randy Stair”. I have resided in Pennsylvania ever since. I was the first child that my parents had. Two years later on September 11, 1994, my parents had a second son who would become my brother, “Jeremy”. For as long as I can remember, I was always a shy kid. I remember my parents saying how I would bawl my eyes out when they would drop me off at pre- school. I just remember feeling helpless and lost when I was away from them. Every time my teacher would greet me as I walked through the door my head would be down or my eyes would look straight up at the ceiling to avoid eye contact with people. I didn’t hate my teachers, I just hated being acknowledged that I existed. I wanted it to be as if I was a ghost in the room; sitting in class and learning, but not having anyone know that I was there. I’ll never forget about the play that we put on for our parents in preschool. While I don’t remember what the play was about, I can remember standing at the back of the stage with my back turned to the audience; in plain sight. I just zoned out. I just started looking around at anything to take my mind off of the nerve- racking situation. My mind was still developing at that young age but I soon began to realize how powerful it can be, and how emotions can get the best of you. You could say I was a daydreamer; that’s what the average person would say. As time progressed however, it became something much deeper. For some reason I always liked being alone. In elementary school I would see all of these kids in my classes talking with each other, smiling, and acting like they’d known each other for years. I would sit feeling confused and feeling like I was missing something. I wanted to cry whenever group projects would be issued. I was always one of, if not the last person to partner up. I felt like a nobody. Here were all of these kids that conversed with ease and wanted to interact, whereas I would rather sit in the front of the class near the teacher. I desperately wanted people to like me, but at the same time leave me alone completely. It was something beyond being just an introvert. I just felt lost. I started to learn that things couldn’t be handed to you in life. You had to make decisions and you had to make friends on your own. I did make some friends in elementary school. Although I made friends in school I never hung out with them out of school. I was afraid to even call them on the phone. Hell, I was afraid to call my own grandmother on the phone fearing my grandfather would answer; I would always hang up on him. The first sad memory that I can truly say that changed my life was when my friend Michael moved away in first grade. It was emotional for me and I really don’t understand why because I barely knew the kid. I just remember hugging him and fighting back tears on his last day at school. To be fair he wasn’t the coolest kid either. That memory stuck with me for a while for some reason but it had no control over me on trying to make and keep friends. In first grade I met someone who would help make me the person I am today; Matthew Gilbert. We were both big football fans and enjoyed recording with video cameras; it was the perfect combination. He was the first friend that I felt like I could tell anything to. We made a bunch of videos together on mini DV tapes. They started from just simple plots of two boys that wanted to try and find a friend, to parodies of Wes Craven’s, “Scream”. Matt helped me realize my love for the video camera. Whenever we would hang out I can remember begging him to make some videos with me. I didn’t even care what they were about; I just loved to record things with the camera and be able to watch them back on my television later on. I think a big reason why is because I loved to remember the moments we had together as friends and be able to relive them whenever I wanted. It got to a point where he grew tired of repeating the same formula for a video, and we just stopped doing them. I however kept making them with just myself in them. From the first time I ever picked up a video camera and looked into the viewfinder, to the videos I made with Matt, my love for film never faded. I remember watching movies like “Titanic”, “Scream”, “Pirates of the Caribbean”, and “Harry Potter”, and just being in awe of them. I got lost in the visuals, the soundtrack, the dialogue; everything. I wanted to be able to make videos like that. I would just walk around with the video camera and fantasize about what was happening; even though it was just me narrating with a camera angled upwards, twelve inches away from my face. Matt and I eventually went separate ways at the end of ninth grade. He had been in a relationship with a girl for a year or so, and it just limited the amount of time that we could hang out. I just remember feeling enraged. I felt like that girl was more important than I was. I wasn’t in love with the guy but I felt abandoned. I haven’t spoken to him since. I think the last thing I ever said to him was that Brett Favre had retired; him being a die-hard Packers fan. I basically just drifted through elementary and middle school. Matt was my best friend throughout those years; no one remotely came close. The biggest mistake I made was not branching out to other students. For some reason I just didn’t connect with them; always feeling like I was in the wrong class of kids. I had more friends in my brother’s class than my own. It eventually got the point that I just stopped trying and caring to make friends. I was always the isolated, quiet, and shy student; and it never changed. In middle school I met someone who I am decent friends with to this day; James Schwemmer. Like Matt, he really helped influence my life. Although we wouldn’t become friends until ninth grade, James and I would share a strong interest in filmmaking. James was the one who really got me into YouTube and helped motivate me to make content of my own.‎Randy Stair
