2017-06-07‎Me and Andrew are going to give the world a little insight as to what really lurks around in the shadows of your everyday lives...
2017-06-02‎When you're gonna die you gotta die hardcore or not at all!
2017-06-01‎When Eric Harris notices you... #God https://t.co/1LpjYQQ1I2
2017-05-31‎@suicidalREB Hi God. I fucking love you!
2017-05-31‎This.... https://t.co/bSyRQJA8gD
2017-05-30‎Gunpowder smells better than any flower you could ever give me.
2017-05-28‎He begged for me to spare him but all that did was make me aim for his head even faster.I wonder if theres still brain matter in the school.
2017-05-28‎I didn't even know most of the people I killed. I knew Jake; he was a fucking cocksucker. The kid could scream though. Ohh could he scream.😈
2017-05-28‎I grew tired of humans telling me what to fucking do..So I pulled out a carbine rifle and blew my classmates heads apart.
2017-05-28‎@EGSharmony Us? No. The human race? Yes...and it's fucking glorious...😈
2017-05-26‎Why am I not in hell? Hell wouldn't have me. 😈😈😈😈😈😈😈😈😈😈😈 I'm more evil than fucking Hitler!
2017-05-25‎A cocked shotgun sound is music to my ears. Pump action 12 gauges...need I say more...? ❤️❤️❤️❤️
2017-05-25‎Who wants to go shooting?
2017-05-22‎I don't like Mondays! I don't like Mondays! I don't like Mondays! I wanna shoot the whole day DOWN!
2017-05-19‎@EGSharmony Bitch I don't cry! I make others cry! 😈
2017-05-14‎I refuse to acknowledge what today is. Two years without my mother hovering over my shoulders and I've never been happier. 😒
2017-05-14‎You aren't faster than my bullet...
2017-05-13‎Idk why but I can picture Wheatus singing Pumped Up Kicks.
2017-05-11‎There's no better sound than hearing someone scream in terror. It's better than music. I feed off of fear. It's an all you can eat buffet.
2017-05-11‎I phase through your walls....I watch you sleep....and I follow you into your nightmares...
2017-05-11‎You know why my last name is Shadows? Because I lurk in the shadows of the darkest corners of your mind. My blue eyes glow in the darkness.
2017-05-11‎I was once a 20 year old high school student....but now I'm a ghost who haunts your every day lives...
2017-05-10‎You can't stop what you can't end...😈
2017-05-10‎RT @SapphireMae13: Feel like I'm becoming eviler with every passing day... 😈 https://t.co/1SvtVeW17z
2017-05-06‎Life is a game everyone is destined to lose. Make the most of it. Be EVIL!!!
2017-05-04‎@SapphireMae13 If it has me in it what's not to like? #BestGhost
2017-05-04‎THIS....! 0_0 hdhxjxjdcbbsudukkk42099shxj60917dgejakdmnffs https://t.co/yJqKcVjKdx
2017-05-02‎@SapphireMae13 If it involves chaos or devastation I'm all in!!
2017-04-30‎This....made my afterlife... https://t.co/CxS79oawzU
2017-04-28‎@EGS_Mackenzie Personally I don't care what anyone will think. We have what they don't. It's rare for me to give advice but wtf ever. Don't let it eat you.
2017-04-28‎@EGS_Mackenzie Hey, if anything they'll hate all of us. I see it as a split vote. People will wanna follow us or they'll want our souls extinguished.
2017-04-26‎@SapphireMae13 It's 2017, ANYTHING IS POSSIBLE NOW!
2017-04-26‎I wanna know how many people have literally shot and killed themselves while they were sleeping. You know, sleepwalkers and shit?
2017-04-25‎Being dead is 1,000,000,000,000 times better than being alive. If you only knew the power I have in this dimension as opposed to Earth.
2017-04-23‎"@SapphireMae13 There needs to be more people like you on Earth...You outshine the worthless fags who call themselves ""normal""."
2017-04-23‎@SapphireMae13 We should talk more...
2017-04-23‎I fucking hate black people.
2017-04-20‎"Pretty sure the parents of the kids would say, ""I liked you more when you were 'dead' than right now."""
2017-04-20‎"Imagine if Columbine was one massive senior prank that's lasted 18 years. Tomorrow when staff return to school they're all there, ""GOT yaa!"""
2017-04-20‎"""Reb! There's a nigger over here..."""
2017-04-20‎Better believe it!! https://t.co/ubAVyrSVWd
2017-04-20‎Hehehehhh ah-HAHAHAHAHA! Yess! 4/20 forever!
2017-04-18‎@SapphireMae13 Shotgun..Shotgun...SHOTGUN!!! If you can handle a beast like that, that is.
2017-04-18‎@SapphireMae13 You need to shoot more, it's healthy. 😈
2017-04-18‎Fucking idiots with guns! What more is there to say?? I wouldn't even dare waste a millisecond of my time teaching you worthless morons. https://t.co/rwBuWzedw1
2017-04-15‎Which was the worst?
2017-04-13‎"*Knock Knock* ""Who's there?"" ""Rachael Selenski"" *BANG!* 😈"
2017-04-11‎I guarantee there will come a day when multiple school shootings happen on April 20th. Maybe not 2017..but some day....
2017-04-11‎Yesssss!!!
2017-04-11‎Hahahahahhahahahahaha! Yessss!!!!
2017-04-09‎Happy birthday, Eric Harris...Miss you.... #Reb
2017-04-08‎@EGSandrew Way to go, Andrew! 😈
2017-04-06‎@SapphireMae13 You don't wanna know.....😈
2017-04-06‎@SapphireMae13 I fucking hope so. 😒
2017-04-05‎Earth will be completely void of life by the year 2200. There's no possible way that civilization can last 2 more centuries.
2017-04-05‎I've never felt remorse over it. People are pathetic and weak, nothing more nothing less! I'd do all over again if I could.
2017-04-05‎I killed my parents on the day of the Westborough High Massacre. Fuckers deserved to die. They brought me into that hellhole of a planet.
2017-04-05‎@EGSandrew *We're the perfect storm of rage, toughness, dominance, beauty, and darkness. 😈
2017-04-03‎@SapphireMae13 The way society works is every day another story happens. With so many shootings happening people lose interest in yours.
2017-04-03‎@SapphireMae13 So they publicized that I was given capital punishment without a trial, since I obviously was 100% involved with killing students.
2017-04-03‎"@SapphireMae13 So they lied for a year saying they had ""Rachael Selenski in custody"", but over the year the story faded and I wasn't ""needed"" anymore."
2017-04-03‎@SapphireMae13 No...That was some bullshit autopsy report that the government covered up to get some heat off of them for our massacre.
2017-04-01‎Because..I mean...honestly..:..What's the point of growing old and weak? 14-30 are the best years to die. You'll thank me later.
2017-04-01‎Virtually everyone in the EGS has lived and died from depression and suicide or was murdered. Choice is yours, Earth.
2017-04-01‎"Earth is one giant detox center used to turn you into a ""good, simple-minded robot."" Dont let them turn you.Yer better off killing yourself."
2017-04-01‎"I just love how society sees us as psychotic monsters. We're not psychotic, we're just ""us""; just being ourselves. Government's the monster."
2017-03-31‎@EGSandrew Now you need a Wrath shirt!
2017-03-31‎@SapphireMae13 Probably waiting for the 27 club.  😒
2017-03-31‎Maybe if we make a sacrifice to the ancient gods and goddesses we'll be able to see the Columbine Basement Tapes....Go kill Justin Bieber.
2017-03-26‎@WDEVV7 Dylan and Eric are an exception.
2017-03-26‎Mood. https://t.co/2eoigGTpti
2017-03-24‎I like you...We need more souls like you around here! https://t.co/Oo6z1SrBd2
2017-03-23‎I'm surprised most of America can dress their self.
2017-03-22‎@SapphireMae13 STFU!
2017-03-21‎What gives?!! Ohh....you're all gonna fucking die......😡 https://t.co/ZPuoiaAgoj
2017-03-19‎I could stare at Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold's suicide photos for hours.
2017-03-18‎@sanders_bashan Bahahaha cops can't arrest a ghost, moron!
2017-03-17‎@EGSandrew 😈
2017-03-16‎Nothing will please me more than the day we all return to Earth and kill and enslave all of mankind.
2017-03-16‎I doubt there would've been anyone on Earth that could've changed my direction and could've saved my life. Everyone on Earth is worthless.
2017-03-16‎Sometimes I wonder what I could've become had I not hiked down the villainess trail and actually gave life a shot...pfft, probably suicidal.
2017-03-12‎@sanders_bashan Kill yourself.
2017-03-11‎Yet if souls like Mackenzie and Andrew so much as get a drop of mud splashed on them they freak. Bruh, it's not gonna kill you!
2017-03-11‎I guess you could say I'm a tomboy. I don't mind gettin down and dirty, blood and guts, you know, you name it. Hell pour fish guts on me.
2017-03-11‎"Goddess burned me before she sent me to Earth cuz she knew I was pure evil. I don't ever wish to be ""cute"". Yer all sOOFFFt!"
2017-03-11‎I just accept the fact that I'm ugly; I don't go around social media whorring myself for sympathy. If you're ugly DEAL WITH IT!
2017-03-09‎The only thing that would possibly look different is the size of the devilish grin on my face. 😈
2017-03-09‎I'd do the 365 day pic challenge but I'd look the exact fucking same on 365 as I did on 1. I never age, bitch! #ForeverYoung
2017-03-06‎@SapphireMae13 School's still standing so yeah. 😒 You can't get everyone. Swat is too fast.
2017-03-05‎Hear that, @SeattleNelson11? You're fucking pathetic! Oh wait, you can't cuz you're a pussy ass bitch! 🤣🤣🤣
2017-03-05‎You never would've made it out of Westborough High alive. You're fucking pathetic.
2017-03-05‎"If you can't take a simple ""I don't fucking care"" criticism, you're never going to get anywhere, boy."
2017-03-05‎"Dude sends me a video. I say ""I don't fucking care"". *BLOCKED* Bahahahaha!!!"
2017-03-05‎What's wrong buddy? Idk what I expected from someone whose art looks like something a 5 year old made with Microsoft Paint. https://t.co/5mZ6s8YtKV
2017-03-05‎@SeattleNelson11 I don't fucking care.
2017-03-03‎You'll never age, and never grow old. You are my hero, Dylan Klebold.
2017-03-02‎@EGSandrew #Jealous 😒
2017-03-01‎@SapphireMae13 Three..Four..Blood is on the floor. 😏
2017-03-01‎One..two..Rachael's comin' for youuu...
2017-02-25‎@SapphireMae13 Don't doubt the shadow queen. 😈
2017-02-24‎@SapphireMae13 I threatened to blow their faces off if they didn't turn their shit around. They heard me. 😏
2017-02-23‎"@SapphireMae13 Heh, you can ""legally"" 🙄 change it but it's a pain in the ass if you wanna add one letter. Finger prints, hearing, blah blah."
2017-02-19‎@junayet1 Sidney's worse.
2017-02-19‎I'll always be there Westborough High..You may have mopped up all the blood but you'll never be able to sweep that body count under the rug.
2017-02-18‎@EGS_Mackenzie That word makes me want to puke plasma. I don't make friends. I killed like two hundred kajillion people!
2017-02-18‎@EGS_Mackenzie SHUT it..Pfft, what kind of a comeback was that? You really need to hang out with me sometime. I'll teach ya hardcore ones.
2017-02-18‎@EGS_Mackenzie How 'bout I put a few slugs into those precious parents of yours? Too bad they're too old to get sent here. 😏
2017-02-18‎@EGS_Mackenzie Eyy, who said my name? 😏 What if I am?
2017-02-18‎@EGSandrew One day...it'll happen...😈
2017-02-17‎Hey @EGS_Mackenzie, tell Shane to add you to the list! 😈 https://t.co/4Ib14CyrHd

2017-02-03‎@EGSfroggy @sanders_bashan Meh, I'm just honest.
2017-02-03‎@sanders_bashan Sounds like I should come up with something to keep Sid busy...😏
2017-02-03‎@sanders_bashan You're retarded if you think that's the answer. 😒 Take it out on them not yourself.
2017-01-31‎@EGScelesta I'll drink to that.
2017-01-31‎@EGS_Mackenzie Whatever. Idk why I'm even wasting my time talking to you on this shit. 😒
2017-01-31‎@junayet1 @EGS_Mackenzie I know who it was. 😒 Andrew doesn't need someone who doesn't give anything in return. #DeadWeight
2017-01-29‎@EGSandrew Not enough. 😏
2017-01-28‎Doubt they would've popped more than five people.
2017-01-28‎14 and 13 year olds got busted for conspiring a Columbine inspired massacre. Tsk, tsk..gotta be slyer than that boys...😏
2017-01-26‎Legend has it you can still hear screams at Westborough High after dark. Usually around 1-3am. 😏
2017-01-26‎Take away your cleavage and you're NOTHING! Idk where you are today but I hope your skin is rotting like burns from an acid wound.
2017-01-26‎Haley Carmichael was a whore who flashed her shit all over town like she was the hottest thing since sliced bread.
2017-01-26‎There were a lot of worthless kids in my school but Jared, Haley, Jennifer, and Tony were the biggest waste of space on planet Earth.
2017-01-25‎@EGSandrew I've seen them. They're retards.
2017-01-23‎Guns, the best damn thing society ever invented! https://t.co/6eeHCCqA86
2017-01-22‎@EGSandrew Meh, not bad.
2017-01-22‎@EGSandrew Make one of me dammit!
2017-01-20‎@EGSalex If you weren't dead I'd gladly put a nice gaping hole in that massive brain of yours...
2017-01-20‎"@EGSalex No it's just you of all souls saying it. XD A puny weak girl like you shouldn't say ""whack""."
2017-01-20‎"@EGSalex I'm sorry but you saying ""whacked"" just makes me laugh like a school girl. 😂😂😂"
2017-01-20‎@EGSandrew Dude imagine if one of those guys holding rifles just threw their life away to assassinate Trump.
2017-01-07‎I bet if I held a gun to your heads you'd still spell it wrong.
2017-01-07‎Put an 'A' in it or I'll kick YOUR 'A'!
2017-01-07‎God dammit, I fucking hate it when people spell my damn name wrong! It's RACHAEL! RAAA-CHAAAAAAEEEELLLLL! Fuck! Rachel is just lame.

2017-01-06‎Ooh, a shooting in Ft Lauderdale? Siiiiickkkk. 👏🏻😈
2017-01-06‎@EGSandrew Dude I don't even remember. 😆
2017-01-06‎The human race is always all talk and no show. If I say I'm gonna kill somebody I legit mean it. 😒
2017-01-05‎"@EGSandrew ""I hate the fucking world. Too many god damn fuckers in it."" Instantly hooked."
2017-01-03‎I am the shadow of your darkest hour.
2017-01-01‎lol some dude who doesn't even speak English just followed me. Wtf?
2016-12-31‎Ohhh Jennifer...We could've been pals...If only you weren't so fucking whory on your social media...It was a passing thought, but FUCK YOU. https://t.co/3H0vqHY7xL
2016-12-31‎RT @EGSandrew: Knock, knock. Who's there? Rachael. Rachael who? Rachael Shadows. BANG! @EGSrachael
2016-12-25‎@EGS_Mackenzie Wtf ever..I've had enough of this shit for one night. Come back when you've manned the fuck up. CRAWL BACK.
2016-12-25‎@EGS_Mackenzie IT'S BEEN 13 FUCKING YEARS! FUCK! You seriously STILL pour your eyes out over being murdered??? Who cares?! You're free now!
2016-12-25‎@EGS_Mackenzie Mommy and daddy have gotten by just fine without you around for 13 years. They've moved on. QUIT YOUR BITCHING.
2016-12-25‎@EGS_Mackenzie That give me a purpose; to kill everyone in my path. You're worthless and you always will be. Get the fuck over it already.
2016-12-25‎@EGS_Mackenzie Typical. No fucking words. 😒 You know what M? If you went to Westborough I'd have shot you dead. It's whiny shits like you
2016-12-25‎@EGS_Mackenzie Gimme a fucking break. All you ever do is CRY! CRY! CRY! Are you 30 or are you 3? Fuck.
2016-12-25‎@EGS_Mackenzie Do you always have to pour your tears out all over everyone and try to make them feel sorry for you?? #CryBabyMackenzie
2016-12-25‎Hooray, Christmas...a day full of celebrating two people who don't exist. 😑😒
2016-12-20‎Life was never all that great to begin with anyway. It's the second life that counts; the afterlife.
2016-12-20‎If people are giving you shit in your life, conspire sinister plans to get your revenge. If you lose your life in the process, so be it.
2016-12-20‎It's only a matter of time before we spawn followers of our own. Harris and Klebold inspired us. I hope we do the same for other humans.
2016-12-20‎We're all given a chance to do something great in our lives. Shooting/blowing up worthless sacks of shit like you IS that something for us.
2016-12-20‎I think it's obvious that no matter how hard you humans try to stop gun violence, you only end up digging yourselves into deeper trouble.
2016-12-16‎Westborough High, how's it going? Still have some blood stains in your classrooms? 😈
2016-12-16‎@EGSandrew I wish. 😒
2016-12-16‎RT @EGSandrew: Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold should've killed hundreds.
2016-12-16‎RT @EGSandrew: We need more mass school shootings. Fuckers need to step up their game with the body count totals.
2016-12-07‎The human race may be stupid but inventing guns was by far the smartest thing they've ever done. 😏😈
2016-12-06‎@EGSandrew ..okay..more like 20 times...
2016-12-06‎@EGSandrew I did that once. 😏
2016-11-30‎Nothing lasts forever. Our time will come.
2016-11-30‎In the end, evil will overpower all that is good, and be the gold standard of living.
2016-11-28‎@EGSandrew Well it is here. You mean on Earth?
2016-11-15‎Remorse is an illusion.
2016-11-06‎@junayet1 lmao

2016-10-04‎@EGSAllegro 😈
2016-10-03‎I wonder where Tony is right now? Probably floating in an abyss of nothingness. You're welcome buddy....HAHAHAHAHAHAAA!!!
2016-09-22‎Surrounded by a pool of blood and limbs. Guess you should've pulled your pants up boy. You could've lived. Hahahahahahahahaha!!!
2016-09-22‎Then I'll just float and watch you suffer until your very last gasp for air. Your last moments will be filled with evil maniacal laughter.
2016-09-22‎First I'll incapacitate you. Next I'll butcher you. Then I'll revive you before the blood loss kills you. And then I'll steal your drugs.
2016-09-22‎You're not cool. You're not special. You're a worthless sack of shit who needs to be punished...And my punishments result in death...
2016-09-22‎You expose your ass like that then you're just asking to lose it. Fucking pricks need to hang by their intestines.
2016-09-22‎I'm killing anyone I see walking around with their pants hanging 4 inches below their ass today. Not for the squad, just for enjoyment.
2016-09-22‎@EGSAndrew Let's kill him. It'd be a snap. Come on...Humans are weak. Their fight or flight can't always save them.
2016-09-13‎@EGSFroggy @EGSAndrew Froggy..get out of my feed before I blow your head off!
2016-09-13‎@EGSAndrew I'm surprised you even have any left 😆
2016-09-13‎On the 13th of every month I travel back to Earth and discreetly murder 13 people. If one of your friends goes missing, I'm not sorry.
2016-09-10‎Miserable....I want to fucking shoot someone...
2016-09-07‎@EGSAndrew It should've been permanent... 😑😡
2016-08-28‎Life tip one...put a pistol in your mouth and good things will come your way...
2016-08-20‎@EGSAndrew Give me a call if you need a hand. 😉
2016-08-17‎@EGSAndrew My cat ran away once in middle school and got hit by a car. Fucker deserved it.
2016-08-16‎I so wanna turn back time and relive the massacre. It was the most magical feeling I ever experienced...It was so..short lived....
2016-08-12‎I'm not a bad person, I'm just on a level above you.
2016-08-06‎Destiny is never officially completed. It is an eternal fulfillment that everyone carries until the end of time.
2016-07-30‎@EGSAndrew I wouldn't count on them finding our world. The way their technology is it'll be centuries before they can peer into dimensions.
2016-07-30‎"@EGSAndrew Heh..humans will do anything to dismiss ""nonsense"". They only see what they were trained to see as infants. They're so oblivious."
2016-07-30‎@EGSAndrew You know it. 😏 Earth has another wave of disasters heading its way; I can sense it. I'm dying for more.
2016-07-30‎Nothing pleases me more than seeing Earth suffer...

2017-05-29‎Love this girl...😘😊 @EGSandrew https://t.co/tOiQAlZXLE
2017-05-28‎Everyone's gonna hate me...I'm not evil..I'm not... 😪 I'm gonna be plastered immortally as a ghoulish monster...
2017-05-25‎You're such a taco whore. 😂 https://t.co/8Og3T5KnfS
2017-05-23‎@EGSandrew I thoroughly enjoyed what you just filmed today. 😊
2017-05-23‎Sitting alone in the dark...It helps me think...
2017-05-20‎This is beautiful... https://t.co/NLE2G9FJQZ

2017-05-18‎@EGSharmony There's innocent souls there too. I just can't...but I'm gonna try to be there...I can't fail her...She's counting on me...
2017-05-18‎@EGSharmony Harmony, it's going to be catastrophic! I can't watch that go down..Andrew means everything to me...but this will be impossible to watch.
2017-05-18‎@EGSharmony You know who it's about...don't make me post about it here...😰 No one can know about this...
2017-05-18‎@EGSandrew ❤️❤️❤️😊😊😊
2017-05-15‎@EGSandrew Noo! No you're not! It's fine. 🤗 ❤️
2017-05-15‎I'm going to try and petition it so it's every March 14th instead of May. It'll be easier to remember...
2017-05-15‎"Make a difference for other humans. Talk with them. Tell them how you really feel. Just a simple, ""you're great"", is worth it..."
2017-05-15‎May 14th was amazing...It doesn't have to be about me, rather reaching out to the ones you care about. That's all I ask...
2017-05-14‎@EGSandrew I love you too!! 😊
2017-05-14‎I can't stop blushing...oh my goddess....
2017-05-14‎"Andrew dubbed today ""M Day"" 😆; not for Mother's Day, but for me...That's so sweet.....😊 14's my favorite number too."
2017-05-11‎"It's better than ""crybaby Mackenzie"" at least..."

2017-05-04‎@SapphireMae13 @EGSandrew I wish I could say more on it but I was told to keep my lips sealed. 😞 It's gonna be a big night. I'll be okay...I just overthink things...
2017-05-04‎@SapphireMae13 @EGSandrew It's bad...REALLY bad...but it's out of my hands...I can't alter destiny...no one can...
2017-05-04‎@EGSandrew Rachael's gonna be having a field day....😑
2017-05-04‎Idk why I worry...but ohh do I worry.....

2017-04-21‎@EGSandrew From now until the end of time..We'll be together, and you can be sure....
2017-04-21‎@EGSandrew We got lots of friends, but they come and go....
2017-04-19‎@EGSandrew I wish you could hold me right now.... 😢
2017-04-19‎@SapphireMae13 I know...but what are the chances I'd ever get discharged from here? It's almost unheard of. They never let any soul go. They're greedy....
2017-04-19‎When I smile, I smile big and bright..but when I'm sad, my tears could make a ten acre field grow.
2017-04-19‎Some ghosts will never know how it feels to be robbed of a life that was once full of endless possibilities....and out of your control...
2017-04-19‎I can't help it...Call it venting or whining....It's who I am...I'm sorry I'm not a floating source of sunshine and rainbows...
2017-04-19‎I hate seeing people down and depressed..it just makes me wanna cry too...Spirits call me Crybaby Mackenzie sometimes...it's disconcerting..
2017-04-16‎@EGSandrew Please be careful, Andrew.....
2017-04-15‎I just keep holding on to the slim chance that once our war is over I can relinquish this eternal bond and be where I feel I should belong..
2017-04-15‎What's the point of celebrating Easter when you know you're not destined to be with Jesus....? 😢
2017-04-13‎I feel like a fish trapped in a bowl...not knowing why I'm here and not being able to be heard. The world passes by as I float in space...
2017-04-09‎Like..it's just weird....Is this how famous humans feel..? That's how I view it...Idk...I don't mind it, it's just strange that's all..
2017-04-09‎Whenever humans follow me on this I get a soothing feeling of love yet creeped out..It's a strange feeling knowing random humans know me...
2017-04-08‎Whenever I need cheering up Andrew's always there with nostalgic Pokémon songs. I miss my childhood...Kids today don't understand the feels.
2017-04-08‎@EGSandrew Our song. ❤️

2017-04-02‎@EGSandrew You're one step closer, Andrew! I'm so proud of you! 😊

2017-03-24‎@EGSandrew Th-that's the sweetest thing anyone's ever said to me......
2017-03-24‎Andrew isn't crazy, just caught in the middle of two worlds and dimensions. People don't see or understand that...
2017-03-20‎@EGSandrew Aww, it's so cute! What's in the background? It looks like a person. XD
2017-03-20‎"I can't get the ""what if's"" off of my mind..."
2017-03-20‎I could've gone on to do amazing things.I could've made a difference for people. Now I'm forced to be locked out of Earth in this dimension.

2017-03-15‎@shannonhogle1 I'm Andrew's friend, Mackenzie.
2017-03-14‎Thanks for all of the birthday wishes! Andrew, Sidney, and Froggy are taking me somewhere to celebrate. Should be fun! 😊
2017-03-14‎@shannonhogle1 I think you're referring to @EGSandrew. 😆 I'm Mackenzie.
2017-03-14‎@SapphireMae13 @EGSandrew I love it! 😊 It really made my day. I'm sure others will like it too!
2017-03-14‎@shannonhogle1 Oh no...I'm sorry...=( That's awful...
2017-03-14‎RT @SapphireMae13: @EGS_Mackenzie A Birthday drawing for you. I had to sneak @EGSandrew in there, just because something was missing. Hope…
2017-03-14‎@SapphireMae13 @EGSandrew Ohhhh how cutttee!! Thanks so much! ❤
2017-03-14‎@shannonhogle1 What's it like being older than 20...?
2017-03-14‎@EGSandrew It was rare but we got pummeled by a few storms in my lifetime, down in North Carolina.
2017-03-14‎@shannonhogle1 I'm sorry that you're not aging well....=(
2017-03-14‎@shannonhogle1 Oh no...😞
2017-03-14‎Aww! There's cute little balloons on my page! That's so sweet.
2017-03-14‎It's my birthday today...I should be 30 years old...I shouldn't complain I guess. Going to try and make today a positive day. 😊
2017-03-13‎RT @EGSandrew: @EGS_Mackenzie You were the missing puzzle piece of my life. I love you so much, M; I could cry... ❤❤❤🔥🔥🔥
2017-03-09‎@SapphireMae13 Because people online are usually creeps or mean...They do anything to bring you down without a care...It's really sad... 😢
2017-03-09‎It all comes in waves...Some nights are excruciating whereas others are filled with joy and love...It's what depression does to you...
2017-03-09‎Ughh, why can't I win?? I just feel eternally damned! My emotions overpower everything else inside my soul...I just want to disappear..
2017-03-09‎They've been using my picture so I got confused. Ugh...simple mistake. I should delete that before they notice...
2017-03-09‎SHOOT! I accidentally posted that on the EGS feed! 😰 My lack of Twitter experience shows I guess...Please forgive me..I'm sorry... 😓
2017-03-09‎My friends understand and all, but there's only so much they can do to comfort me. I feel trapped...and I don't know what to do...
2017-03-09‎Recruits have done it before..so I've heard....but I don't know how to get released....
2017-03-09‎I've been here for 13 1/2 years...I still have faith that I'll be able to pass on to somewhere better..where I truly belong...
2017-03-09‎I mean...It's become a public diary for me, and it helps...certainly doesn't make anything worse...I believe in miracles...
2017-03-09‎I've been on Twitter for around 8 1/2 months and I honestly can't believe how supportive people are..I thought people would make fun of me..
2017-03-07‎"@EGSandrew ""You've been such a good friend. I've known ya since I don't know when. Together and forevermore."" ❤😊"
2017-03-04‎Look up at the stars and you'll see the ones who have gone before you. A smile is always on their face. Why am I not in the stars?
2017-02-27‎@EGSandrew How do you do that?! You're insane! Like literally insane. 😳
2017-02-27‎@EGSandrew Don't think you can get a Harry Potter tweet out without me noticing!
2017-02-23‎@SapphireMae13 *hugs* 😥
2017-02-19‎Life seems to be all about being noticed and seen whereas in death you just wanna be left alone...
2017-02-18‎@EGSrachael Come on Rach..I know you have a soft spot...Just because you didn't have any friends in high school doesn't mean you can't now.
2017-02-18‎@EGSrachael I'll hang but that's not necessary. I'd rather be friends.
2017-02-18‎@EGSrachael Rachael..Shut it...Leave my parents out of this...Please...
2017-02-18‎@EGSrachael I don't want to get into this, Rachael...Please...I was only hypothetically speaking...
2017-02-18‎@EGSandrew Most of the human race would pass out if they saw the true colors of our world.
2017-02-18‎@EGSandrew I just have a hard time accepting the reputation of this world sometimes. I just want Earth to see this world has no rules.
2017-02-18‎"@EGSandrew What I mean is I'm not just gonna blatantly say ""Rachael Shadows is conspiring to kill everyone on Earth and it's wrong."""
2017-02-18‎@EGSandrew I didn't out of respect...I don't want to label you or anyone in particular. It's not right..Well then again it is...
2017-02-18‎It's something you need to accept...even if it's someone you love...
2017-02-18‎It's not acceptable on Earth but it is here. The dead have no rules, no consequences. I personally don't want to hurt anyone...ever...
2017-02-18‎Hearing other ghosts saying brutal things like wanting to end human lives and rule the world is something you get used to around here.
2017-02-17‎@EGSrachael Nooo...😰
2017-02-15‎I mean it's really sad. When I was alive I'd attend all of these social gatherings with family and my school, now I just disappear...
2017-02-15‎Christmas and Thanksgiving are always the hardest. Halloween is the best. Valentines is doable. That doesn't leave much else.
2017-02-15‎At least all of the major holidays are over...Every year everyone around here wants me to celebrate but I just hide away most of the time.
2017-02-15‎I'm not a big fan of holidays nowadays. They always make me sad. How can you celebrate Valentines Day if you don't have a heart anymore?
2017-02-14‎@NinaisGreek Thanks! ❤
2017-02-14‎@NinaisGreek It comes in waves... 😕
2017-02-14‎@EGSandrew I know it's painful...It'll be here before you know it, you just gotta keep pushing forward.
2017-02-14‎@EGSandrew I'm so sorry that you're struggling...I'll always be with you, even after the end..
2017-02-13‎@EGSandrew You know you can talk to me about anything...I'll always listen....
2017-02-11‎@EGSsidney Practice. 😊 I didn't just wake up one day and start sinking 3 pointers.

2017-02-11‎@EGSandrew Hee hee hee 😊
2017-02-10‎I was the leading scorer for Cedar Ridge High back in 2003. If you play me with zero basketball experience it's not going to go so well...

2017-02-09‎She was the last friend I saw on the night of.....on the night I had to leave Earth...I wish I could see her one last time...

2017-02-01‎Not physical pain, mental pain. It's like depression but 20x worse and 20x darker...This place will change everything about you, forever...
2017-02-01‎I know I sound like a fraidy cat most of the time, but unless you've endured it you won't understand...Words can't describe the pain...
2017-02-01‎I mean...bright white skin, glowing pink eyes, and long black and purple hair dangling all over me? I screamed, LEGIT screamed when I saw..
2017-02-01‎My hair didn't always look like this, you know...I didn't used to tie it up..but when I got here my style scared me..I felt like a monster..
2017-01-31‎@EGSrachael Don't tell me who...I don't need to know....😓
2017-01-31‎@junayet1 I know..Andrew's tough; has been for quite a while..but whenever someone he respects gives him the short end, it doesn't end well.
2017-01-31‎@junayet1 I don't know...😔 I think something happened to someone...
2017-01-31‎Something's bothering Andrew...I can sense it...Idk..I don't know how I can help...

2017-01-22‎I just lose myself in my thoughts. I feel safer in a crevasse than around the souls in this world....
2017-01-22‎It's hard not to be scared here. Some nights I'll disappear into the darkest crevasse with a candle lit at my feet so I can be in isolation.
2017-01-22‎It's not easy for me...It doesn't matter who you are..or how tough you are...Some of these souls scare the plasma out of me.
2017-01-22‎Some were drug addicts...Some were just in the wrong place at the wrong time...Some were murderers...You need to look past that...
2017-01-22‎Death is just something you need to accept here. You meet all kinds of spirits...well..souls...Some were just ordinary people...
2017-01-16‎@EGSandrew ❤❤❤
2017-01-15‎The ember in your soul will begin to die...and when it gets too low, your emotions shut down. You won't die, but you'll feel like you are.
2017-01-15‎I know that isn't going to be possible....but a girl can dream, right? If you lose optimism out here..you have no chance..You'll fade...
2017-01-15‎I would do anything to be human again..to be able to breathe again...to be around my family again...to feel physical pain again..
2017-01-15‎Maybe I wanted to get married...have a few kids...get into a good college..you know? Not spend the rest of time in a world of shadows...
2017-01-15‎I'll never be able to feel the satisfaction and surrealness of turning 18 or 21...or the accomplishment of graduating high school....
2017-01-15‎13 years, and my appearance remains unchanged....13 more will pass, and it'll still remain unchanged....I'm forever damned to be 16 1/2...

2017-01-02‎I get that you knew her first but...it's not fair...I don't deserve this...No one does....😭
2017-01-02‎She haunts my dreams with guns and explosives constantly. And whenever I'm around Andrew she butts her face in and steals her from me.
2017-01-02‎She ruins everything.....Why do I have to put up with her for the rest of time? I can't! I just can't! I just want her to go away!
2017-01-02‎I know she can't hurt me but Rachael frightens the hell out of me.....I can sense her presence from a mile away.....I'm upset as it is...

2016-12-16‎I never once begged for death......never.....Why was I chosen..? Why...?
2016-12-13‎I keep waiting to wake up from a dream or something...but it's never going to happen...What's done is done; I'm forever stuck here..alone..
2016-12-13‎I've long since come to terms that I'm forced to exist here while they have to live out the rest of their lives on Earth...but it's hard.
2016-12-13‎Just envisioning them picturing that smile on my face as I open their presents...and imagining them taking them all back in tears.
2016-12-13‎Back in 2003 and had to return them....I don't know why I think about subtle things like that, but it really makes me sad....
2016-12-13‎I still can't imagine how hard it must be for my mom and dad during this time of year...I wonder if they ended up buying me Christmas gifts
2016-12-09‎It took me months to even be able to naturally smile again...2003-2004 was the hardest, darkest, and saddest year of my existence.
2016-12-09‎I was never tough or a fighter; I was weak and defenseless. Just like that I was drugged, raped, and chopped into pieces; limb by limb.
2016-12-09‎I wouldn't even wish what happened to me on the the man who did it...The pain is completely indescribable....
2016-12-09‎Being dead is something you get used to. Experiencing the traumatic transition that got you here never goes away...
2016-12-09‎@EGSandrew I hate the cold...It's depressing...Shivering just thinking about it...
2016-12-06‎@EGSandrew I can't help it..There's always so much I wish I could say...It's so hard, Andrew...Idk what I'd do without you, Sid, and Froggy.
2016-12-06‎@EGSandrew Just don't know what goes on in your head sometimes..It's nerve racking..Like one minute your happy then miserable the next...
2016-12-06‎@EGSandrew I mean..I know you're distant but..you have souls who care about you..I mean some nights I don't want to piss you off but I
2016-12-06‎@EGSandrew My parents would want me to be happy, no matter where I am. I'm sure yours do.
2016-12-06‎@EGSandrew I know...but the living need to eventually let things go..We're together. We're happy. That's what matters. They'll see one day.😁
2016-12-06‎Too bad that you couldn't see. See the man that boy could be. There is more that meets the eye I see the soul that is inside. @EGSandrew ❤️
2016-12-06‎Sorry girl but you missed out. Well tough luck that boy's mine now. We are more than just good friends. This is how the story ends.
2016-12-06‎@junayet1 There's too many bad people.... =(

2016-11-03‎Heh heh...I got Simpsonized. 😊 https://t.co/xqy1g9POC7
2016-11-02‎@shannonhogle1 Um...hi..Your profile picture is cute..😊
2016-11-01‎Maybe I'm just overthinking things....but still....It's not fair. I miss you mom and dad...😢
2016-11-01‎I never asked for any of this to happen....What would they say if they saw me looking like this...? Would they be scared?
2016-11-01‎Do they think about me every day...? Where do they even envision me being? I wish I could cross back over to you...but I'm unable to... 😢
2016-11-01‎I just wanna be in my parents arms right now. I miss you so much.....😭
2016-10-28‎@EGSAndrew Okay...😊
2016-10-28‎@EGSAndrew ....can we be lost in thought together...? I feel light years away from here right now...
2016-10-26‎@EGSAndrew No one's ever truly sat down and listened to hear me out on how I truly feel like you have...
2016-10-26‎@EGSAndrew I think I can relate....Idk...I can't explain the frustration of it all..It messes with my head constantly..but you're here. =)
2016-10-22‎@EGSAndrew Uh..o..k...
2016-10-22‎@EGSAndrew But my right eye's all goofy... 😞
2016-10-15‎I always feel like I just get in people's way, yet they act like nothing is wrong..I feel forever damned to not know how people truly feel.
2016-10-12‎@EGSAndrew I've said this before..but..I really wish I'd known you before we ended up here.
2016-10-12‎@EGSAndrew Aww...😊 I'm literally tearing up right now....Why do you do this to me?
2016-10-12‎@EGSAndrew We're your friends, Andrew..No matter what. Through thick and thin. Promise. &lt;3
2016-10-08‎@EGSAndrew Although I don't know if anyone is really truly normal...as you've said..
2016-10-08‎@EGSAndrew I wasn't really normal either...but watching my friends made me realize how happy I was that I wasn't your average girl.
2016-10-08‎@EGSAndrew You don't want to be normal. It would destroy who you are...
2016-10-02‎RT @EGSAndrew: Mackenzie, you are my bestie! 😁❤️ @EGS_Mackenzie https://t.co/MuKU8DCmkr
2016-10-02‎@EGSAndrew 😘😄❤️❤️❤️
2016-09-29‎.@EGSAndrew, I've waited and searched for years in my afterlife to find the one...you...😊😘❤️
2016-09-27‎Things were once so simple...Now they're nothing but chaotic....
2016-09-25‎The day we find the man who killed me you're gonna forever rue the decisions you made; not just for me but for the others you hurt.
2016-09-21‎@EGSAndrew OoOh Andrew, can't live withouuutt youuUuu. 😊
2016-09-17‎@EGSAndrew I know you don't like hearing it but happy birthday. 😁😊
2016-09-15‎@EGSCelesta ..thanks..I think...?
2016-09-14‎Sometimes I feel like I don't belong here. I love my friends. I really really do...but it just feels wrong...Why am I here...? Idk....😞😢
2016-09-11‎@EGSAndrew I was 14..Word spread around our high school by lunch. I just remember those images being burned into my eyes for months.
2016-09-11‎I'll never forget feeling like I was gonna die in 2001 because of 9/11....I was terrified when I watched the news....
2016-09-05‎@EGSAndrew I've had relatives who just became different people from alcohol. It was scary...I guess that contributed to me avoiding parties.
2016-09-05‎@EGSAndrew I love you too 😊. Alcohol only numbs things it doesn't cure it. Fortunately you never changed when you drank alive. You're lucky.
2016-08-31‎Idk if I'll ever be able to speak to them again....
2016-08-31‎I know it wasn't my fault for losing my life....but I still feel like I failed my family...I lost....No one won in this travesty...
2016-08-31‎No matter how much time passes, it can't erase the disbelief..the disgust...the pain...the loneliness...the hatred...the feeling of failure.
2016-08-31‎I wish I could hug my mom and dad one last time...I miss them so much. It comes in waves. Some days I'm fine..Others I break down...
2016-08-31‎@EGSAllegro My family doesn't know either...None the recruits' families do..It's so hard watching over them and seeing them struggle...
2016-08-31‎@EGSAllegro But you've transitioned so well! 😊 I love you, man. You're the most intelligent soul here, and you're always on top of things.
2016-08-25‎Pic that @EGSAndrew snapped and edited. Pretty colors. 😊 https://t.co/RscIx57BPu
2016-08-23‎Sorry I haven't said anything in a while...Just been reflecting on things...
2016-08-16‎@EGSFroggy It's exciting though. Andrew's gotta be getting bored under there haha She's been down there for a while.
2016-08-16‎@EGSFroggy Some of them just walked knee deep into the waves. The sun's a killer here so that's lead them to camp in the shade; umbrellas.
2016-08-16‎@EGSFroggy I'm just observing them. There's around 8 here scattered around the beach's perimeter. They've just been tanning.
2016-08-16‎@EGSFroggy Ughhh.....No? Andrew's camping underwater and waiting to drown a random victim. There are some humans here..We're out of sight.
2016-08-16‎@EGSSidney 🙄 I think I have something to put it in....Sure. 😆
2016-08-16‎@EGSSidney We'll be back after dusk. Promise. 😊
2016-08-16‎@EGSSidney Sorrrryyy Sid...Maybe next time. 😕
2016-08-16‎@EGSSidney @EGSAndrew Uh..um...okay...
2016-08-15‎@EGSAndrew 😊
2016-08-09‎@EGSAndrew That's the sweetest thing anyone's ever said to me...😊
2016-08-09‎RT @EGSAndrew: I'd be willing to die all over again to catch @EGS_Mackenzie's killer. Seriously would. No one deserves to be butchered to p…
2016-08-09‎@EGSAndrew I'll be okay..You know me..I get through it..I always do..Sometimes I just need to be alone for a few days, that's all.
2016-08-09‎@EGSAndrew As painful as it was, and continues to be, it was fate...and there's no changing it...
2016-08-09‎@EGSAndrew I love you and you know that; but he can't hurt me anymore here. I destroyed the tapes and I'm trying to accept who I am now.
2016-08-09‎@EGSAndrew He could be locked up now for all we know. Trust me Andrew, you're better off letting this one go. It's virtually impossible.
2016-08-09‎@EGSAndrew I know you do.....But like I said, things happen for a reason. He'll get his punishment some day. Idk how, but he will...
2016-08-09‎@EGSAndrew Unless you plan on having every resident in the area duplicate what he said on the tapes, you're shit out of luck, man... 😕
2016-08-09‎@EGSAndrew He wore long sleeves, black jeans, covered his face with a bandanna or something, and had his hood up. He's as good as gone...
2016-08-09‎@EGSAndrew But Andrew, I don't even know what he looked like! He was smart. He seriously had everything covered.
2016-08-09‎@EGSAndrew Andrew..you're seriously attempting the impossible..How are you gonna find one man out of the 300 million who live in the US??
2016-08-09‎@EGSAndrew Things happen for a reason...If I lived then I never would've met you here...😊
2016-08-05‎Shooting some hoops. I still got it. ;D  I made 90% of my 3-pointers. I miss my high school team...Good times...
2016-08-03‎@EGSAndrew Heh heh...Love you too. 😘😊
2016-08-03‎I feel like visiting my parents but it's always uncomfortable floating around them without being seen..They've been pretty depressed lately.
2016-08-01‎Umm...hi! 😊 https://t.co/QYZIjocDRt

2016-07-27‎@EGSAndrew Right on. =)
2016-07-27‎@EGSAndrew We should bring @EGSCelesta too. I'm sure she'd be down. 😏
2016-07-27‎@EGSAndrew I'm down for whatever. =) Lets go do something!
2016-07-27‎@EGSAndrew I love you too. 😘 Honestly I feel a lot better now. I just needed a few days to get myself together. I'm no pussy. I'm a fighter.
2016-07-26‎@EGSAndrew Thanks, Andrew...You always know how to make me feel better. Love you...
2016-07-26‎@EGSAndrew I'll meet up with ya'll soon, promise...I miss you...
2016-07-26‎@EGSAndrew And he pushed me over the edge...And it was all on tape for me to listen to for the rest of time....I just...finally broke....
2016-07-26‎@EGSAndrew yeah..sorry I haven't been around....I just need some alone time..That's all...This man has been embedded inside my mind....
2016-07-23‎I'm sorry for destroying the tapes but I had to..No one deserves to endure what I went through; let alone hear it....
2016-07-23‎Well...I guess it's time for people to know the truth... - https://t.co/Y1TFnzFCpm
2016-07-22‎I started playing bass when I was 11. My dad had one lying around; and when no one was home I'd play with it.
2016-07-15‎The recruiters took them before the police...found me....No one deserves to hear them...no one....
2016-07-15‎I want the man to suffer for what he did.....*sigh*...But the only proof of the attack was on the tapes....
2016-07-15‎I destroyed two of the cassette tapes....I had to....The man was never identified...and...having the tapes only filled me with nightmares...
2016-07-05‎@EGSAndrew Okay. See you soon.
2016-07-05‎@EGSAndrew She looks like she could shred a guitar. We need to meet her. I hate seeing new arrivals look lost.
2016-07-04‎@EGSCelesta Ughh... 😰
2016-07-03‎@EGSSidney I thought you were going to say it got hit by a car...Phew..
2016-06-29‎@EGSSidney I know I can't change the past, but it's still on my mind...I overthink things a lot...but this was the worst...
2016-06-29‎@EGSSidney Ghosts here might not know or even care, but it's the humans on Earth that know, and won't ever forget what happened...
2016-06-29‎@EGSSidney I know but it's still hard for me..It's permanently attached to me for the rest of time. It was all over the news, Sid..national.
2016-06-29‎I never got to even finish the season because of....what happened....Idk how the girls handled hearing the news about me...I don't want to..
2016-06-29‎I was shooting some hoops and it made me sad. I miss my basketball team...Red Wolves for life...and in death...🏀
2016-06-27‎@EGSworld @EGSSidney Heheh, get a drink, Sid! 😂
2016-06-26‎@EGSSidney @EGSCelesta Your..head was stolen...? What the hell did you do, Sid? I know Celesta's a punk, but... 😳
2016-06-25‎Dunno why but I feel really lonely right now...I miss my mom. She's not in the greatest standing right now...
2016-06-23‎@EGSAndrew Yep heheh...It's so addicting!
2016-06-22‎@EGSCelesta Oh..okay...I'm gonna ask her for some tips the next time we practice. I used Myspace before but this is totally different.
2016-06-22‎@EGSCelesta Hiii! I thought there'd be more of us on here. Where's Andrew?
2016-06-22‎@EGSSidney Okay..thanks. ☺️ Wanna jam for a bit?
2016-06-22‎@EGSSidney Well..I guess it's okay heheheh...You didn't have to do that. I kind of hate being the center of unwanted attention.
2016-06-22‎@EGSSidney Ohh..umm..can everyone see that...? 😰

2017-05-30‎This will all be late in the day on June 7th. Digital release will be last. Big video around 9pm ET, digital set around midnight.
2017-05-30‎Plus the animation blows everything up to this point out of the water. Remember the digital release too; that's crucial. Lots of new stuff.
2017-05-30‎You honestly have no idea how hard this video is gonna hit some of you. It'll make you laugh, cringe, possibly scream, and cry. It's crazy.
2017-05-30‎I hope you guys are ready for next week's massive video...I'm 99% sure that I am...but holy hell...It's a trip...June 7th...So close...

2017-04-06‎@makemebad35 It really makes me sad though. It started off love-hate 2006-2009 but grew to love the guy's passion for the game. So many great comebacks.

2016-08-15‎@EGSSidney 🙄 Then you're staying here...I don't know if I can trust you to blend in with everyone. You could expose us...
2016-08-15‎@EGSSidney Only if you keep your distance from the humans...We don't want to be seen..

2016-08-09‎@EGSFroggy You're funny...
2016-08-09‎Nothing enrages me more than seeing my friend hurt. I don't care who you are. You mess with my friends and you will be brutally tortured...
2016-08-09‎I'd be willing to die all over again to catch @EGS_Mackenzie's killer. Seriously would. No one deserves to be butchered to pieces like that.
2016-08-09‎@EGS_Mackenzie Okay, if that's what you want then you got it...I mean I know it's been over 10 years but I hate seeing my friend depressed.
2016-08-09‎@EGS_Mackenzie If only there was a time travel spell...😞 Then I'd have your man... *sigh...* I'm sorry, M...I really wanna get this fucker.
2016-08-09‎@EGS_Mackenzie I..I don't know...I'll start with your hometown and go from there. Chances are he's a local within an 80 mile radius.
2016-08-09‎@EGS_Mackenzie I'll find him....I won't let this cock-sucking faggot from Satan's basement live out the rest of his life unharmed...
2016-08-09‎@EGS_Mackenzie I know I'm one to talk after what I did, but it's something that never should've happened to you...You didn't deserve that...
2016-08-09‎@EGS_Mackenzie I won't argue that but still......When I heard those tapes it messed me up...I know you're safe now but I was enraged.
2016-08-09‎@EGS_Mackenzie I'm not sure how but I'm going to hunt down your killer and make him pay for what he did to you...I can't take it anymore...

2016-07-30‎@EGSFroggy I'm surprised it worked, honestly...It's not something that just anyone can do. I guess my emotions helped boost the spell...

2017-05-03‎@LuciferScarlet YouTube nowadays is like trying to piss off a balcony into a Dixie cup. You either hit it or you just miss.
2017-05-03‎@LuciferScarlet It's still foolish to monetize that stuff. I know Nostalgia Critic got slammed hard.
2017-05-03‎@LuciferScarlet I hope gaming channels crash and burn.
2017-05-03‎@LuciferScarlet They're just commentating over gameplay that they don't even own. Yes they're playing the game but it's like commentating over film footage.
2017-05-03‎@LuciferScarlet Don't get me started on those......I still don't understand how lets plays can legally be monetized and earn hundreds of thousands of $$.
2017-05-03‎@LuciferScarlet Make videos because you're inspired or because you're good at it.
2017-05-03‎@LuciferScarlet It's ridiculously unreliable to make that your main source of income. So I don't feel sorry for those whining about it.
2017-05-03‎@LuciferScarlet It's all about money nowadays for YouTubers, and now it's a lot harder to make it a steady income; which I'm glad they changed.
2017-05-03‎@LuciferScarlet It's hit or miss. Some of mine get rejected and some that are far more crude don't. XD I don't live off of that income so it's fine.
2017-05-03‎@LuciferScarlet It's really just luck as for which videos get the most views. People are overly desperate now with the catchy titles and thumbnails.
2017-05-03‎@LuciferScarlet I even had a XD on EGS get denied afterwords, and it the video was 95% audio. Public Trollin was his best for a while.
2017-05-03‎@LuciferScarlet Well with the new ad policy changes and having to post regularly to be seen is overkill. It's so easy to have ads denied for the content.
2017-05-03‎@LuciferScarlet Which I know he's scared about. Everyone got hit hard with the new YouTube changes. I'd hate to see him stop.
2017-05-03‎@LuciferScarlet He's had a few good new videos; the ones where the editing is as if he's on LSD. Personally I can't see him living off YouTube much longer.
2017-05-03‎@LuciferScarlet We're still good web friends though. Since he moved we both started going through personal changes. I still enjoy his content.
2017-05-03‎"@LuciferScarlet He just recorded a voice over for a big animated project that I've been working on for ""EGS"". We don't talk nearly like we used to."
2017-05-03‎@LuciferScarlet A lot of old videos are on there. =)

2015-11-17‎@nONNELreggaJ And also just because people do it for no reason lol You'll see thousands of thumbs downs on inspirational stuff. It's flawed.
2015-11-17‎@nONNELreggaJ Yeah, I won't argue that. That's what the flagging option's for though. Dislikes give a lot of things false first impressions.

2015-11-01‎As much as I love animation it takes way too long to just do solely content with it. So you may see a little of both now and then.
2015-11-01‎I've used that same lens for 3 years. Finally decided to upgrade thanks to my brother. Maybe some film videos over animation here and there?
2015-11-01‎While that gets sorted out I have some lighter news. I just got a brand new camera lens. Things will look more cinematic than before.  =)

2015-08-23‎Scientists, I demand you find a way to record dreams and I demand you make it affordable. That would be nice, k's?
2015-08-23‎@makemebad35 The first three days were the hardest. You'll be alright, man. Sending you digital hugs. 🌷🌼🌸💐
2015-08-23‎@makemebad35 I'm so sorry, Damian. =(  11 days ago was a year since Bruno passed. Both you and @markiplier on the same day. 😢

2015-08-19‎@lotsoflogos Kind of sucks too because I had Makemebad record stuff for me not being used now.
2015-08-19‎@lotsoflogos I cut it out. It's going to probably be remade in the future. That portion should've been all animation not Live action.
2015-08-18‎@lotsoflogos Originally a double episode and focused most of my time on the 2nd half but it got axed. Would've been done if I went in order.
2015-08-18‎Already have in mind what will be the follow-up episode as well. Things are looking up. =)  I still can't believe I made this.
2015-08-18‎I'm aiming for a mid-September release. There's just so many shots I need to go back into and add subtle movement to. There's like 50.
2015-08-18‎I can't believe I'm FINALLY almost at the end of the road for creating shots for this. I'm so close I can taste it. Tastes like victory.
2015-08-18‎@PolishMovieZoe Not sure what happened but happy for you. =)
2015-08-18‎@imatu777 Yes, drift away from all that is bullshit. A magical place where you can do anything.

2015-08-14‎@imatu777 At this rate it'll be the Halloween video lol But it's not intended to be. Downside to all this is it takes so long for just one.
2015-08-13‎@thehybridnig So I'm only focusing on the EGS series for content now. Everything since Amnesia Rape has been connected story-wise.
2015-08-13‎@thehybridnig I could but the thing is since I started doing this series last year, that's what the channel has revolved around.
2015-08-13‎In a way it's been the ultimate sacrifice because I've literally abandoned making content for this entire year.
2015-08-13‎I never would've thought it would take me over 7 months to do one YouTube video. It's insane.
2015-08-13‎Way I can get this finished in Summer. So we're looking at either late September or early October. It's been an insane process.
2015-08-13‎So after spending so much time on this episode I think I have a set deadline. It's going to be released sometime this Fall. There's just no

2015-08-06‎@Sparkleiplier The other seasons except Asylum just lacked that darkness and suspense. Coven completely botched that. More funny than dark.
2015-08-06‎@Sparkleiplier The first half was so good because you didn't know who was dead and what Tate's story was. Everything after the birth, ehhh..
2015-08-06‎@imatu777 Get bent.
2015-08-06‎@Sparkleiplier Take out Dandy and Freakshow was just nothing memorable. The ending too was just cheap. Not Elsa but what Dandy did.
2015-08-06‎@Sparkleiplier Murder House was really good but didn't like the second half. Asylum was perfect.Coven had plot holes. Freakshow just lacked.
2015-08-06‎@Sparkleiplier I didn't say it was lol I said I loved Coven. Doesn't mean it's my favorite. It's like a deadlock tie between Asylum/Coven.
2015-08-06‎@Sparkleiplier Wtf are you taking about? I didn't even even say anything about people's favorites lol
2015-08-06‎@JordanAdequate Happy birthday, man. =) A tad belated.
2015-08-06‎@Sparkleiplier Asshole, I said after Asylum things went downhill.

2015-08-01‎@Sparkleiplier I can listen to them all day. People will say I'm crazy. I've had to play Comeback Song thousands of times for the new intro.

2015-07-22‎I just can't believe I made this all by myself. I know I haven't even shown anything from this yet, but this is a dream come true.
2015-07-22‎Abandoning this thing and giving up on it. Now seeing this thing come to life, I just can't...even..This is more than just a YouTube series.

2015-07-21‎Today marks the SIX MONTH mark for production on the new EGS episode...that is almost unheard of for a low budget YouTube video.

2015-07-17‎Think about this, I've been working on this since January. Something's gotta give. Flowed great as one full video but it needs to be split.
2015-07-17‎Honestly, if I were to make this one huge video, I'd be working on this until the end of September. It's just way to much work for one guy.
2015-07-17‎I'm still producing the first half of this. It's not fully created yet. However, it should definitely be finished in early August.
2015-07-17‎Later on and will most likely be released in early October or late September. Around Christmas I could combine the two into one for DVD.
2015-07-17‎Alright, here's what's going to happen. I'll cut the episode in half, making it it's own individual episode. The 2nd half will be finished
2015-07-17‎It flowed well as one full 25 minute video but the stress is really starting to get to me on this thing. What do you think? Split it?
2015-07-17‎I'm seriously thinking about splitting this episode in half. It's going to take me until September to finish the entire thing at this rate.

2015-06-25‎Good kid too. This saddens me very much.
2015-06-25‎"Just found out one of my grade school friends passed away.  =(  That's awful. The explanation was just ""suddenly passed away""...."
2015-06-25‎@JordanAdequate I wouldn't go that far lol a lot of things will be answered in the new episode. Just a matter of finishing the fuckin thing.
2015-06-25‎@woahbo Welcome to my world.
2015-06-25‎@JordanAdequate Sounds like you and I are very similar lol
2015-06-25‎What could be being said? https://t.co/ba6Fuun4gU

2015-06-24‎@lotsoflogos lol the skeleton is pretty much all cut, it's just animated stuff that needs to be made. There's like 15 shots left.
2015-06-24‎Love one another, no matter how awful someone may seem. We're all just people searching for ourselves in an endless universe.
2015-06-24‎@imatu777 For some reason the PAL version was much crisper quality-wise. Idk if it'll be NTSC but if so I'd buy it.
2015-06-24‎@imatu777 haha the very first mention in the thread is about the shaky wobbly quality. If they can somehow stabilize that it'd be a miracle.
2015-06-23‎We're drawing very close to the new episode my friends. It will be out in July. Are you ready for something crazy? http://t.co/GkDfpsyVmo

2015-06-23‎@woahbo Go ahead. Then go play in the road. You'll be totally fine.
2015-06-23‎@makemebad35 Real shame =(  The Titanic soundtrack in general is amazing. My Heart Will Go On always gives me goosebumps.
2015-06-23‎Sad to hear about James Horner. One of my favorite music composers. =( He was one of my main inspirations to make soundtracks.
2015-06-23‎@andrewcblank Better yet, cassette and vinyl.  ;D
2015-06-23‎@realhartman I love when you post behind the scenes stuff or pre-production stuff like this. So cool.  =)

2015-06-22‎To animating. I'm a fucking machine. I don't even care if people hate this thing. This is going to be a fucking amazing series coming from
2015-06-22‎End of 2013, to just making a darker styled comedy video for the hell of it (Amnesia Rape) to composing my own music, to making this series,
2015-06-22‎It's like there's nothing I can't do video-wise anymore. I can do it all. How..in god's name...I went from a YouTuber going nowhere at the

2015-06-22‎Holy shit...hollyy shit.....holy shit....
2015-06-22‎@imatu777 The internet surprises me every day...
2015-06-22‎How in the world could that be fake? haha Even though it broke off screen. He's clearly holding the pieces in his hands on screen.
2015-06-22‎Someone really just thought the video of makemebad35 breaking Mr. Wooden Alligator was fake or edited....It's UNCUT footage. Really? Lol
2015-06-22‎@lotsoflogos Really? That's pretty crazy man. My first channel was like yours but it got shut down from copyright violations. Be careful.
2015-06-22‎@lotsoflogos It's like robbing somebody. I never just download someone else's video and upload it as my own. That's not right.
2015-06-22‎@lotsoflogos Sorry man. I thought it was just common knowledge. I know a lot of people do it with bigger YouTuber's stuff which sucks.
2015-06-22‎@sr_Aronn I thought you'd have at least 100 by now =(

2015-06-22‎@imatu777 If your twisted heart desires.
2015-06-22‎I'll probably make a video talking about this soon.
2015-06-22‎I know it's the Internet and anyone can do it but these are serious videos that take months and months to produce.
2015-06-22‎Things will be watermarked and copyrighted. Just want to give a heads up on this before it happens with these new videos.
2015-06-22‎Everything here on out is going to be different. All of the music has even been mostly composed by me from Extinxtion - Absolution.
2015-06-22‎Edits of my videos are perfectly fine. I approve of those but not if you start combing episodes into one or re-uploading them as a whole.
2015-06-22‎I work so hard to make the best possible content and if you start re-posting it, it could get flagged, especially if you have ads on it.
2015-06-22‎Videos made completely from scratch all on my own, it's going to look as if you're stealing my content and passing it off as your own.
2015-06-22‎Videos, Intro Sequences, etc). It's coming down to a matter of copyright with this NEW stuff. Being these are going to be fully animated
2015-06-22‎Episodes into one, I'm going to have to ask you to remove it. Some of my viewers have done this with things I've made (Anthology, Making Of
2015-06-22‎One thing I want viewers out there to know before it starts happening with the newer EGS episodes. If you re-upload an episode or combine
2015-06-21‎@lotsoflogos Re-post videos I've made but this animated stuff is a different story. This stuff takes months to make.
2015-06-21‎@lotsoflogos It's alright man lol I'd never do that unless you had ads on it. Things are changing here on out. I don't really care if people

2015-06-21‎@lotsoflogos It's still on my channel, just privatized.
2015-06-21‎@lotsoflogos Also being that is all technically copyrighted. The track, the animation, so in reality you're stealing it.
2015-06-21‎@lotsoflogos lol why? I'm going to eventually re-post this stuff.
2015-06-21‎@Nikaru9 It'll be replayed forever so I want it to be perfect lol don't want regrets with videos here on out.
2015-06-21‎RT @Nikaru9: @PioneersProd dedication and motivation is the key to true happiness. Just imagine how Relieved you will be once its done. :P
2015-06-21‎You have no idea how dedicated I am to bringing this thing to life the right way. Idk how my mind hasn't broke yet.
2015-06-21‎And remake EVERY arm and hand for EVERY character. I..am a fucking moron....
2015-06-21‎Any sane person would've jumped out their window by now if they had to do what I just did for this episode. I had to go back to EVERY shot
2015-06-21‎@Chocolateiplier I can't just ignore people. They matter.All of my viewers matter. I don't hold grudges to ones I had bad ties with anymore.
2015-06-21‎@Chocolateiplier As this fanbase has grown bigger, I've tried harder to please everyone. It backfires sometimes.
2015-06-21‎@Chocolateiplier Are just inevitable. They happen for a reason. I'm just one guy  =/  I have faults. We all do.
2015-06-21‎@Chocolateiplier Well I'm sorry  =(  Everyone has a limit in their minds. The last thing I ever want is to upset people. Some things
2015-06-21‎@Chocolateiplier I just don't understand. Idk if this is also for attention or what but I can't deal with it anymore.
2015-06-21‎@Chocolateiplier Understand what it is you're going through. And in every instance I always am labeled as the douche in this shit because
2015-06-21‎@Chocolateiplier If I were to learn one of my biggest supporters took their own life, I'd be mentally destroyed.
2015-06-21‎@Chocolateiplier I typed it fast alright? I shouldn't have said it to begin with. I'm just saying, I can't take those dark moments anymore.
2015-06-21‎@Chocolateiplier I try to be as nice as possible to this fanbase and then the instant I say something the slightest off, it's world's end.
2015-06-21‎"@Chocolateiplier I don't have time for the ""he said"" ""she said"" crap. I never said anything to tarnish anything."
2015-06-21‎@Chocolateiplier Look, I don't know what the big deal in all of this is. If you hate me, you hate me. I've never done anything to you dude.
2015-06-21‎@Chocolateiplier As if you don't talk about me behind my back. ~_~
2015-06-21‎Cherish the family, friends, and possessions you have. You might not know what you have until it's gone.

2015-06-20‎For me it was one of those you never forget where you were moments.
2015-06-20‎I can't believe it's already been 4 years since Ryan Dunn passed away. I met a guy who was in the same bar as him the night he died. Crazy.

2015-06-19‎Each year has just gotten bigger and better from a video standpoint. Having support from viewers who enjoy my stuff is all I've ever wanted.
2015-06-19‎I used to literally just walk around the house with a camera and act like I was in a movie. Now it's like I'm making my own mini ones.
2015-06-19‎I never would've thought I'd be as skilled as I am making videos. I'm no professional but just what I can do compared to then...it's crazy.
2015-06-19‎Sometimes I just stop and think, there was a time back between 2003 and 2008 that I didn't even know what I was capable of.
2015-06-19‎This series has been by no means perfect but I'm shocked at what I've been able to create; not just this series but the past 7 years.
2015-06-19‎I want to cry right now...these aren't tears of sadness, but tears of accomplishment.

2015-06-18‎That is going to be insane. It's going to be 20+ mins long...that's a shit ton of files. My Mac is a beast.
2015-06-18‎I want to know how many individual .MOV files I'll have by the time this episode's finished. Remember, EVERY single shot is ONE .MOV file.
2015-06-18‎@andrewcblank Those 9 words changed my life haha Little did I know that would be the start of something amazing.

2015-06-18‎My back up drive died. I just had to buy a fourth TB drive. What do you want from me computer God??

2015-06-18‎@Chocolateiplier You'd probably asphyxiate me before I could hug back...
2015-06-18‎@Chocolateiplier I'd like to be hugged please...
2015-06-17‎I just wish these didn't take so long to make. Not even done with one episode and have ideas for like 5 more.
2015-06-17‎My mind needs to slam on the brakes, jeez. I can't stop getting new ideas haha this is crazy.

2015-06-17‎@freakshow180 Turn on ABC and you'll relive some Cleveland memories. I can't believe we were like fourth row from the top of the arena.
2015-06-17‎I didn't even write this line. It was spur of the moment improv. I just animated most of it and can't stop laughing.
2015-06-17‎Hahahaha! Oh my god. I want this fucking line on a shirt after this video is out. Someone needs to make it happen. This is gold.

2015-06-16‎@black_veil_babe I'm working on a huge one right now that's probably one of the funniest I've made. Send Request is in it too lol
2015-06-16‎RT @black_veil_babe: @PioneersProd dude I'm watching stuff on your YouTube channel. I didn't know how hilarious some of your videos were 😂
2015-06-16‎I love you Flash..but man..you are one stupid program sometimes...
2015-06-16‎I swear to god I went to heaven and back in my dream last night..that was crazy.

2015-06-16‎Sorry I was talking to my mind through tweets. I'm sane.

2015-06-15‎@makemebad35 You'd like Asylum or Murder House. Way better story lines. Coven has a lot of plot holes. It's an amazing series though.
2015-06-15‎@Nikaru9 Although this is waayyy different compared to Vine stuff lol
2015-06-15‎@Nikaru9 For EGS I usually have an idea quick and then try to build around it for a couple weeks. Getting the idea is usually easiest now.
2015-06-15‎@Nikaru9 Never even happened. I had one or two failed ideas before that one that were somewhat filmed but got scrapped.Funny how it happens.
2015-06-15‎@Nikaru9 Back in 2008 I improvised everything and did like a video a week. Over the years it just happens at pure random. Extinction almost
2015-06-15‎@lotsoflogos Really? That'd be pretty awesome actually haha
2015-06-15‎@Nikaru9 haha that was a video that almost didn't get made. I didn't think I'd have enough to work with in a hot tub. Glad I made it.
2015-06-15‎@lotsoflogos Major reason why I stopped making those. People to this day still want them back though.
2015-06-15‎@lotsoflogos Started it all though so I can't take credit for coming up with my series. I mainly did it to hit stuff he didn't do yet.
2015-06-15‎"@lotsoflogos Lol there were plenty of other videos out there called ""You Know What Sucks"" when I started doing them. AVGN was the one who"
2015-06-15‎@makemebad35 Whenever American Horror Story ends I feel the same way.  =(  Although Freakshow kind of disappointed me.
2015-06-15‎@Nikaru9 I'll never forget filming that at 2am two summers ago. Fun to make but I have no idea how I didn't wake anyone up. XD

2015-06-14‎@Nighty74 @imatu777 I'm more of a woman than he will ever be.
2015-06-14‎This will be for future episodes, not this one coming up. A microphone is preferred but decent camera mic's are fine.
2015-06-14‎If there are any girl viewers out there that would be interested in voicing a character for the EGS series, let me know. I have 2 openings.
2015-06-14‎Words cannot describe how much I despise mornings.
2015-06-14‎I really feel like making a horror video right now. Time to start planning for Halloween then! lol

2015-06-13‎@Nighty74 Will take like two months to do one episode. That's the downside to animation. It takes forever. I am getting faster at it though.
2015-06-13‎@Nighty74 By time this is done I'll have to start a Halloween episode lol I plan on making them about 4 mins long after this. Even still, it
2015-06-13‎June 21 will mark the 5 month mark of production on this thing. That is ridiculous.
2015-06-13‎Something you'd see on TV. I just don't have the time right now to put all of my time into it. We're getting there though! It's 85% done.
2015-06-13‎It's looking like it's going to be 25 minutes long. So in reality it's two videos thrown into one, which I've never done before. It's like
2015-06-13‎This is without a doubt a project designed for at least 3 people to be working on, and being I'm a one man crew, it's insanity.
2015-06-13‎I keep getting bigger and better ideas that are improving the video. Not to mention having to go back and completely re-animate some stuff.
2015-06-13‎Hey guys, so unfortunately this video is going to keep getting pushed further into July. I'm really sorry this is taking so long to finish.
2015-06-13‎@FNC Be honest, if you had to assist George you'd wanna hang up on him too. XD

2015-06-12‎@andrewcblank Oh my god lmao
2015-06-12‎@andrewcblank I think that's on Watch Mojo's Top 10 Most Hated Songs list haha
2015-06-12‎@lotsoflogos I'll end up re-posting the deleted stuff on the Anthology channel after everything is all said and done.
2015-06-12‎@lotsoflogos This episode has undergone at least 100+ changes lol it's insanity. So I always remove things that aren't relevant.
2015-06-12‎@lotsoflogos There's a HUGE difference in the finished one because it was completely remade in Flash instead of Photoshop.
2015-06-12‎@lotsoflogos That was an unfinished preview version. I'll release the official one after the episode premiers. It's still up, just private.
2015-06-12‎Funny to think that back then was when I was starting to develop as a YouTuber. I miss those days sometimes.
2015-06-12‎Oh my god, I just watched some 5 year old makemebad35 videos and laughed like I haven't laughed in years.

2015-06-09‎@imatu777 For something I recorded yes lol but this is something someone else recorded. It tops everything in my previous collabs.
2015-06-09‎There's quite a few improv moments in this thing. Can't wait for you all to see it. Also, the stream will be starting in 45 mins  ;D
2015-06-09‎And would you believe that I didn't even write it? Improv is a wonderful thing sometimes.
2015-06-09‎Oh my god..I just received a voice over for the episode with a line that's going to go down as one of the greatest lines in my videos...

2015-06-09‎".@andrewcblank is going to be shocked when he sees what I did to ""Comeback Song"" for the Season 02 intro. It's pretty fricken awesome."
2015-06-08‎As I said, if anyone at all is ever interested in voice acting, let me know! Although this series is far from anything remotely sane.
2015-06-08‎Opportunities and options. It's like a giant toy box of everything you could want as a creator. I never would've thought I'd animate, ever.
2015-06-08‎What's amazing about this series from here on out is I can make episodes that aren't solely based on my character. This thing has endless
2015-06-08‎I never would've thought back in January I'd make something quite like this. It might get pushed into July but it's definitely worth it.
2015-06-08‎But so many things keep happening that improves the video. I'm trying to make this thing as top notch as my skills will allow.
2015-06-08‎I honestly can't believe what I'm making. This thing literally shatters my old videos into a million tiny pieces. Trying to have a deadline.
2015-06-08‎=)
2015-06-08‎@freakshow180 It's on Tuesday lol
2015-06-07‎Look guys, I'm a plushie! Thanks for making this @Nikaru9  :D  @Queeen_Sammyy is the one holding me hahaha http://t.co/1OTu0linAI
2015-06-07‎@imatu777 They will be much harder than that lol I actually don't like being drunk to be honest.
2015-06-07‎This will NOT be a drunk stream by the way. Sorry to get your hopes up. =P
2015-06-07‎Some lucky souls will have a chance to make me chug some beer by answering some PioneersProductions trivia.Stream will be 7:30pm ET - 12:30.
2015-06-07‎Remember there will be a Live stream on Tuesday evening for the 7 year anniversary of PioneersProductions. There will be music and beer.
2015-06-07‎@imatu777 I did that twice and never did it again. I don't know if I still have it lol last time I did was like two years ago.
2015-06-07‎Scientists need to invent a way to record dreams while you sleep. I'll pay handsomely.
2015-06-07‎@markiplier I don't think I've ever laughed so hard at one of your videos like this one before. XD
2015-06-06‎@makemebad35 lmao, the other night I was wondering how weird the time change would feel for you.

2015-06-06‎@andrewcblank Haha oh jeez. You'll be pretty blown away by it. It's really out there. If you and Derek thought my old stuff was crazy XD
2015-06-06‎@andrewcblank Can't wait, man! The sooner the better, if it isn't too much trouble. I should have this thing done in 2 weeks or so.

2015-06-05‎@FNC Yesss! Be afraid, Jared....be very...afraid...
2015-06-05‎@imatu777 A second one would tarnish the legacy of the first one. *quickly tries to think of lame excuses to prevent a sequel*
2015-06-05‎@imatu777 That video needs to be locked away for eternity without any possible way of opening it up.
2015-06-05‎@nONNELreggaJ After this new huge video is out they will be much smaller scaled so they won't take months to do. I'm really excited.  :D
2015-06-05‎I really honestly thought that 2015 would bury PioneersProductions and everything would be over. I haven't had ideas like this in 6 years.
2015-06-05‎Oh my gosh, I'm getting video ideas like I'm 16 again.
2015-06-05‎Anyone out there know a good website for starting internet petitions? I've never made one before.

2015-06-04‎I talk to myself more than I talk to people x100.
2015-06-03‎@Nighty74 Yeah that wasn't fun to put up with. I've only been in the new school once to pick up the lock-in DVD.

2015-06-01‎One guy doing this entire thing on his own is suicide, which is what I've done. Hope this thing leaves a lasting impression on this fanbase.
2015-06-01‎I can't wait to put this out and I know you can't wait for me to finally shut up about the production haha It is a HUGE production.
2015-06-01‎This is like 4 videos thrown into one. I'll never go this abstract again. It's grueling.
2015-06-01‎Also trying to keep the vision fresh from back then. Can't imagine working on a movie or a tv series. This has had me thinking like crazy.
2015-06-01‎What's been the weirdest out of all of this is animating and editing stuff now that wrote 2+ months ago. It's like working backwards.

2015-05-31‎@freakshow180 Oh man. I remember we actually filmed something where we shot Bottled Water but that got lost somehow I think?

2015-05-27‎Literally almost every shot had to be taken into account for. In the end all that matters is the finished product. I went far with this one.
2015-05-27‎When it's out, if you really just sit and try to break it down production-wise, you'll see why this has taken months to do and figure out.
2015-05-27‎I know I've mentioned the making of this episode a million times but it's literally what I've lived and breathed for 4 months haha
2015-05-27‎Only other video that comes close is Alligator/Horse Head 2. If you really wanna be technical, that was like 9 months in the making.
2015-05-27‎This one is so unbelievably complicated compared to what I normally do. It's almost done though.
2015-05-27‎I more than doubled that. I've never worked on a video for so long before. I want it the hell finished already lol
2015-05-27‎I can't believe I'm still filming shots for this episode. I broke my all-time record (Figure In Black spanned for 2 months).
2015-05-26‎@imatu777 lol thanks, I guess?
2015-05-26‎@lotsoflogos Oh trust me, I know how tough the industry is. YouTube is a grain of sand compared to film.
2015-05-26‎Final teaser for the episode. So much has changed in the past 4 months that the old teasers were scrapped. - https://t.co/IzVpvoKseO
2015-05-26‎Even if the animation isn't crazy good, I think you'll be really surprised with this one. This has been like making a short film.
2015-05-26‎Only one scene left to animate and lastly, music. So we're getting there folks!
2015-05-26‎Once this one's out it'll be easy street. This was literally like starting over completely from scratch. It's been a process.
2015-05-26‎When you see the episode it'll look like it took me half that. I've never had a video change as drastic as this one has. It's insane.
2015-05-26‎I can't believe I've been working on this episode for FOUR MONTHS...When I do behind the scenes I'll have to show you how different it was.
2015-05-26‎@totalIyburnham Just reminds me too much of Markiplier. I can't listen to him for too long. He's a good YouTuber though, I can't fault him.
2015-05-26‎@totalIyburnham Jack's great lol I got quite a few responses from him. I don't watch him anymore though.
2015-05-25‎@imatu777 I only did that one time. I have friends that claim I did it more than once for some reason.

2015-05-25‎It was as if reality added a cheat code. I'm dumb.
2015-05-25‎Hahahaha the funniest part out of all of this was it took me like 10 seconds to even realize what happened.
2015-05-25‎I think I broke the dog gate. You have got to be kidding me.
2015-05-25‎That was one of the funniest fucking things that's ever happened to me. Idk how I'm not even hurt. That was hilarious.
2015-05-25‎Idk how I didn't just break my neck. Don't drink kids.

2015-05-23‎Well I just had a blonde moment times ten.
2015-05-23‎My hot tub is literally my think hole lol So many video ideas have spawned from that.
2015-05-23‎Midnight fact, I got the idea for this huge video while sitting in my hot tub, after watching the season finale of AHS: Freakshow.

2015-05-23‎What's up Twitter world?
2015-05-22‎@DustyTymes We all make videos we regret lol it was 4 1/2 years ago so I don't think much of it.
2015-05-22‎@JordanAdequate Sounds like somebody's having a rough night haha
2015-05-22‎@imatu777 lol that was a day after I smoked pot for the first time.
2015-05-22‎It's a lengthy video but this is a good blend of material. I'm really trying to get this finished but putting the charm and care into it.
2015-05-22‎It's only 65% done but I think we have a contender for the funniest video in PioneersProductions history.
2015-05-22‎@imatu777 @Queeen_Sammyy I don't care if it had the declaration of independence engraved in it with cheese, I'd eat that shit.
2015-05-22‎@Queeen_Sammyy @imatu777 Put some barbeque sauce or buffalo sauce on any chicken nugget and I'll eat that shit.

2015-05-22‎@imatu777 That's from the second movie (Rainbow Rocks). That's what hooked me on MLP. Saw that before the series back in February.

2015-05-20‎May 20th, Randy perfected the act of making an animated character blink. And life was good...life was good on the mountain in Pennsylvania.
2015-05-20‎@imatu777 Actually the second half is a flashback lol But it transitions better with the first half rather than its own episode.
2015-05-20‎Consider it a double feature.
2015-05-20‎I'm a moron. If I didn't work on animating the second half of this episode first I could've split it into two episodes. Would be out sooner.
2015-05-20‎@thesquirrel1000 Just looking at the word gives me a headache...
2015-05-20‎@freakshow180 Lmfao. Start 'em young, folks.
2015-05-20‎@imatu777 I just realized one of my new characters has a voice similar to that guy haha but it was before I heard that part of the track.
2015-05-20‎@imatu777 That's messed up lol
2015-05-20‎RT @imatu777: @PioneersProd dude, i was just listening to that part! lol
2015-05-20‎@makemebad35 It looked pretty similar to Final Cut. Not sure if you ever upgraded to Final Cut Pro X. Like X way better than 7. Simpler.

2015-05-19‎@imatu777 It's different I'll say that. It's not like anything I've written before so it's like starting over. Has the Pioneer feel though.
2015-05-19‎@imatu777 It'd be tough to make action sequences. That's out of my skill range. This is just basic material for now. Who knows!
2015-05-19‎@imatu777 I already have her back story written and animated lol

2015-05-17‎@Queeen_Sammyy It'll look though. Probably cheesy looking but it'll be awesome to see.
2015-05-17‎"@Queeen_Sammyy You can do it on websites like Custom Ink or Uberprints. That's where we made our ""Fatass"" shirts lol I have no idea how"

2015-05-17‎@Nighty74 haha I finally got the perspective right. It's so tricky getting a 2D model submerged into a shot when they're not even there.
2015-05-17‎@Nikaru9 Lmao, you're pretty good at that!
2015-05-17‎"Hobo, ""You use MLP as a reference for animating?..I feel like I've taught you nothing.."""
2015-05-17‎@imatu777 I don't have 6ft tall props lol Usually luck out with shots like that and dont have to adjust much. This was hell for some reason.
2015-05-17‎@imatu777 Lighting, framing, and objects have been messing up the shot. It's tricky because it's a scene with two characters.
2015-05-17‎@imatu777 Actually for one section in this episode, yes. They come in handy. This shot is just a corner of the room lol
2015-05-17‎I've never re-shot a scene so many times like that before. It didn't used to be an empty shot b/c I was originally in it. But my god..
2015-05-17‎I've been working on getting these series of shots right since February 12th....let that sink in.  X(  Things changed in the script a lot.
2015-05-17‎This is at least the TENTH time I've reshot this fucking shot. It's so tricky to get the perspective right for shit that's not even there.
2015-05-17‎I never would've thought that the toughest shot in the entire episode would be one where I literally just let the camera sit and do nothing.
2015-05-16‎@lotsoflogos Wtf lol
2015-05-16‎We're getting there though! I'm hoping to have the first episode out late June.
2015-05-16‎After this, it's all animation, all the time. If I were to keep them over 10 mins, I'd be working on the 2nd one until Halloween lol
2015-05-16‎I'm leaning more towards 5 minutes. I've had leniency with this first one being it's a combo of video and animation.
2015-05-16‎After the first episode of Season 2 is out I'll be condensing them down to 4-8 mins in length. This one has reasons for being 10-15 mins.
2015-05-16‎@SimpsonsQOTD Bahaha, I forgot about this one. XD

2015-05-06‎While still not perfect or Disney quality, it's pretty amazing considering I've never animated anything before.
2015-05-06‎After months of experimenting I can say that I've really gotten a feel for animation. Stuff in that original teaser was so stiff.

2015-04-24‎But looking back on old vlogs and videos like this, it's crazy how much you change. This video is almost 5 years old.
2015-04-24‎I'll always prefer my content from late 2012 to the present than the old days just because of how much more presentable they are.
2015-04-24‎I kind of miss those days (2010 - 2012). I pumped out videos left and right. Then 2013 was when everything changed.
2015-04-24‎This is from that period where I was still partly a kid but maturing. A weird period in my YouTube career but when I became really vocal.

2015-04-23‎@Sheboss_Jessy34 Take a victory nap. @freakshow180 specializes in those.
2015-04-23‎@Nikaru9 haha that's so cute. Beagles are adorable. Dogs in general are adorable.

2015-04-23‎@freakshow180 That's a shame. He had to be on some hardcore shit to make those videos.
2015-04-23‎@freakshow180 I still can't stop laughing at those Dilbert videos XD
2015-04-23‎Curtain Call series has a completely reconstructed version of the intro. It makes the old one look like a joke. Stuff moves, not just pics.
2015-04-23‎Freaky huh? I still want to do a video talking about the track and how it's become the face of my videos nowadays.
2015-04-23‎"Perfect the words fit both me and my videos (and what would eventually be the ""Pentalogy"" videos). So I unknowingly picked the perfect song."
2015-04-23‎Perfectly spread apart for the images to zoom into the camera lens. Then the more I listened to the track, the more I realized how eerily

2015-04-22‎I had dreamception last night. I dreamed that I had a dream and then later on was awake and talked about the dream I dreamt.Then I was dead.
2015-04-22‎@Nighty74 I often don't. See what I did there?  XD
2015-04-22‎I don't know how I can listen to the same exact song or two on repeat for hours.
2015-04-22‎@imatu777 It did that to me before! I don't know, man. Twitter glitches for me more than anything.
2015-04-22‎@MuscleRyan @imatu777 I guess Twitter glitched. The only thing I was sensitive about was a fan fic I read.
2015-04-22‎@freakshow180 How do you find this shit? Lol that's so weird. I'll never think of ranch or cool ranch the way again.
2015-04-22‎@imatu777 I don't do ponies.
2015-04-22‎@Nikaru9 Sonata from Rainbow Rocks is my favorite in general but she's not in the series. X(
2015-04-22‎@Nikaru9 It's hard to pick. It's a tie between Rarity, Fluttershy, and Twilight.

2015-04-21‎Well I had a video uploading but YouTube froze it halfway through. Thanks YouTube X(
2015-04-21‎"This will make it easier to make. I didn't post the ""end"" video yesterday but it still will be the last thing I make."
2015-04-21‎So I got an idea. Instead of making this into a movie, why not split it into a series? It doesn't have to be 5 parts or anything.
2015-04-21‎I just need to not push myself as hard. I try so hard every day to stay fresh and make things perfect. Sometimes I hit a low.
2015-04-21‎I'm really sorry about all of this mess today. I'm not in the greatest state of mind right now. There's so much I'm trying to process.
2015-04-21‎@DustyTymes Going to try my best, man. I've really been a roller coaster lately. I'll be alright. Just need to not push myself as hard.
2015-04-21‎@Lanier3000 If you have a bad day there's always tomorrow. =)
2015-04-21‎@Lanier3000 I just need to not push myself as hard. It plays on my emotions. I really hit a low today. But that's how life is sometimes.
2015-04-21‎Well today was interesting...good night my friends.
2015-04-21‎I'm still going to try and make it a point to somehow get this movie made. Even if it's not what I expected. I'm going to try.
2015-04-21‎@MuscleRyan Ryan, after all these years I don't even know what you look like. I don't have anyone added on the personal FB. It's a decoy.
2015-04-20‎"@freakshow180 My cat's name is ""Kitty"". It'd make sense lol but I hate just calling a pet what it is. Need to name her."
2015-04-20‎@MuscleRyan I unfriended everybody because I made a Facebook page instead. It's still the same link - https://t.co/8MngiVWToe
2015-04-20‎I thought Martha was a better choice but Ginger it is lol
2015-04-20‎Trying to find something happy to tweet to clear the air here. Here's Ginger. I guess we all settled on that name. http://t.co/ncNKtfymRU
2015-04-20‎Nothing makes me smile more than a snoring dog in my arms that we adopted from the SPCA. =)
2015-04-19‎I never thought I'd ever have a cat. I never thought I'd ever have both a cat and a dog at the same time lol gonna be a weird few weeks.
2015-04-19‎Sneakily poking her head around corners looking for the dog. Constantly looking behind her. Watching from above. This is gonna take a while.
2015-04-19‎"The dog likes the cat, the cat's just giving the look like ""when..is..she..LEAVING??"" She's all ninja around the house right now lol"
2015-04-18‎Hopefully this will help make up for not putting content out since January =) Working on this movie and all, I feel bad not making anything.
2015-04-18‎Hopefully it will be released next week but it's not set in stone. It'll be worth the wait, I promise :D  That's how production goes.
2015-04-18‎For those asking we expected the music video to be released yesterday but unfortunately theres some minor issues going on behind the scenes.
2015-04-18‎RT @andrewcblank: Do what defines you. Not what you want others to perceive you as.
2015-04-18‎@lotsoflogos We all planned on it getting released today but the date got changed. I don't know what's going on.
2015-04-18‎@PleasantBo That's horrifying...
2015-04-17‎I almost forgot what it's like to have a dog around. I've missed it like you wouldn't believe. She's a cutie.
2015-04-17‎The dog is from a rescue center and is 4 1/2 years old. Very friendly. Going to be a crazy week getting her and the cat used to each other.

2015-04-17‎I love you guys. &lt;3
2015-04-16‎I think God got lazy with my mind and just grabbed a handful of traits from the pile without looking. It would explain my bizarre interests.
2015-04-16‎The Send Request music video could be released tomorrow. :D  I'll keep you posted.
2015-04-16‎@makemebad35 Happy YouTube anniversary! Nine years is insane. Idk why but I always remembered the date lol
2015-04-16‎@thatcoolguy55 But at the end of the day I've made people laugh. That's all that really matters to me. Even if some videos aren't good.
2015-04-16‎@thatcoolguy55 I've had plenty of those moments, man. After almost 7 years, it's hard for me to look back on older stuff.
2015-04-16‎@freakshow180 Ah yes, the good ol' mall that we spent 12 hours in. X(
2015-04-16‎"@makemebad35 I need to figure out how to mute posts that have ""tacos"" in it...."

2015-04-15‎@DesterysPizza I just don't like cats. Not my thing.
2015-04-15‎@thatcoolguy55 That's awesome! Haha
2015-04-15‎@thatcoolguy55 Doing voice overs, making the music from scratch, directing other voice actresses. Doing graphics. It's insane. Going well.
2015-04-15‎@thatcoolguy55 It's very different than your average YouTube video. I have to divide myself into different areas. Scripting, animating
2015-04-15‎@thatcoolguy55 I don't remember lol If it were something quick I'd be able to get it done. Now's the worst time because I'm doing a movie.
2015-04-15‎@thatcoolguy55 Good to see people still enjoy them though =)
2015-04-15‎@thatcoolguy55 I'd be able to make them much more fluent nowadays but they're copying James. I've been really original the last two years.
2015-04-14‎I don't like most of these videos but I've been asked frequently to re-upload them. Mainly because they're ripoffs.

2015-04-14‎@imatu777 A guy I play Xbox with has been pressuring me for the last two years to watch it.
2015-04-14‎Everyone has a purpose. Sometimes it isn't visible right away.
2015-04-14‎@davegs960 Go ahead. You'll feel better.
2015-04-14‎@PierceTheSxmmy lol I should just make a recreated one as an alternate. I'm serious about making those into posters lol they'd look cool.
2015-04-14‎"@PierceTheSxmmy Just the ""Resurrection"" Ember model needs to be replaced. I'm still shaky looking back on that lol it's so cheesy looking."
2015-04-14‎@PierceTheSxmmy I really want to make those pentalogy thumbnails into prints some day. They'd make great posters if I touch them up a bit.
2015-04-13‎We're drawing very close to the music video release. =)  I guarantee the track will be stuck in your head for a while. It's catchy.

2015-04-13‎@PierceTheSxmmy I will sometime after the music video is out. I need to work on this movie.
2015-04-13‎What makes this movie so fun is that there's a variety of different voice actresses/actors. I can't wait to make this thing come to life.
2015-04-13‎The first scene script has been sent. Oh boy..It's really happening... #CurtainCall
2015-04-12‎Everyone is destined to leave behind an art with achievable recognition.

2015-04-12‎@freakshow180 Whatever happened to Tommy Dixon? I guess he never got to be more popular than Fred.
2015-04-12‎@lotsoflogos I had the same one for two years. Needed to improve it.
2015-04-12‎@Nikaru9 I hope he had it coming.

2015-04-10‎@imatu777 Hey if you're up for it I could use you as an extra. I need as many voice actors as I can get. Script isn't finished yet though.
2015-04-10‎Aghh! Think mind..think...What I mean is I can't figure out what voice to use or who to cast for this character.

2015-04-04‎@GLITCHIPLlER You're not having luck with spiders are you? haha
2015-04-04‎@lotsoflogos I'll try it on one of my PCs. It sucks because once you burn a DVD you can't re-use it.
2015-04-04‎This is for animation portions, so it's just voice overs.
2015-04-04‎For Curtain Call. It is literally going to be a movie so I need as many people as I can get. If you're interested in general, let me know!
2015-04-04‎Viewers out there! You might get a message from me in the near future asking if you'd be interested in doing a voice over line or two
2015-04-04‎Only problem is every technique I've tried has failed. I'll try to research it but the software's I've used won't play it in DVD players.
2015-04-04‎This is a MAJOR production. I can't stress that enough. I might even try to get it released as a DVD for a limited quantity.
2015-04-04‎Not that it'll be the end all be all, but I'm just going to work on getting this done and nothing else. It'll definitely be worth it.
2015-04-04‎The thing is, I don't have any intentions of making new content in the meantime, or for a period afterwords. So this is literally a movie.
2015-04-04‎I really don't like saying this but this video is going to take FOREVER to do. I wanted it done by June, it might take a lot longer.
2015-04-04‎Haha wow, so Curtain Call is going to have some new faces as well as new voices. I have possibly two to three new voice actors for this.
2015-04-03‎My brother also did the Derek shot.
2015-04-03‎What do you guys think of the music video teaser? All of those shots were mine except the overhead of the band and the ref shot.

2015-04-03‎This is going to be interesting. I get to sit back and listen to Mallorie do voices for a half hour for Curtain Call.
2015-04-02‎@imatu777 Hey, happy birthday man! :D
2015-04-02‎When you've listened to a song for a year and hear something that you've never noticed before. http://t.co/f6m2CFgGSp
2015-04-02‎@GLITCHIPLlER That's terrifying 0_0
2015-04-02‎@GLITCHIPLlER I don't know why but I really wanna kill that thing with fire.
2015-04-02‎Also huge thanks to @freakshow180 and @makemebad35 for giving their two cents and improving the video even more! :D  You're awesome.
2015-04-02‎I love you guys so much. You are one of the reasons why I even had a chance to do this music video. I think you'll be blown away by it.
2015-04-02‎This is the happiest I've felt in quite a while. There's no better feeling than when something big is finished.
2015-04-02‎I think it's officially done. I'll stop teasing you all with these tweets now lol It really looks like a legit music video..well..b/c it is!
2015-04-02‎I never thought makemebad35 would make a life saving edit in this music video haha god, so many subtle things that can always be improved.
2015-04-01‎Just when you think it's done.......it's..still...not...DONE....
2015-04-01‎This feels so surreal. I've watched this music video at least 200 times and I still can't believe I helped make this. It doesn't feel real.
2015-04-01‎It's done! This music video is one of the greatest things that I've ever helped work on. Can't wait for you guys to see it.  :D
2015-04-01‎Ladies and gentlemen..it's nearly 5 am but I think we have ourselves a finished cut of the music video. :D
2015-04-01‎Man, @freakshow180 is a life saver. He just found some mistakes in this music video that I didn't even catch. Thanks, James! :D
2015-04-01‎@PierceTheSxmmy I get surgery on Friday X(
2015-03-31‎Mike, Kris, and everyone else who was a part of that production, you're awesome! I never thought it'd go this far.
2015-03-31‎It also obviously helped lead to the music video shoot on Saturday. Here I was just a college student doing his job to graduate.
2015-03-31‎Crazy to think that on this night a year ago my life changed for the better. This performance led to the EGS series. http://t.co/zWkZ2yuyS0
2015-03-31‎There will most likely be a teaser out this week for the music video. I'll keep you posted. :D
2015-03-31‎@PolishMovieZoe Who even drives a car like that? There's speakers on the roof blasting gospel music.
2015-03-31‎"""Start a new life with Jesus."" I'm dead...just...what??!"
2015-03-31‎Guys...you know how I just said my life was complete and I could die happy? I just walked outside and saw this... http://t.co/3kXQXixX5v
2015-03-31‎I can die happy now. My life is complete.
2015-03-31‎I literally just face palmed...it takes extreme stupidity to make me do this...you know who you are...  =P
2015-03-31‎@Jack_Septic_Eye I'm in the same boat, man. Although I can't make a living off of it. YouTube really has changed my life. Thanks to viewers.
2015-03-31‎@makemebad35 That's messed up man. I have no idea what you did but hope it get's sorted out. =(
2015-03-31‎@GLITCHIPLlER Yeah, go for it! :D
2015-03-31‎There's no deadline for this but let me know that the pic is specifically for the video.
2015-03-31‎You can tweet me the pic or private message me it on my Facebook page http://t.co/CWWsDN81eA
2015-03-30‎Take a picture of yourself in a supportive way or make an edit of yourself with something PioneersProductions related in it.
2015-03-30‎Hey guys so there's been a change in plans with the viewer's portion for Curtain Call. To make this easier, if you want to be in it
2015-03-30‎Here's a picture before filming started lol http://t.co/EeGffWI9Eu
2015-03-30‎@PierceTheSxmmy Alright, start walking. At this rate, I hope you like cold tacos.
2015-03-30‎I think a celebratory Taco Bell is in order.
2015-03-29‎Somehow the planets alined or something because I can't get solid pan shots for the life of me. I was clutch.
2015-03-29‎There's a pan shot in near the end of this music video that was dead solid fucking perfect. My tripod is the worst at pan shots.
2015-03-29‎Heh...hahahaha! You know the irony in all of this? You know how I was bitching the other week about how much I suck at and hate pan shots?
2015-03-29‎This is still at least a month away from getting released but I'm stunned at how well this turned out.
2015-03-29‎I can't thank Send Request enough for letting me and my brother do this. It was a blast. Also was amazing to meet them in person again.
2015-03-29‎Man this music video is amazing. It gives me chills. It's pretty much done. Just need to make some final adjustments. You guys will love it.
2015-03-29‎Just helped edit something amazing. I think you guys are really going to love this music video that I… https://t.co/g37K8hp5nj
2015-03-29‎It won't be released for another month or so but be sure to keep an eye out for updates. :D
2015-03-29‎I won't post any images from the shoot to keep it secret but the video is pretty much 90% done. It's pretty epic.
2015-03-29‎Haha wow, this video is ridiculous.
2015-03-28‎@lotsoflogos I love it! Although I have no idea what I'm saying throughout most of it haha

2015-03-28‎Had a fun day filming @SendRequestBand! Be on the lookout for their first music video, soon. :D
2015-03-28‎@PierceTheSxmmy Oh, boy. Shots wreck me quick. They can hit you out of nowhere. They're fun though. Haven't had liquor since New Year's.
2015-03-28‎Reason why this series even exists. Their new track is bangin'. Can't wait for you to hear it when it's out.
2015-03-28‎If you've seen Extinction, Resurrection, or Absolution then you've heard one of their tracks in the intro sequence. These guys are a huge

2015-03-26‎RT @lotsoflogos: @PioneersProd I want to see your reaction to this video :D http://t.co/7cN2ZQb1pt
2015-03-26‎As for right now, I'm focusing on the animation. Seeing something that was just an image actually move is insanely surreal.
2015-03-26‎You'd think I'd be mad but the truth is, it's going to be better than what I originally intended. This video goes through constant changes.
2015-03-26‎For weeks I planned out a scene that was originally the climax of the video. There were scenes before leading up to it that ALL got scrapped
2015-03-26‎"I spent an hour filming a car scene that isn't even going to be shown. I should start making a folder called ""The Lost Footage""."
2015-03-26‎@PierceTheSxmmy Yeah. Gonna be fun. We're actually shooting it at the same campus where I filmed them last year, just a different building.
2015-03-26‎Kind of in that mood where I want to get drunk and play Black Ops until sunrise. Me and Hobo did that until 5am the other night.
2015-03-26‎"Did you know the ""EGS"" and ""Anthology"" series all began over a song? Almost a year to the day. http://t.co/FuYYCG2mnp"
2015-03-25‎My mind right now. http://t.co/jDiMHy9Ldm
2015-03-25‎I have full confidence now in what I can create. This is going to be awesome when it's finished.
2015-03-25‎Hermagahd! Hermagahd! I animated a thingy! Sweet Christmas! It's so insanely awesome seeing something come to life.I love you Hobo! No homo.
2015-03-24‎@lotsoflogos You never truly leave YouTube.
2015-03-24‎@lotsoflogos Both, or at least for a good while. I talk about it in the video that's going up soon.
2015-03-24‎Hobo Deadfish is my fucking hero right now for animating. He may have just helped me avoid weeks of frustration.
2015-03-24‎Hey guys, if you enjoy hearing me talk uncut on camera for a period of time, expect a video later this evening.  =)
2015-03-24‎@lotsoflogos It's going to be the last for the series, unless for some crazy reason I do a sequel.
2015-03-24‎@AaronFuckingB That's actually really interesting.
2015-03-24‎@PierceTheSxmmy All of them will be on a wiki page with back stories included. There's going to be a whole wiki devoted to the EGS series.
2015-03-24‎@PierceTheSxmmy Well I can assure you her name is not Samantha. I think everyone will find these characters interesting.
2015-03-24‎@thatcoolguy55 We'll see what happens, man. If this video does insanely well, it might give me new ideas. As you said, it's never over. =)
2015-03-24‎@thatcoolguy55 Supposed to be fun. There isn't too much more I feel I need to prove or accomplish. But the channel is still there if need be
2015-03-24‎@thatcoolguy55 Anymore, I can do something as many as five times and not be satisfied; let alone for an entire short film. But it's all
2015-03-24‎@thatcoolguy55 It's mainly because I'm a perfectionist. It's killed my will to keep going. Each video since 2014 has gotten more advanced.
2015-03-24‎Heading in that direction. Anything can happen though.
2015-03-24‎I couldn't picture a better way of wrapping up a channel than like this. I don't want to flat out say that this will be the end, but it's
2015-03-24‎This very well could be the last video I ever make that's high production quality. Any sane person would've jumped out their window by now.
2015-03-24‎I should've kept an editing log for this video from the beginning. I'd probably be around 1500 hours by now.
2015-03-23‎"Me playing Black Ops II, ""I'm toast, I'm toast!"" *kills a guy* ""Oh never mind, I'm still white as bread."" Dumbest thing I've ever said."
2015-03-23‎I stayed up listening to Queen. When I was 17.

2015-03-23‎To think, all of this because of stabbing a rubber Frog. I literally put my blood and sweat into my YouTube videos for you guys...
2015-03-23‎This is all from filming Extinction back in July. My hand might never be the same again. Keep positive thoughts for me.
2015-03-23‎This happens to one in a hundred people. So there's little room for error. I haven't shown pics but there's a 4 inch scar on my hand.
2015-03-23‎The tendon's stuck on scar tissue and removing this could completely lacerate the tendon again, destroying everything the first surgery did.
2015-03-23‎It's still 12 days away but I need as much good luck as I can get. I'm getting surgery again on my hand but this time it's very risky.
2015-03-22‎@lotsoflogos So I need to be sure the script is set in stone before I gather recordings from everybody.
2015-03-22‎@lotsoflogos That's one of the last things I'm going to do. The story structure is insane in this one. Something changes almost daily.
2015-03-22‎Curtain Call is the eeriest video that I've ever worked on. Just when I think I'm drawing blanks, BOOM, something happens.
2015-03-22‎Man, I'm either insanely lucky with getting ideas for this video or things are all eerily happening for a reason at the perfect moments.
2015-03-22‎@PierceTheSxmmy Curtain Call is a mini YouTube movie. If this does well &amp; people want a sequel I'll kill them. It'll take me til Xmas lol
2015-03-22‎@PierceTheSxmmy There's plenty in Curtain Call. All have back stories as well. I have three written so far.
2015-03-22‎Today has been one of the strangest days of my life.
2015-03-22‎What the hell? A VCR that I've never seen before appeared on the kitchen table and the brand is the name of a new character I just made.

2015-03-22‎@lotsoflogos I love that he does charity events but besides that he's just a guy who plays videos games.
2015-03-22‎@lotsoflogos I respect fan girls but Mark's take things way too seriously sometimes. It drives me crazy. They make him out to be their god.
2015-03-22‎@lotsoflogos Everyone's making it out to be like he's on his death bed.
2015-03-22‎If you saw Send Request's SpongeBob medley video, they did it Live on the radio yesterday - https://t.co/4xh6Zhk520
2015-03-21‎@freakshow180 I even have manually manage music on. Something just bugged out.
2015-03-21‎@freakshow180 It doesn't make sense though. On my phone everything just vanished and reset to having purchased tracks. I don't get it.

2015-03-20‎@PierceTheSxmmy Did you listen?
2015-03-20‎You might have just witnessed some of the greatest 55 seconds in radio history. #SendRequestBand

2015-03-20‎@budd_weisser There was a period where I was really into it and that factored into the writing for Absolution. Haven't watched it in months.
2015-03-20‎Who would've thought? So many things factored into the making of the series;Send Request, Robbyn Kirmssé, Frozen, Rainbow Rocks, Scream, etc
2015-03-20‎"Did the ""Viewers"" section for the Anthology, I probably NEVER would've been working with her, let alone have the Pentalogy series."
2015-03-20‎She plays a HUGE role in Curtain Call. Voices, accents, singing, writing, you name it she can do it. It's crazy to think that if I never

2015-03-20‎@PierceTheSxmmy I'm just saying, if you thought my last few videos were shady, god knows how you'll take Curtain Call. There's even a Wiki.
2015-03-20‎@PierceTheSxmmy @GLITCHIPLlER I hate you guys too.  ~_~

2015-03-18‎@PierceTheSxmmy Too late, I looked.
2015-03-18‎@makemebad35 I never heard of it either. It's a beta tester app. They emailed the new version to the email I used for the Sleep Talk app.
2015-03-18‎@makemebad35 They actually just released a brand new version on Test Flight. I haven't said anything decent in months. Why'd you stop?!
2015-03-18‎Oh god, Taco Bell is trending...don't look at it..don't look at it...ahhhhh!
2015-03-18‎I think I've only done it one time before this, years ago.
2015-03-18‎I wish I'd known sooner how well tea and honey prevents your throat from shredding when recording stuff. What a difference, man.
2015-03-17‎There's two songs that I've been working on for Curtain Call but the first one's key was way too high. This one is actually really decent.
2015-03-17‎God dammit, I wrote something that's going to get stuck in your heads for days. Hahaha I've never written music before but my god.
2015-03-17‎Just open your mouth and close your eyes. It's raining tacos! It's raining tacos out in the street.

2015-03-17‎@PierceTheSxmmy But Sonata Dusk is one of the cutest villains ever! And it's Taco Tuesday. You can't separate our love. &gt;:(
2015-03-17‎@freakshow180 Oh yeah! I remember playing it a few times. That looks like it'd get addicting after a while.
2015-03-17‎That's my perfectionism talking lol I'm so picky when I film. It shows in my work but sometimes it's the subtlest thing.
2015-03-17‎Pan shots are the fucking devil with my tripod. They need to invent a tripod that moves at a precise speed on its own to prevent shakiness.
2015-03-17‎The pan shot; a method of moving the camera horizontally to the right or left..in other words, the ultimate way to piss Randy off filming.
2015-03-17‎RT @lotsoflogos: @PioneersProd I taped over Randy D:. at the best part too! Yes, it's on VHS. http://t.co/nEvxa0WIzt
2015-03-17‎@lotsoflogos hahaha that's priceless. It's like it's the censored version. Is that really on VHS??
2015-03-16‎I swear my Taco Bell addiction is returning...

2015-03-15‎@freakshow180 They never get old. Once in a while I get the urge to play Pokemon Red and then I don't touch it for 6 months. Then I go back.
2015-03-15‎How are you today ladies and gents?
2015-03-15‎@Nighty74 How the hell did you do that?
2015-03-15‎It's crazy. I literally got an idea for a scene last night and scored it that night. That never happens.
2015-03-15‎I take back my hatred for the new Garage Band. Used version 6 for years but 10 has great sound if you know what you're doing.
2015-03-15‎@PierceTheSxmmy =)
2015-03-15‎@PierceTheSxmmy Trash never sounded so good  &gt;:D
2015-03-15‎@PierceTheSxmmy Er..did I say that? I meant it's the absolute worst piece of trash that has ever had the luxury of passing through my ears.
2015-03-14‎For the opening for this series but it was just a basic edit. This one is insane. Graphics fly, move, come apart, flash, glow, you name it.
2015-03-14‎"I've said it before, ""Comeback Song"" just sounds like it was meant to be the opening track for a movie or something. I mean, I've used it"
2015-03-14‎Man, this Curtain Call intro makes the old one look like a joke. I'm getting chills watching this come to life.
2015-03-14‎You guys are gonna love Send Request's new single. Just heard the master and it sounds amazing.
2015-03-14‎@freakshow180 The craziest one I ever got was a prisoner called my phone asking to talk to his mom. That was back in like 2010.
2015-03-14‎It was as if she was talking to someone next to her without realizing the message was recording. She called me twice. That's weird.
2015-03-14‎So I just got a voice mail from a woman that went on for 2 minutes about how proud she is that she makes her own cigarettes. Wtf??
2015-03-14‎@lotsoflogos They're in Curtain Call. It doesn't focus primarily on them though. The story's insane.
2015-03-14‎@lotsoflogos For getting me into voice overs. I mean cartoons were always an influence, but his crude humor instantly connected with me.
2015-03-14‎@lotsoflogos Voice acting is tough. I'm not perfect but I've come a long way. The Frog voice has been my staple. I have to thank makemebad
2015-03-14‎@makemebad35 I honestly couldn't tell you who's racked up the closest yardage to Murray since 2002 (Dallas).
2015-03-14‎@makemebad35 Running game since Smith retired. I mean, yeah I think Murray would've been overpaid, but losing him hurts.
2015-03-14‎@makemebad35 I don't understand that decision at all. You have a RB that broke Smith's rushing record and you let him walk? We've had lousy
2015-03-14‎@lotsoflogos Well it's more of a thing I just do for fun, let alone a serious role. I'm not the greatest at getting stuff done promptly.
2015-03-14‎@lotsoflogos Trust me, it takes a LOT to annoy me haha
2015-03-14‎@Nada_Remah The very instant I saw Battle of the Bands, I thought they looked similar. Sonata's voice was way different than I pictured lol
2015-03-14‎@GLITCHIPLlER I remember so many Spongebob quotes but that one about being born with glass bones and paper skin still me laugh my ass off.
2015-03-14‎@SRjonn So eager to hear it. Andrew sent me the unmixed version like a month ago and even in that stage it sounded great.
2015-03-13‎This is the most original, unique, crazy, planned out, technical video that I've ever done. It brings the series home and full circle.
2015-03-13‎I keep saying if only you knew how much work is going into this thing. This is a finale to something special. I'm pushing the limits.
2015-03-13‎It brought some major rewrites to the script which ended up improving the story. I swear to god things happen for a reason.
2015-03-13‎What's crazy is the cut is even better than the original I had before the hard drive failure. I'm actually really glad that happened.
2015-03-13‎Man, this video seriously feels like a short movie and I'm not even 1/4 way done with it.
2015-03-13‎@Queeen_Sammyy You'll find out in the film. There's foreshadowing in Absolution.
2015-03-13‎@mattmemelo @makemebad35 haha that's so cool. He needs his red wheels though. They be bitchin.

2015-03-13‎Can't sleep, so here's a funny comparison edit. I can't believe how similar this looks haha Not made by me. http://t.co/riQ7E8TfFS
2015-03-13‎Wow..I can't believe what I just wrote hahaha man is it nice to have humor in there again.
2015-03-13‎RT @Queeen_Sammyy: @PioneersProd stop making me excited for things you dick
2015-03-13‎I should just keep going with this thing. Make it as big as I can to be like a movie. I'm up for the challenge. It's too good not to.
2015-03-13‎It ends the series so why not go out in style right? The story's really good though. This would be perfect for the 7 year anniversary.
2015-03-13‎Good god, this video is going to be the longest video I've ever made. I just wrote another scene. This could end up being 40 minutes long.
2015-03-13‎I'm going to be working on this until May at this rate.  X(
2015-03-13‎Like, you have no idea. There's the film footage, soundtracks, an original song, animation, graphics, digital stuff, and vocal overdubs.
2015-03-13‎Curtain Call has so much stuff that my mind cant handle it. It's like a million puzzle pieces got scattered and I have to put them together.
2015-03-13‎Curse me for having such a crazy over the top imagination when it comes to animating. I love you mind but you make me go through hell.
2015-03-13‎@thesquirrel1000 Not until after Curtain Call is out. All of my time is going into that thing.
2015-03-13‎@lotsoflogos Funny, a guy not too long ago was considering me for a voice over role.
2015-03-13‎@thesquirrel1000 The time difference has to suck lol I wasn't on long. Only 2 hours.

2015-03-09‎@DinoHowell I still hate you for changing your at name after I put it in a video. ~_~
2015-03-08‎Even the opening intro section. That was made when I was really into the moment. Having to recreate that is almost impossible.
2015-03-08‎You have no idea how stressful it is to completely start over and completely recreate effects and edits you made from over a month ago.

2015-03-07‎Like it's the original intro cut without all of the sound effects and flame graphics. I thought that was long lost.
2015-03-07‎Interesting what you find when you go deep into your external drives. Found the original Anthology cut where I first used Comeback Song.

2015-03-06‎Well success, the hard drive still works. Now's the fun process of re-installing every program app I've ever installed. X(
2015-03-06‎@makemebad35 It had to be a bad file in the software update. That was the last thing I did before restarting. Coincidence? =\
2015-03-06‎@Nighty74 I know =(  This drive's only a year old. It makes no sense. Had to be a bad file.
2015-03-06‎Then it wouldn't boot past the apple screen and said the drive couldn't be repaired. So idk. Thanks Apple.
2015-03-06‎It's either pure coincidence or b/c of the software security update I installed. I installed it yesterday, restarted the Mac 8 hours later,

2015-03-05‎It really is one of the greatest productions that I've ever worked on. It breaks all of the rules from the previous episodes.
2015-03-05‎Curtain Call is going to blow you away. So far it's making Extinction through Absolution look like a joke. I know I'm really hyping this but

2015-03-05‎This shot is something that you would rarely do. It'll look great in the end but my god. I've never spent so much time on one shot.
2015-03-05‎Animators, I salute you. I can't believe I've been spending 2 hours making something that is going to be on and off the screen in 5 seconds.

2015-03-04‎Right now it's as if I'm back at square one because my finger bends halfway. I can't believe how bad I fucked up from this.

2015-03-04‎I can't believe I'm saying this but I might have to get surgery again...Barring a miracle, I could either go six months and hope the scar

2015-03-04‎Especially while working on Curtain Call, I'm amazed at how far I've come. I've gone from straight video, to edited video, to making

2015-03-04‎Like, quite often I just sit back and watch what I've made and say that I have a gift that not everyone has. I've made days worth of videos.
2015-03-04‎I'm in the mood right now where I could make a 30 minute video saying how thankful I am for my fanbase.
2015-03-03‎Everything is so much more alive. Still a long way to go but this is fun.
2015-03-03‎Not having mouth movement in all of these pentalogy episodes has made me cringe. Now Ember actually moves. Her hair moves, her mouth, arms.
2015-03-03‎I am officially a kid in a candy store right now...this is amazing....Why did I not use Flash in the past?? This is awesome.
2015-03-03‎For years I've always wanted to be able to animate a character. I can't believe it. I'm blowing my old videos out of the water.

2015-03-03‎@makemebad35 It's really different. I don't even know how the mechanics work. Saw Markiplier play it earlier.
2015-03-03‎It's dark but humorous at the same time. If it goes according to plan, it'll be the greatest thing I've ever made.

2015-03-02‎This is why this one is going to take so long. I think this could take me into mid-April to finish...It'll be worth it, but so much to do.
2015-03-02‎There's animation, story bording, green screening, and so on. It is insane. My Mac is gonna fry before this is finished.
2015-03-02‎This feels like I'm working on a movie because of how much stuff is going into this. There's original soundtracks, there's an original song,
2015-03-02‎I'm using Flash for this video, so things will finally be animated. That's the one thing this series has lacked.

2015-02-23‎If you're wondering why I'm going mad it's b/c I'm changing the entire wardrobe. I cheated with the Absolution model. It wasn't full scaled.

2015-02-22‎The Absolution model took me 8-10 hours to perfect. That's mainly why there's only one perspective through these videos.

2015-02-17‎Would you be interested in seeing some of the Xbox compilations back on YouTube? Thinking about re-uploading some on the Anthology channel.

2015-02-02‎I'm sad another NFL season is over though. It always goes too fast. That's the downside to the Super Bowl. Thank you for another great year.
2015-02-02‎See? Yet again, the team in white wins the Super Bowl. The 10th team in the last 11 years.  ;D
2015-02-02‎@makemebad35 I still don't believe it lol After that catch, that was a given that SEA was gonna win.
2015-02-02‎Seattle's a beast of a football team. I didn't think NE had a chance in hell of winning today. Congrats #Patriots! Hell of a game.
2015-02-02‎Sorry for being over the top guys. I've just been so sick and tired of Seattle. For Tom Brady to win another Super Bowl is great to witness.
2015-02-02‎There's no way in hell NE won this game.
2015-02-02‎I'm half drunk but my god. I don't believe what I just saw.
2015-02-02‎@TheArchfiend Way better than last year. I thought for sure SEA was gonna score and win it.

2015-01-12‎@DezBryant Every player knows that was a catch. You extended it to get it across the goal line. The rule should've been changed years ago.

2015-01-10‎@_Omg_Haley_ I've only told two people what it means. It's been around for over a year and a half.
2015-01-10‎@Queeen_Sammyy @imatu777 Very funny...you wish.  =P
2015-01-10‎@_Omg_Haley_ I am the master of facial expressions!
2015-01-10‎@_Omg_Haley_ It was just a bright white screen. Had to put something there lol Unfortunately I used my hands a lot in that video XD
2015-01-10‎@imatu777 Things will be better from now on. I don't want my viewers feeling shaky around me. It's not right.
2015-01-10‎@imatu777 I try to be. I just haven't been as good as I could be the last two years. I wish I could erase some things. Especially blocking.
2015-01-10‎@imatu777 I'm just sorry that you @Queeen_Sammyy and @_Omg_Haley_ have to put up with it. I didn't intend for all of this to happen.
2015-01-10‎@imatu777 I could care less what he's said behind my back. All it's been is fuel for me to be a better person. That's all I can say.
2015-01-10‎@imatu777 I'm not going to discuss it anymore. Being he's so interactive with you guys it's been a bigger deal than it's had to be.
2015-01-10‎@imatu777 If you'd rather have someone continue to put you down and step on you, then it's not good for your well being.
2015-01-10‎@imatu777 Even true is just a waste of my time. I want to make this community as good as it can be. Sometimes people don't see eye to eye.
2015-01-10‎@imatu777 If you want to forever hate on someone through a computer screen, be my guest. To label me with disorders and stuff that isn't
2015-01-10‎@imatu777 Especially after seeing what he tweeted about me after the fact, those opinions on me won't go away. It doesn't bother me anymore.
2015-01-10‎@imatu777 I don't need a solid answer. I made a choice that was in my best interest. If I feel someone has crossed the line, I take a stand.
2015-01-10‎@Queeen_Sammyy Why people take this so seriously. If someone doesn't like you there's no point in raging for weeks about it on Twitter.
2015-01-10‎@Queeen_Sammyy I know Twwc won't ever get over what happened but just let it go and worry about yourself, you know? I really don't see
2015-01-10‎@Queeen_Sammyy People need to just cool their jets and see what they're complaining about. I'm glad I got that out.Hate doesn't help anyone.

2015-01-10‎@WolfofIntent It's all a part of life. You can't let it get to you though. Press onward.  =)
2015-01-10‎I see great things in store for the future. Even though I can't upload daily, I know we can continue to build something special.
2015-01-10‎If people think I'm trash, then they think I'm trash. They never meant anything to me anyway. Life's too short for hatred and grudges.
2015-01-10‎Just because I'm struggling doesn't mean I should bring my viewers down. No one needs to be a part of that. Thanks for believing in me.  =)
2015-01-10‎It's just the internet but I still want to be a good role model. People look up to me, and that's not something I've had before.
2015-01-10‎I know things will be better relationship-wise with my viewers. I'm tired of the fights. I can name six people that I've dealt with.
2015-01-10‎It doesn't bother me if everyone isn't for the gaming change. I'm just going to do what I feel is right. Nothing lasts forever.
2015-01-10‎I really let myself go the last two years. I was frustrated. I was lost. I felt worthless. But it still dawned on me that I have a purpose.
2015-01-10‎A better YouTuber. I'm making it a point to clean up my social media and be a better person.Theres no reason you should see that side of me.
2015-01-10‎I might not have explained this as in detail as I'd have liked to in the video but with this change to games I'm going to do my best to be
2015-01-09‎I put annotations on the video (disappear after a minute) and in the description so you can see how the video is divided up.
2015-01-09‎Here is the video about all of the changes that are coming to the channel - http://t.co/zsbkpUBc7H
2015-01-09‎You know....FUCK ME....I just found three songs that I had the words wrong...I quit  XP
2015-01-09‎"I sing along with the song, come across a lyric video..  0_0  ""y-you're fucking kidding..."""
2015-01-09‎I am so tired of this curse that I bear where I have this inescapable ability to mistake song lyrics, even months after hearing the song.
2015-01-09‎I'll have to upload this tomorrow. Been 5 hours and still hasn't exported fully. Sorry about this. It really is worth the wait though.
2015-01-09‎It's been a LONG time since I just sat in front of the camera and just flat out told you what's going on. I don't do that often enough.
2015-01-09‎It's not every day that I upload a 22 minute video. Forgot how long it takes to render and export. This one is worth the wait though.
2015-01-09‎Man, this video is still exporting. It's been 3 1/2 hours. I'm trying to get it up soon. Might be a couple hours.
2015-01-09‎"@Queeen_Sammyy That portion always gets me. From ""Let it go"" to ""Here I stand""."
2015-01-08‎I cover a lot in this video. I'll put in annotations so you can see how it's divided up. It's a 20 minute talk, so lots to cover.
2015-01-08‎@Jack_Septic_Eye I think they're just looking for attention. People do anything to stir something up on the Internet.
2015-01-08‎The entire thing but I said what had to be said. Stay tuned.
2015-01-08‎A video on all of the changes will be out later tonight. I really talked from the heart in this one. I don't expect everyone to watch
2015-01-08‎@imatu777 I'm the sanest there ever was were...?????!!!!!&amp;$&amp;'nk
2015-01-08‎@Queeen_Sammyy Good times...
2015-01-08‎@imatu777 It's not lol Had one last year where I brutally strangled &amp; stabbed him to death. I like Joe Pesci.Why is he trying to killing me?
2015-01-08‎@freakshow180 I'll trade you. The other night I had another dream about Joe Pesci shooting at me. That's like the seventh time.
2015-01-08‎@sonicfreak04 I'm going to start with fresh stuff. Outlast has been way overdone. Don't want to look like a bandwagon channel.
2015-01-08‎@_Omg_Haley_ I don't want to give away too much but a segment in Absolution is all thanks to you ;D
2015-01-08‎Although I will say that there are hidden symbolism, morals, and meanings in my videos. You might not see them but they're there. ;D
2015-01-08‎That's my two cents. Sorry for blowing your feed up. I can't let people step on me without my side of the story.
2015-01-08‎I've only seen one other fan overreact in that kind of fashion &amp; that was a 15 year old that didnt know what the hell he was doing.It's sad.
2015-01-08‎Them has been involved with the fan base for years. I can't even go a day without seeing crap anymore. Let it go.
2015-01-08‎I didn't ask for all of this YouTube drama. I can't even tell you how much shit got posted that isn't even true. It doesn't help when one of
2015-01-08‎"If my gaming videos become memorable in the future I cant wait to turn around and say ""I told you so"".You can do anything if you really try."
2015-01-08‎I love my fan base. The last thing I want is to block someone. I don't need stuff like that slowing me down.
2015-01-08‎If I block you and you STILL talk shit at me weeks later, I don't know what more you want out of me. People need to move on and let it go.
2015-01-08‎It just blows my mind how people just put words in your mouth and make you out to be something based on YouTube content.
2015-01-08‎"I guarantee when I post Absolution there will be Twitter rumors about me. ""Oh he's depressed because of his actions in his videos""."
2015-01-08‎People just really fucking irritate me. I'm sorry. I try my best to ignore it but when people post shit that isn't true, just screw off.
2015-01-08‎There's no sense in just sitting around dwelling on your decreasing analytics. Do something about it, which is exactly what I'm doing.
2015-01-08‎If you were stuck in limbo with your subscriber count for 2 years, you'd be frustrated too. This is all factoring into this big change.
2015-01-08‎I'm sorry but I had to say this. YouTube is a choice. I love what I do, even if it isn't my profession. I wish it could be. I'd be ecstatic.
2015-01-08‎"Would you rather me say, ""Oh, I'm leaving YouTube because my views suck. Thanks for nothing assholes.""? No. I take pride in this channel."
2015-01-08‎I've established a community. I cherish this community. Who are you to say that I take it too seriously?
2015-01-08‎Compare me to someone lower that struggles to hit 100 views. Them complaining about their spot is WAY different than my situation.
2015-01-08‎All I'm saying is YouTube isn't always fun and games. I've lost sleep over trying to make my content as good as it can be.
2015-01-08‎Popularity like I used to? Of course not. Do I want to grow and expand my audience? Yes. That's different than aiming for stardom.
2015-01-08‎Their spots through putting in hard work into their creations. I did the same thing. Did I get as popular? Obviously not. Do I care about
2015-01-08‎Difficult it is to stay relevant and fresh on YouTube. Do you think markiplier, Damian, Jack Septiceye, etc don't try too hard? They earned
2015-01-08‎I've had quite a few of my viewers tell me this over the years. You don't get to 9,000 subscribers by being lazy. You have no idea how
2015-01-08‎"The one thing that irritates me is when someone criticizes me for trying ""too hard"" on YouTube when they don't even make content."
2015-01-08‎@Jack_Septic_Eye That always irritates me. Sad thing is some aren't even aware after they post their comments.
2015-01-08‎@_Omg_Haley_ @imatu777 @Queeen_Sammyy Gaming is a completely different type of production. It's less stressing. Has its cons though.
2015-01-08‎@_Omg_Haley_ @imatu777 @Queeen_Sammyy Part of the frustration was putting together scripted videos that lacked views. Gaming is different.
2015-01-08‎@_Omg_Haley_ @imatu777 @Queeen_Sammyy With growing older. I was younger. I didn't have anything to worry about. I'm 22 now.
2015-01-08‎@_Omg_Haley_ @imatu777 @Queeen_Sammyy Also, Mark is who he is. Everyone's different lol I was the happy funny guy for years, but it died
2015-01-08‎@imatu777 @_Omg_Haley_ @Queeen_Sammyy That's why I'm making changes. There isn't a point in continuing something that's burning out.
2015-01-08‎@markiplier I can't believe you still have that as your profile picture  XD
2015-01-07‎@imatu777 You like this video, and so on. Even if there's negative aspects, I wish my viewers were more vocal.
2015-01-07‎"@imatu777 ""This was great!"" but no one EVER goes in-depth with feedback. I put all of this work into it. I want to know WHAT you like, WHY"

2015-01-07‎I'm going to hell for laughing at how this finale video ends. My sick twisted acting and editing is at it again.
2015-01-07‎I was deleting something about a quarter way into the timeline. That cost me 20 minutes of editing progress. I love editing but fuck.
2015-01-07‎I love you but please stop deleting sections of clips. Like earlier I somehow had a clip that was at the end of the project selected when
2015-01-07‎I swear to god my video editor is haunted. Stuff keeps mysteriously getting deleted and throws out 10+ minutes of work. You...douchebag...
2015-01-07‎Dying with style (GTA V). http://t.co/KLu4VlXOhR
2015-01-07‎@Queeen_Sammyy Also the frustration of not getting farther with the channel was taking a toll. There's a lot people don't know about.
2015-01-07‎@Queeen_Sammyy One thing lead to another and before I knew it, I was in a 10 ft hole.There have been a lot of distractions the last 2 years.
2015-01-07‎@Queeen_Sammyy I made bad decisions but I can't even blame myself. I grew bored of YouTube. I axed people that had differing opinions.
2015-01-07‎@Queeen_Sammyy It doesn't bother me. I feel like I let my viewers down these last 2 years. It's not them, it's me. This will be a new start.
2015-01-07‎I'm still shaky on how the viewers are going to take this departure. I still haven't made the video yet. Some don't know this is the end.
2015-01-07‎It's my last production and it sure feels like it. I could always make something new down the road but this is the end of something special.
2015-01-07‎I'm just waiting for Mallorie to get her voice over to me and the video will be pretty much finished.
2015-01-07‎I even surprised myself with how some things turned out in this. It shows what you can do if you just put in some effort.
2015-01-07‎Doesn't matter if they don't make sense to you, there's a lot of symbolism and morals in this series. I couldn't have written it better.
2015-01-07‎Is a work of art for a low budget YouTube video series. I never intended to have a 5 part series. These are without question my best work.
2015-01-07‎You know, when Absolution is out and some time passes, I hope one day someone goes back and watches this pentalogy and sees that this
2015-01-06‎@Jack_Septic_Eye It's always either too quiet or too loud.
2015-01-06‎@Jack_Septic_Eye I wish there was a way to record the audio so it's automatically balanced without distortion or having to amplify it.

2015-01-06‎To think I made all of the music for Resurrection in two weeks, while shooting for 20 days. I still dont know how that got finished in time.
2015-01-06‎Looking back, I can't believe I composed 10 tracks for scenes in Resurrection. Absolution doesn't have nearly as big of an original score.
2015-01-06‎@_Omg_Haley_ Heyyy, at least I don't wait months to clean my room  =P
2015-01-06‎@WolfofIntent Who doesn't love food?  =P
2015-01-06‎I just found a piece of chocolate on my floor that's been there for at least 6-10 years.
2015-01-06‎It's weird to think that everything will be dust one day.
2015-01-05‎@makemebad35 I don't think one call decides a game but it was a BIG one. Idk how Dez didn't get unsportsmanlike conduct.
2015-01-05‎@makemebad35 Yeah, that's all you can really say. They had their opportunities and fumbled twice. Also let up that huge 4th &amp; 6.
2015-01-05‎I'll be honest, I thought Dallas was as good as done in the 3rd quarter. It got ugly quick. It'll be talked about all week.
2015-01-05‎That was one game that looked like it was rigged. I won't lie about that. Still not as bad as the SF SEA championship game last year though.
2015-01-05‎If Dallas goes on to win the Super Bowl this year, yesterday's game will live in infamy for the terrible officiating.
2015-01-05‎Would go bonkers too. I don't care how they do it but it feels good to be winning.
2015-01-05‎Sorry for those explosive tweets. If your team won one playoff game since 1996 and went through 3 straight (8-8) seasons, choking, you
2015-01-05‎@imatu777 I have a stash of 11 bottles to use for pics like this lol

2015-01-05‎RT @makemebad35: @PioneersProd must feel great! and silencing those Romo haters saying how he chokes all the time. Romo IS clutch.

2015-01-05‎Stafford...if you hit Megatron for a TD, I'm gonna kill ya.

2015-01-05‎DON'T...FUCK....UP...DEFENSE!
2015-01-05‎@makemebad35 After years of these close games I'm still not used to it. Romo still delivers in the clutch...now it's up to the defense...
2015-01-05‎I haven't been able to breathe for the last 20 minutes.
2015-01-05‎I'm dead.
2015-01-05‎This game....holy hell... #DETvsDAL
2015-01-04‎Let's go Cowboys! Time to be great! #CowboysNation
2015-01-04‎@makemebad35 I think it'll be close but Dallas wins. Cowboys have too much to prove to choke now.
2015-01-04‎This is going to be my last production. At least until the 7 year anniversary. Maybe then I'll truly end it.
2015-01-04‎This video really feels like a departure. It also feels like an accomplishment. Like a weight is off of my shoulders.
2015-01-04‎@freakshow180 It all makes sense now - http://t.co/ySILE5x1Ae
2015-01-04‎@freakshow180 Don't move to Colorado.
2015-01-04‎@Queeen_Sammyy I will after Absolution is out to celebrate.
2015-01-04‎RT @imatu777: @PioneersProd ur welc bro
2015-01-04‎RT @Queeen_Sammyy: @PioneersProd @imatu777 @_Omg_Haley_ @Sheboss_Jessy34 oh, no problem buddy!
2015-01-04‎RT @_Omg_Haley_: @PioneersProd @imatu777 @Queeen_Sammyy @Sheboss_Jessy34 no problem, Randy :)
2015-01-04‎RT @Sheboss_Jessy34: @PioneersProd love Ya!!!
2015-01-04‎@imatu777 No, I haven't forgotten what he said. I don't need someone like that slowing me down.He apologized, yes, but I'm not looking back.
2015-01-04‎We'll see what the future holds. Thanks guys.
2015-01-04‎You guys will never understand how big of a change this is. It's literally putting in all of the chips and risking it all.
2015-01-04‎You were the biggest supporters I've had on Twitter. Hope this change brings in an even bigger &amp; better audience with the charm of this one.
2015-01-04‎.@imatu777 @_Omg_Haley_ @Queeen_Sammyy @Sheboss_Jessy34 Thank you for all of your help all these years. There's many more without Twitter.
2015-01-04‎I hope to one day be as good a person as @markiplier and @Jack_Septic_Eye. They're my main motivation to do gaming videos.
2015-01-04‎This year, no more. It stops. I'm moving on with my life, I'm going to be me, and be the best that I can be. If you think otherwise, fine.
2015-01-04‎I love my viewers but I've learned that loving them too much is hazardous. There have been quite a few distractions that I've dealt with.
2015-01-04‎It's gotten to the point where I really don't care what people say anymore. That's how it should be.Don't let opposing opinions control you.
2015-01-04‎This is literally the point of no return. I'm sacrificing everything to do something I love. No doubt that I'll lose viewership from it.
2015-01-04‎"By ""mess"" I mean the state of it, not the viewers. I've had so many distractions running this channel for years and I'm ready to wrap it up."
2015-01-04‎This might even be my last production in general. I just want it the hell out already to move on from this mess of a channel.
2015-01-04‎So this will be the last normal week until the big change. Things will never be the same.
2015-01-04‎"""Absolution"" will end the series in this trilogy. I expect it out by next weekend. After that, it's games here on out."
2015-01-03‎@_Omg_Haley_ They're so pizza-y and roll-y!
2015-01-03‎Going to try and get a video out on this whole clusterfuck on Monday or Tuesday.
2015-01-03‎That way I can keep the same name and everything. The Facebook and channel are both PioneersProductions. Makes the most sense.
2015-01-03‎Alright folks, here's the final decision. I'll be putting the games on the main channel. If people unsubscribe because of that, that's okay.
2015-01-03‎@freakshow180 Alrighty then... http://t.co/wI0Cucswr7

2015-01-03‎I have no idea what I'm talking about right now.
2015-01-03‎Eyes...I see eyes...they're so pretty...I want them! 😲
2015-01-03‎@_Omg_Haley_ That's still a thing? Didn't know people still went to roller rinks these days. Haven't been to one in over ten years.

2015-01-02‎@freakshow180 Does this mean you're no longer a part of our Fresca clan? That was a thing...
2015-01-02‎Just remember that if this gaming channel develops into something, I'll NEVER forget everyone who supported my original channel.
2015-01-02‎It makes me feel like I've done something right. I know I haven't been the greatest role model at times, but no one is perfect.
2015-01-02‎In reality these last few years have been the greatest from a feedback perspective. I hardly ever get negativity on my videos.
2015-01-02‎For some it might not seem like it but I've accomplished a LOT with my channel. I always appreciate the feedback, good or bad.
2015-01-02‎I still can't thank you all enough for all of the support over these last 6 1/2 years. I still have yet to make a video on the change.
2015-01-02‎I don't think I'll ever truly stop doing videos on PioneersProductions. I still have some ideas left, but things won't be like they used to.
2015-01-02‎It's going to be a weird transition balancing two separate audiences. Once that channel gets rolling it's never going to be the same.
2015-01-02‎I'll do a Live stream one of these nights. Not sure when. It'll be one of the last normal ones before the games start.
2015-01-02‎A transition isn't a way of giving up, it's a sense of moral victory.
2015-01-02‎A moment of reflection. http://t.co/Cd297rzsDW
2015-01-01‎@Queeen_Sammyy You know you'd ask  =P
2015-01-01‎It just blows my mind how fast 2014 went. It doesn't seem like a year. It's sad in a way but celebratory at the same time. I love New Years.
2015-01-01‎New Year's always has a special place in my heart. It's the end of one chapter and the beginning of a new one. It's always a fun experience.
2015-01-01‎For those of you who didn't do anything special for New Year's, that's okay  =)  I hope all of you had a good night.

2014-12-31‎@imatu777 I will admit though that I'm a fun drunk to hang out with. Since I'm so thin I get drunk pretty easily.
2014-12-31‎@imatu777 I just don't like getting drunk. It was fun for little while but it just doesn't feel worth it anymore. Holidays are the only time
2014-12-31‎@Nighty74 I haven't done a New Year's stream in 3 years. Glad people still remember them :D  Since I'm legal now I go out partying instead.

2014-12-31‎Last night was one of those acid trip dreams. It's the last day of the year so everything crazy has to mix together? Messed up stuff.
2014-12-31‎I dreamed my cat was playing hide and seek with a lion under a table.
2014-12-31‎I think this one is some of my best work. It's just subtle things. Can't wait to finish it.
2014-12-31‎It's nice to finally be having fun making a video again...it's been since April that I've been happy making one. It shows in this.
2014-12-31‎"It's 3:30am and I just edited something special. ""Absolution"" is turning out way better than I thought it would. It's about 85% finished."
2014-12-31‎It's a bit sad when you go to delete a finished project from your editor timeline. I spent a month on it and just like that it's gone.

2014-12-29‎I wonder how some of you are going to react to this video. This is one of the most serious videos that I've ever made. Great story-wise.
2014-12-29‎"""Absolution"", coming to your YouTube screen January 2015. http://t.co/YzkKG7oWtH"
2014-12-29‎So if Dallas wins next week they go to Green Bay. This is going to be a crazy year of playoff rounds. Time to be great #CowboysNation
2014-12-28‎@makemebad35 It feels like it could finally be the year. I feel like they could beat almost anyone. Would've killed to have a bye though.
2014-12-28‎How 'bout them Cowboys? Undefeated on the road. Never expected that. This year has been insane. Going to be nerve racking in the playoffs.

2014-12-27‎"This is the third time I've rewritten ""Absolution"". Get it together mind! I think I wrote something special in this one. Bringing the feels."
2014-12-27‎There's so many visions in my mind that I wish could be made into videos. It's always easy in your head,quite a different story creating it.

2014-12-24‎I plan on doing at least two more big videos. I'm just forever thankful that you guys appreciate the hard work I put into them.  =)
2014-12-24‎So there's things going on behind the scenes that you don't know about. This has happened for the last two years. It's frustrating.
2014-12-24‎Fortunately, you guys never see those moments. I had a video once where I just flat out raged for not getting my words out properly.
2014-12-24‎Also mainly because it just isn't fun anymore. There have been a lot of times where it's just been more frustrating than anything.
2014-12-24‎You gotta understand, I've been doing this for 6 1/2 years. I can't do it forever lol There comes a time when you need to move on.
2014-12-24‎I haven't made a video on this change yet but I'm glad that most of you approve of the transition to gaming content.
2014-12-24‎@imatu777 Be honest, what is the last video I've made that was truly great (not counting this year)? It goes back to the Furby one in 2012.
2014-12-24‎@imatu777 PioneersProductions will never die. It's just branching out to better things.  ;D

2014-12-21‎@imatu777 Not at all. I know after all of these years to take a joke, especially from you lol No worries.
2014-12-21‎@twwc960 That ordeal did give me fuel though to try to be a better person. I take some things too seriously at times. No hard feelings  =)

2014-12-20‎@MuscleRyan Indeed I am.  :D
2014-12-20‎@imatu777 Yeah, good point. I've always just referred to my videos as skits but these were darker. First two technically were comedic.
2014-12-20‎It's still crazy and cool to look back at every video I made this year and how they were all sequels to each other. Didn't plan that.
2014-12-20‎"This will end the ""Extinction/Resurrection"" series. I never expected to make three parts for one plot. In reality it's five."

2014-12-17‎@_Omg_Haley_ Sad thing is I never watched his videos, ever. Not even now. I think I'm going to try and give them a chance.

2014-12-16‎@FeaturedDavid Found an old pic from a BlogTv stream in 2011. You had to tell me how to take a screenshot on a Mac XD http://t.co/BrCFtB3GK1
2014-12-15‎It's not going to be an easy road, but I'm ready for a new beginning. Thank you all for hanging in there and sticking with me.
2014-12-15‎I can't erase the mistakes but I can find ways to be better each &amp; every day. Life is shit but that shouldn't hold me back from what I love.
2014-12-15‎I am going to make it a point to be a better YouTuber and role model in 2015. With all of the distractions that I've had, it's been tough.
2014-12-15‎I'll also have a video out hopefully tomorrow talking about all of the big changes that are going to be happening. It's going to be hard...
2014-12-15‎I'll still be using Twitter, it's just the Facebook page that's changing. It'll be easier to interact with everyone compared to friends.
2014-12-15‎My personal Facebook won't be active by the end of the week, so I'm trying to transfer everything. Thanks for those who have switched over!

2014-12-14‎The time is right to make a change. I hope you guys support me on this one because it's a big one....
2014-12-14‎I've made so many videos talking about this change that I scrapped and never uploaded. It really is for the best.
2014-12-14‎I have at the least two more videos that I want to make. I'm thinking that by June 9, 2015 I will be doing the gaming channel primarily.
2014-12-14‎It's something that I want to do. I've done so much in 6 1/2 years on my main channel, but there comes a time when you have to move on.
2014-12-14‎The trilogy video will be one of the last videos I make on my main channel for quite a while. After that, all of my content will be gaming.
2014-12-14‎If some of you don't approve of it, that's all well and good with me. I'm going to do what I feel is best and what will make me happier.
2014-12-14‎The key factor in making content is having fun. Sadly, I haven't been for the majority of this year. I'm going to be making a change.
2014-12-14‎There could possibly be a major change to my channel in 2015 that some of you might not like.I'm considering going in a different direction.
2014-12-14‎@freakshow180 You'd be surprised if you knew how many personal messages I got with offers in my YouTube inbox.

2014-12-13‎@freakshow180 I loved it. A lot of people despise that film lol Best Disney film Ive seen in a long time..actually Disney never disappoints.
2014-12-12‎I bought Frozen. What is wrong with me?

2014-12-08‎I just haven't been happy these last 2 years so it took a toll on my comedic stuff. Turned to darker &amp; abstract content because it's easier.
2014-12-08‎Because I need SOMETHING to make between these long production videos. I know you guys mostly prefer comedic stuff, which I've lacked.

2014-12-06‎As I've said, don't be surprised if this video takes until February to finish. There's a lot to do, plus the soundtrack.
2014-12-06‎This video in itself could go on forever. I'm really trying to get a solid script going because possibilities are endless.
2014-12-06‎The trilogy will have twice the amount of post-production work that Resurrection had. Lots of technical edits that are subtle but effective.

2014-11-27‎@TheZacMartin If you have a direct download EXE file, it'll work. I wasted $14 trying to get the proper file.
2014-11-27‎@TheZacMartin I learned the hard way with this. I have Steam but the software I downloaded to run Windows games can't run Steam games.
2014-11-27‎@TheZacMartin I've loved the franchise for months but just now figured out how to play them on a Mac. Lots of fun...but man is it hard.
2014-11-27‎@Queeen_Sammyy It scared me. I thought the game glitched. I just read some comments on the Wiki about it.
2014-11-27‎I still have no idea what the fuck that is...I got that image of Toy Bonnie after getting killed on Night 5. http://t.co/OPN9nXIhX7
2014-11-27‎Nights 4-6 can go play in 5 lane traffic. This game is so incredibly hard. It relies on luck more than skill most of the time.
2014-11-27‎I give up...for now. I've been trying to beat Night 6 for 2 1/2 damn hours! The original game took me until Night 6 to die ONCE.
2014-11-27‎Scott, why you make this game so picky?! God, I keep getting killed for not putting the mask on fast enough. It's so cheap.
2014-11-27‎Did I mention that I love this game.................................?
2014-11-27‎I've been trying to beat Night 6 for almost 2 hours and still can't get passed 3am. This game is turning into a love/hate relationship..
2014-11-27‎Golden Freddy killed me??! Whaattt??! I've never seen him in FNAF2 until now. It was only 12am! http://t.co/FZUJ0Q9hjx

2014-11-26‎Idk how but I beat the Worms 2 Armageddon campaign. That was one of the most frustrating games I've ever beaten.
2014-11-26‎It just took me around 50 tries to beat this fucking stage.
2014-11-26‎THANK YOU GOOOODDDDDD!
2014-11-26‎Why am I still playing...
2014-11-26‎Eeeefffffff!!!
2014-11-26‎@imatu777 Noo! This game's been kicking my ass for days. I have like 10 stages left.
2014-11-26‎@TheArchfiend Oh man. Anything can happen. Still gotta see where this season goes. Prepare for another QB controversy...
2014-11-26‎I need a beer and a frozen pizza. Fuck this game..I'll be back you little shits..you worms haven't seen the last of mehh!
2014-11-26‎@TheArchfiend What would be the point if you already have Sanchez who's playing decent and Foles??
2014-11-26‎@badassgamer397 Worms 2 campaign. It is the biggest load of ass X(
2014-11-26‎I'm about to scream...
2014-11-26‎"If I hear ""welcome to the cheese house"" one more blasted time in this game...."
2014-11-26‎I am going to throw Worms 2 out the window and set it on fire. Goddd! Campaign is so ridiculously hard! They hit you every fucking time!

2014-11-26‎@twwc960 @Lanier3000 It wasn't anything I did. The engine is shot. Costs $3000 to fix. We can't afford that and isn't worth it.

2014-11-25‎My car's shot. Unbelievable. Why does this shit keep happening?? Life has really not been treating me well these last two years.
2014-11-25‎Prepare for another Five Nights At Freddy's 2 fail compilation....
2014-11-25‎Just spent the last 15 mins talking to the cat and I swear it was nodding at me when I asked it questions.I had one beer so I'm not trippin.
2014-11-25‎@WolfofIntent Took me a minute to realize what happened. The very second I looked at CNN he got jacked. Looked back and thought shots fired.
2014-11-25‎@Nighty74 That almost made me tear up...
2014-11-25‎@freakshow180 I know, I was pointing out that someone was Live streaming in the thick of the action. Then he got his phone stolen Live, wtf?

2014-11-25‎@Queeen_Sammyy You already have better grades than I've ever had in my high school career. o.0
2014-11-25‎Thank you, guys. Remember, you all matter, no matter what anyone else says. You can do anything, as @markiplier said. WE can do anything. =)
2014-11-25‎"That would be a like painting a target on you and walking into a war zone and saying ""shoot me""."
2014-11-25‎Theres been some rough speed bumps but I'm still going strong. No matter what I'll always be a YouTuber. I'm sorry for threatening to leave.
2014-11-25‎Thank you guys for believing in me and sticking around all of these years =)  It's because of you that I've gotten this far and try my best.
2014-11-25‎Not many YouTubers last or get nearly this far with making videos. I'm stunned with what I can make nowadays compared to 2008.
2014-11-25‎Man...how the fuck did I get here? 6 years ago I just turned on a camera and tried to shoot whatever, now I'm making short films..daaamnn...
2014-11-25‎I know you guys generally like whatever I put out, so that's comforting, but I want this to be good. It's going to be a frustrating road.
2014-11-25‎The one thing I'm not sure on is how long this will take to do. This could take me 2 months...maybe a month if I'm lucky. It's a challenge.
2014-11-25‎This is going to be the most challenging thing that I've ever edited. I'm scared...nervous...but ready...
2014-11-25‎@imatu777 This is going to be the ultimate test of my editing skills.
2014-11-25‎@imatu777 The writing is never the issue. It's the video and effects. I'm taking a plunge here and have no idea what's gonna happen in post.
2014-11-25‎Man..this video is a cluster fuck of hell. I have NO idea how I'm even going to remotely pull this off but fuck it, I'm going for it.
2014-11-25‎I love how my mind works when I'm writing videos. It can take a complete 180 out of nowhere. Love you, mind!  &gt;:D
2014-11-25‎But if we manage to litter box train her, we're going to keep her. I'm slowly growing attached, just taking a while.
2014-11-25‎It has a wound on its backside that needs treatment. I've never seen a cat react so calm at the vet before. I'm stunned.
2014-11-25‎It was so strange and sad going to the vet without Bruno tonight. Took the cat to get examined. Found out it was a female.
2014-11-24‎RT @Nighty74: @PioneersProd #PrayForRandysCar
2014-11-24‎I'm just going to hope that the issue is something else. In all likelihood, October 30th was my last time driving that car =(
2014-11-24‎We have some of the worst luck with vehicles. I love that Neon, almost even more than my old car. I can't imagine losing it already...
2014-11-24‎To replace, $3000.....unbelievable. My dad just got a new truck, hit a deer. My brother just hit a deer. My mom's car is almost shot too.
2014-11-24‎The bad news isn't nearly as pleasant..my car might be shot. The 2005 Dodge Neon that I've only had for a year and a half, has a bad engine.
2014-11-24‎So I have some good news and some bad news...the good news is my Taco Bell drought finally just ended. =)

2014-10-31‎@Queeen_Sammyy 98% of my fanbase is asleep at the wheel. There's always dark symbolism in my videos now. Has been since Figure In Black.
2014-10-31‎@Queeen_Sammyy Because it's real. I'm actually taking stuff out of my dark thoughts, rather than basing ideas off cliches.
2014-10-31‎@imatu777 http://t.co/fuFXCuuhms
2014-10-31‎@Queeen_Sammyy That was LAST September. Took the Figure In Black route and never looked back.
2014-10-31‎@Queeen_Sammyy Now it's all dark and suspense. I haven't written a legit comedy since the radio video.
2014-10-31‎@Queeen_Sammyy It's so weird...it's as if that side of my videos is dead. I was thinking about this earlier, how I've changed.
2014-10-31‎It's based off a real event that makemebad35 experienced, only I took it further. The name Jen was actually coincidental.
2014-10-31‎Did anyone catch where the Jen scene came from in Resurrection? ;D

2014-10-30‎Everywhere you went here there were FBI Most Wanted ads for this guy. It was ridiculous. And it happened right in our backyards.
2014-10-30‎You know the Eric Frein guy that shot those state troopers? Thats only about 20 miles from me. Glad they caught him. On the run for 6 weeks.
2014-10-30‎@imatu777 Third one won't have a deadline and will have lots of graphical improvements. Especially the Ember model.That'll be reconstructed.
2014-10-30‎@imatu777 It wasn't like I just slapped a picture on there and that was it lol those shots took forever. Getting timing down and movements.
2014-10-30‎@imatu777 The Frog/Whale bits, I could only do so much with the little time I had. I added shadows and other technical stuff to touch it up.
2014-10-30‎@imatu777 It was the worst chase sequence I ever did. So like a godsend, I had a slot this week to reshoot it at night.
2014-10-30‎@imatu777 Something you thought worked might not in the long run. If you thought bits weren't suspenseful, you're lucky I reshot that half.
2014-10-30‎@imatu777 As I said, there were lots of rewrites for this one. I even changed the ending three times. When you work on something for 3 weeks

2014-10-30‎RT @Nighty74: @PioneersProd Volume: high.... Room: dark.... let´s start the show #Resurrection
2014-10-30‎If there's any early birds watching Resurrection, turn out the lights and blast your headphone volume to get the full submersion.
2014-10-30‎So trust me,if a shot seems a bit iffy, I'm aware lol I just had to make do. Videos after this won't have a deadline. Downside to Halloween.
2014-10-30‎I'm just a perfectionist with my videos. There's always stuff I could improve. But sometimes you just gotta deal with what you have.
2014-10-30‎I didn't even plan on getting a Halloween video out this year but I'm so glad I was wrong. So I don't know why I'm critiquing myself.
2014-10-30‎But you gotta have a deadline. It is what it is. Hope you enjoy it.
2014-10-30‎I wish I could've had more time to work on it but Resurrection will be out tomorrow. I'm always eager to keep adding more shots.
2014-10-30‎Poor Twisty... #FreakShow
2014-10-30‎@best_fanpage_ It's more of a movie paced video. Different scenes and slowed down. If I had another few weeks I would've made it longer.
2014-10-30‎@freakshow180 The finding Jesus stuff was a great segment. I loved it. Even though I'm not very religious. I loved that.
2014-10-30‎@best_fanpage_ Hopefully it will surprise some people. Some good jump scares and suspense. Visuals are higher budget too.

2014-10-28‎@imatu777 I still have the raw Extinction tracks if you'd want those. I dreaded hearing those played back.
2014-10-28‎I've worked on this since the first week of October. So many sleepless nights. This video will tell the future of my channel.
2014-10-28‎But if this video doesn't get at least 500 views in a month, then it's not even worth putting this much fricken work into a video anymore.
2014-10-28‎Soundtrack and video will hopefully be finished and out tomorrow.
2014-10-28‎So many things got rewritten and reshot. I was about to pull my hair out. Now I'm in the homestretch.
2014-10-28‎I'm glad I did because it flows so much better. Production's always unpredictable. This was the weirdest process of shooting I've ever had.
2014-10-28‎But the video is supposed to be at night and it REALLY killed the atmosphere. Sunday night I had an opening and completely reshot the half.
2014-10-28‎I had to reshoot half of the video all in one night. It was for the best but man was I frustrated.The original 2nd half was shot in the day.
2014-10-28‎I'm doing my best to get Resurrection finished and out tomorrow. If not, it'll definitely be out Thursday. Something unexpected happened.
2014-10-26‎I seriously feel like a waste of space in this world anymore.

2014-10-26‎@Lanier3000 I thought I severely jammed it. I knew I did something though. Never felt a pain like that before. Somehow finished filming lol
2014-10-26‎@Lanier3000 Tore a tendon in my Extinction video. Not sure if you saw it. But it was my own fault. It just happened so fast.
2014-10-26‎@Lanier3000 It is. Finger's been stuck nearly straight up since July. The top half won't bend. It always hurts. Only have myself to blame =/

2014-10-24‎My consistent years on YouTube are long over. I don't even know if I'll continue with comedy. I like the darker stuff.
2014-10-24‎It's sucks though. I have so many ideas but they're all big scaled =\  At this rate there will be 4 videos a year X(
2014-10-24‎It's weird looking back at this year for my videos. Each video was a sequel to the other or connected to it.Never planned on that happening.
2014-10-24‎@makemebad35 I hope you're kidding...
2014-10-24‎A week today I get surgery. I recently noticed white spots appearing on my finger..I just want this over with.

2014-10-24‎Won't be as scary to you guys since you don't live here lol but maannn....I'm afraid to leave my bedroom.
2014-10-24‎This is seriously the scariest video I've ever made. I can't even explain how freaky it is, watching it right now. Feels like I'm living it.

2014-10-24‎@Queeen_Sammyy That will never happen.
2014-10-24‎But I took it a step farther. Man, this seriously is freaky. I recommend everyone watching the video with the volume on full blast.
2014-10-24‎Jeez, I seriously think this is the scariest scene I've ever written. I have someone to thank for getting the idea for it.
2014-10-24‎@Queeen_Sammyy I've been sitting here editing since 3. I'm STILL on that fucking scene lol It's a prime suspense scene so need it perfect.
2014-10-24‎It myself for the scene but then I fiddled around with it some more, and my god...I made a track that fit spot on.
2014-10-24‎I seriously cannot emphasize how big of a role music plays in horror videos. I was about to give in and download a track rather than compose
2014-10-24‎Good god..this scene is giving me the fucking creeps. And I fucking made it! Ughhghhh....
2014-10-24‎"Gods and Monsters is stuck in my head from #AHSFREAKSHOW from last night. ""No one's gonna take my soul away.."""
2014-10-23‎To me, it's always scarier what you DON'T see. I still have lots to edit, but so far this is turning out well.
2014-10-23‎One thing I will say though is this isn't a bloody video like the Furby one was. This goes back to horror basics with suspense.
2014-10-23‎As I've said, my Halloween videos incorporate fears that I personally have. It makes it all that more real for me.
2014-10-23‎It's by no means amazing, but incredibly good for someone who never composes music.
2014-10-23‎This video is very slow paced, which is why it could end up being 30 mins long. But the soundtrack is pretty damn good.
2014-10-23‎Man, I think this one scene in Resurrection is already scarier than what the entire Furby video was. The power that music can have...
2014-10-23‎@twwc960 No, when the video is exported at 24 fps, the intro graphics lag/stutter. You notice it in Extinction.
2014-10-23‎@GoldenStarlette That's cool. All it's missing are the little spell symbols.
2014-10-23‎@imatu777 But mostly because that song literally describes me. I swear that I could've wrote that.
2014-10-23‎@imatu777 Is it a top notch intro? No lol but it's still a great way to start a video. I'm also doing title cards.
2014-10-23‎@imatu777 It's a way to be more professional. I also use it as a way to promote my buddy Andrew's band. He inspired me to do the Anthology.
2014-10-23‎@twwc960 But since I use the intro now, there's no way to avoid it. It's a shame.
2014-10-23‎@twwc960 Videos are all 24 fps. Anthology was 30. It's a gripe I have with videography. 24 gives a nice cinematic look.
2014-10-23‎@twwc960 It'd probably look great on a TV. Only downside that the Anthology was able to avoid was the intro sequence lagging. The newer
2014-10-23‎@twwc960 I could. That and Extinction together would be a nice combo. I'll make it available through mediafire over a torrent lol

2014-10-23‎I'm stunned. This is going to be the longest video that I've ever made...this might be 30 mins long...I'm not joking....
2014-10-23‎I just had a similar chill run through me editing this Halloween video like I did with Mr. Horse Head Lives. The music really sells it.
2014-10-23‎@Queeen_Sammyy That's what it morphed into lol Everything switched.
2014-10-23‎@imatu777 No, it morphed into a police chase like something out of GTA and I got shot to death.
2014-10-23‎@TyDye501st Really? I thought that was one of my worst acting videos lol
2014-10-23‎Aughh! Next week's @AHSFX looks amazing! I can't wait. #FreakShow
2014-10-23‎@Queeen_Sammyy Dunno why but last night I dreamed that you and I met up with Andrew from Send Request. Weird..
2014-10-23‎I love the little nods to Halloween in this episode of @AHSFX.
2014-10-23‎RT @_Omg_Haley_: @PioneersProd pizza-y and roll-y xD
2014-10-23‎I blame @_Omg_Haley_ for getting me addicted to pizza rolls.
2014-10-22‎What's your favorite PioneersProductions skit video of all-time?
2014-10-22‎@imatu777 You would ~_~
2014-10-22‎@imatu777 No. This video is dark and serious.
2014-10-22‎@twwc960 None of the settings improved the video. Canon's are still amazing though.
2014-10-22‎@twwc960 That it snaps are perfect, it's the video aspect that lacks. There's always pixels moving around. There's only so many settings.
2014-10-22‎@twwc960 I'd need a better camera lens if I were to do one. I'm just not willing to spend hundreds on a lens...The thing is, the pictures
2014-10-22‎I don't even care if people aren't fond of Resurrection, just as long as the production aspect is appreciated. I've put so much into this.
2014-10-22‎It's the most that I've ever had to re-shoot for a video too. After 2 weeks I'm STILL shooting stuff. I have like 5 shots left.
2014-10-22‎I feel like I'm making a fucking movie right now. I've never shot so much footage for something like this before.
2014-10-22‎@WolfofIntent Took me a minute to see that haha That's cool.
2014-10-22‎RT @WolfofIntent: @PioneersProd X88B88 looks like the word voodoo reflecting off of itself
2014-10-22‎@twwc960 That's on me though, should've been more specific.
2014-10-22‎"@twwc960 I think you misinterpreted ""uncut"" lol By uncut, I meant a full length program without being cut into parts. YouTube had 7 parts."
2014-10-22‎"""Look"" is a weird word haha"
2014-10-22‎It's weird, I never noticed how weird some words are until I listen to voice overs. Hearing them said over and over again.
2014-10-22‎@twwc960 And after one failed attempt, she popped in my head because the fan art on my wall caught my attention. Rest is history.
2014-10-22‎@twwc960 Dreams about me and when I went to write Extinction, I needed a voice actress since I couldn't make my voice sound like a chick.
2014-10-22‎@twwc960 She's sent me fan art personally before, especially back in 2013 when everything bad was happening. She's had lots of bizarre
2014-10-22‎Mallorie's done the Ember voice in this series (Extinction/Resurrection). She's been nothing short of amazing.

2014-10-21‎@twwc960 Oh jeez, I'm sorry about that  =(  I never do torrents, so this is all new to me. Wish I could've sent physical copies to everyone.
2014-10-21‎The options are endless with this but I had to really cut the script down. This could've been a 30 minute video if I really wanted.
2014-10-21‎If only you knew how many things had to get rewritten and reshot. Its very stressing. So many subtle things that hopefully will be worth it.
2014-10-21‎But man, I'm gonna be working on this video in my sleep. There's so much to do in this that it's not even funny.
2014-10-21‎I can't sleep. So much to do. Ughh. I did rewrite the ending though, so at least I can go to bed happy.
2014-10-21‎Again..spent an hour editing something that's on and off your screen in about 5 seconds. Kill me X(

2014-10-20‎@freakshow180 I'm going to smack you. Full..blown..smack. Did I really used to say w00t that much?
2014-10-20‎@imatu777 What is it? Can't see it on mobile.
2014-10-20‎It's a big reason why I haven't done any teaser's for it. Don't want to reveal anything.
2014-10-20‎This year's Halloween video has so much more than just what you're expecting me to do. I think you'll be surprised at what's in store.
2014-10-20‎@realhartman It's crazy seeing all of these title cards again. Fanning the Flames was the episode that instantly hooked me on the show.

2014-10-19‎@makemebad35 Now on almost every site I go on there's Seahawks profile pics everywhere. You never would've seen that before 2012.

2014-10-19‎But the soundtrack in Halloween II is by far scarier to me. Still prefer Halloween but it still gives me chills.
2014-10-19‎It's weird, I saw all of Halloween II before the original Halloween when I was in around 7th grade.
2014-10-19‎Watching Halloween II. I'll never forget this scene. Scared the hell out of me. Still gives me chills. http://t.co/DN4kMg04tY

2014-10-18‎@imatu777 It was just its own thing. In a way, it was pretty much the prequel to How Is It Possible. That's the direction I ended up taking.

2014-10-17‎"""You better give me that tape, Froggy, before I rip your bulgy eyes out of your sad pathetic face!"""
2014-10-17‎I mean, hell, I've even started composing my own music for the videos. This has been a huge year for me.
2014-10-17‎But I hope I've still kept you entertained. From here on out, every video is going to be bigger scaled.
2014-10-17‎Honestly I feel these videos have been my best work, and can only see them getting better. They're longer, more in-depth, and darker.
2014-10-17‎I know some of you might not be fond of the direction I took this year with my videos.But I really hope you appreciate the production aspect
2014-10-17‎@grantkirkhope That was amazing. Nothing can beat the original though  ;D
2014-10-17‎"I've never done a video on this scale before. It's twice that of ""Extinction"". Lots of subtle things. Also gotta factor the original music."
2014-10-17‎But I am up against the clock to get this done. Giving myself a 10 day deadline. I know it'll turn out, it's just a mad rush to edit it.
2014-10-17‎I literally shot for 6 hours today. That's a LOT of footage. I think this video might crack the 20 minute club. It's a big one.
2014-10-17‎This is going to be the most stressing video that I've ever done. I want this out at least 2 days before Halloween. So..much..to..edit..
2014-10-17‎@best_fanpage_ I'm glad you made something funny out of something creepy.

2014-10-17‎This might be the most footage I've ever had for a YouTube video. I have at least 150-200+ clips.
2014-10-16‎@makemebad35 Why in gods name are you looking up this sick shit?? Lol
2014-10-16‎I have so much footage on my computer for this video that it's not even funny. Twice I ran out of free space on my hard drive.

2014-10-16‎@Queeen_Sammyy The collab video? I don't remember anything from that.
2014-10-16‎@Queeen_Sammyy What did you do...
2014-10-16‎@AHSFX I laughed way too hard at that.
2014-10-16‎@twwc960 I think it's pretty self explanatory.
2014-10-16‎Not to toot my own horn here but the music in this is pretty damn good compared to Extinction.
2014-10-16‎@imatu777 You'll find out. Something big is answered in this one.
2014-10-16‎"@imatu777 If you're wondering why her mouth never moves, she communicates through ""thoughts"", hence the echo effects."
2014-10-16‎@imatu777 All of these videos are connected. Amnesia Rape was the prequel to Extinction. This picks up exactly after Extinction.
2014-10-15‎Expect a familiar face to return this Halloween. Suspense will be felt. Questions will be answered. Are you ready? http://t.co/EQOruNrBX0
2014-10-15‎@twwc960 I just haven't been willing to spend hundreds of dollars on a sharper lens. Lighting plays a huge roll as well.
2014-10-15‎@twwc960 It mainly depends on the lens. Canon's just come as a camera body. The lens I got was just a standard zoom lens.
2014-10-15‎@imatu777 But after they're compressed and on YouTube, the quality pixelates. In Final Cut (in that picture I posted), it looks flawless.
2014-10-15‎"@imatu777 I've come a long way lol I use to use a ""hard light"" preset on my 2010-2011 videos. Nowadays I manually adjust everything."
2014-10-15‎But man, nothing beats seeing a video come to life. You can't understand it unless you done it. It's like no other.
2014-10-15‎You know what I hate? Spending a half hour editing something that literally appears on your screen for 3 seconds.  X(

2014-10-14‎@Nighty74 Still half of it left to shoot. Need the house to myself to shoot it. Might have to rig it during the day at times.
2014-10-14‎@Nighty74 Probably seems that way because there wasn't anything last year. The Figure In Black never was finished, so there's a gap lol

2014-10-10‎They blocked the entrance. Idk if someone got rear ended or what.
2014-10-10‎Oookay so I just finished my Taco Bell, look next to me and there's 3 cop cars. Whu-uut?? Like 8 spaces away with their lights going.
2014-10-10‎@Queeen_Sammyy I had to re-upload that because it really shows my true colors. It really shows how YouTube has changed me.

2014-10-09‎This is how ridiculous the timeline is. It's 90 minutes long, so you can imagine why it took forever. http://t.co/UjaUZjgzVA
2014-10-09‎I can't tell you how relieving it is for this to finally be finished. Been editing this since May. All of the 6 year stuff has been removed.
2014-10-09‎A HQ uncut torrent version will be available soon as well. This might take another week.
2014-10-09‎I'll be removing the old cut from YouTube and re-upload the finished cut. This will be cut into parts.
2014-10-09‎I can't believe it..it's..it's finally finished...After spending 5 months on this Anthology video it's finally officially finished.
2014-10-09‎I'm about 15-20 mins from finishing the Anthology. So relieved that I can finally make space on my hard drive now.
2014-10-09‎@freakshow180 Probably my favorite solo George song is My Sweet Lord. Even though he supposedly had legal issues.Dont hear the similarities.
2014-10-09‎@freakshow180 Once in a while I get a craving for new music and I'll pop a CD in.
2014-10-09‎@freakshow180 I haven't. I mean I have a solo song from Lennon, McCartney, and Harrison here and there. My dad has loads of CDs.
2014-10-09‎@freakshow180 It took me a while to get into their later years (Revolver - Let It Be). Nowadays I love all of it. Depends on my mood.
2014-10-09‎@freakshow180 I like 1964 Lennon. Just liked how all of the Beatles looked in 1964. Usually the image in my head when I picture them.
2014-10-09‎@Queeen_Sammyy I don't have a huge variety of shirts lol
2014-10-09‎@_Omg_Haley_ @Queeen_Sammyy I had to give back somehow  =)  As long as I'm making a difference for someone, that's all that matters.

2014-10-09‎So glad American Horror Story is back! #Freakshow
2014-10-09‎@makemebad35 Yeah Coven was 3rd. I loved it. It just had a lot of plot holes and bad scripting at times. Took me three episodes to like it.
2014-10-09‎@makemebad35 I'd recommend the first two seasons though. They're tough to beat.
2014-10-09‎@makemebad35 A lot of people were disappointed with Coven. This season might be crazy. I'm not all for the freak show idea though.

2014-10-07‎@Queeen_Sammyy Hey, I've had to get a shot, blood work, drug tests, and finger prints done the last two weeks. I don't wanna hear it X(
2014-10-07‎@Queeen_Sammyy I see you're taking some influence from Imatu's style of humor lol
2014-10-07‎@imatu777 That was the first time in my career that my comments were very mixed towards me. I don't even think the video lasted a day.
2014-10-07‎@imatu777 It didn't even cross my mind as being offense when I wrote and shot it. I thought it would've took off in views.
2014-10-07‎@freakshow180 Someone has some dirty fantasies...
2014-10-07‎@imatu777 And that has never happened before when I've filmed YouTube videos. Not to mention I BS'd the script and improvised.
2014-10-07‎@imatu777 And then another month for the third shoot. R&amp;P was bad because it was offensive, this I had no pride in doing.
2014-10-07‎@imatu777 Something was wrong from the very start. It took me nearly 2 months to continue filming where I'd left off.
2014-10-07‎@imatu777 Mainly say FIB was b/c of my huge lack of execution.I knew after that first night shooting that it was never going to be finished.
2014-10-07‎This is one of my most technical videos that I've ever written. If it's not done by Halloween, so be it. I really hope this turns out.
2014-10-07‎I'm not worried about the editing, I just want it shot. Figure In Black was my biggest catastrophe of work, so I want this year to excel.
2014-10-07‎I am gonna be up against the clock to get this Halloween video done..it's another big one. Going to film what I can Saturday night.
2014-10-07‎@JaggerDaLennon That's not frighting  =P
2014-10-07‎Raughh, I'm a zombie! A zombie ghost is a vengeful ghost....
2014-10-07‎Holy shit, I finally saw Curse of Chucky. THAT is how you make a good sequel. Amazing to see the horror back in that franchise.
2014-10-06‎@imatu777 I'm not the frozen type. Not even ice cream really.

2014-10-06‎@LEFTY87_nate I wouldn't care so much if it wasn't on my dominant hand. I'm always catching it on things or sleeping on it. It's agony lol

2014-10-06‎@SendRequestBand I bet it did. When I got all of the clips from the campus back in August I couldn't believe all of the great shots we had.

2014-10-06‎@imatu777 @twwc960 Writing was actually a profession I considered back then lol but then that turned into writing YouTube videos.
2014-10-06‎@imatu777 @twwc960 In all seriousness though, Imatu is good at writing dirty in-depth humor. I'm better at slower paced in-depth stories.
2014-10-06‎@imatu777 Are you saying you're underestimating my skillz as a fictional writer?
2014-10-06‎@imatu777 Bruh, I wrote stories in my free time in middle school =P  All of them ending with my main character dying might I add.
2014-10-06‎@Queeen_Sammyy @imatu777 Hey, it's no different than scripting videos. The more you do, the easier it'll get.  =)

2014-10-05‎@331EROCK A big reason why is the HD version of the song was just found after 10 years. So your video should blow up. I'll shut up now lol

2014-09-26‎Heading to Texas tomorrow. Here's an insanely fuzzy/grainy pic of the last time I was down there. http://t.co/7VJtMXuNEw
2014-09-26‎#tbt April 2011, shortly before I graduated high school. Back when I'd go outside and take a million… http://t.co/9ClGsasBGT

2014-09-24‎NEW Reaction Compilation (Slender the Arrival Xbox Version) - https://t.co/j5XvgGS89l  Some of my best screams in this one.
2014-09-24‎@twwc960 You're funny... ~_~
2014-09-24‎Uploading the Slender the Arrival reaction compilation shortly. Some good stuff in this one.
2014-09-24‎It's just the fact this is literally something I'd have nightmares about lol it hit home for me.
2014-09-24‎Haven't been able to continue since my footage is saving but mannn, it's been 20 mins and I'm still shivering from playing this game.
2014-09-24‎I just had a beer and 3 donuts...I'm ready to finish dis game!
2014-09-24‎I've never freaked out so much playing a game. And there's still more to play!
2014-09-24‎I nearly shit myself, the screen recorder for my camera and mic audio crashed and almost lost an hour's worth of footage.
2014-09-24‎Holllly shit I got some incredible footage. This game is 10x scarier now. This has stuff right out of my nightmares.
2014-09-24‎Also haven't done a gaming video in almost a month and a half, so I'm due to record something. You better be worth $10 game...
2014-09-24‎Going to play the Xbox version of Slender the Arrival. Last year I complained the game was too short. I'm ready for more levels!
2014-09-24‎@markiplier Were you too loud or what? Lmao
2014-09-24‎@freakshow180 What are you smoking?
2014-09-24‎@imatu777 You were in it, smartass.
2014-09-24‎@freakshow180 Fire away.
2014-09-24‎I haven't felt this tired in forever. It's as if the pressure being off from work just shut me down...I don't even know if that was English.
2014-09-24‎RT @_Omg_Haley_: Had lots of fun chatting with @PioneersProd and @sammy_botkin we should do the chat thing more often

2014-09-24‎@markiplier You have to buy me dinner first..
2014-09-24‎@_Omg_Haley_ Oh I will do it. I'll do it SO HARD  ;D
2014-09-23‎Also leaving for a 4 day vacation to Texas on Friday, so really need to get as much stuff done as I can. I'll stream tomorrow evening.
2014-09-23‎I've just been all over the place these last 2 weeks. Haven't had a day off since Wednesday so I'm really wiped out.
2014-09-23‎I'll be doing a Live stream TOMORROW night. Expected to do it now but I'm just worn out. Haven't had a decent night's sleep in forever.

2014-09-23‎@MRSANPRODHD22 I've been worse, so not too bad I guess =)
2014-09-22‎And obviously there will be more footage from the 2008-2009 periods since @Nighty74 recovered those for me  =)
2014-09-22‎All of the 6 year portions are going to be taken out, so it won't matter what time period it's viewed in.
2014-09-22‎"Also will add a brief segment on ""Extinction"". The ending will be a little different though since it's no longer for the 6 year anniversary."
2014-09-22‎The Anthology is almost done. Just need to recreate the transition segments between the years. Everything's been remixed and cleaned up.
2014-09-22‎@MRSANPRODHD22 Hey there :D
2014-09-22‎@makemebad35 And I'd love for you to shut up ~_~
2014-09-22‎It feels like Fall. Ughhh...
2014-09-22‎@TheArchfiend I gotta say, as much as I hate the Redskins, I don't mind Cousins. I'm sure I'll be rewording that when Dallas plays them....

2014-09-22‎People are out there trying to solve the problems of the world and here I am debating what to have for dinner for the last 20 minutes.
2014-09-22‎@sammy_botkin I'm still mixed on that one. It stopped being scary since I died so frequently. I loved the atmosphere and facility though.
2014-09-22‎@_Omg_Haley_ Probably 7:30. I'll definitely be on for a while.
2014-09-22‎@_Omg_Haley_ haha I was doing anything to stay awake. Tuesday stream might be just as long.
2014-09-21‎@imatu777 That's awful =(

2014-09-20‎@twwc960 If you're living life the way someone tells you to, you're not living at all.
2014-09-20‎When I think about it, I couldn't picture a better fanbase. There's rarely fights or negativity or anything. Not having mixed is unheard of.
2014-09-20‎And honestly, I dread what life will be like in 100 years.
2014-09-20‎Theres too much negativity in the world anymore. This generation quite honestly is atrocious to me. We've strayed so far from simple things.
2014-09-20‎I won't lie that there's hidden symbolism and messages in my videos this past year. But I really want you to know how much I love you guys.
2014-09-20‎Express enough. You are all the friends I never had or wish I could've had. This fanbase is a gift, and I really wish it could be bigger.
2014-09-20‎But as time goes on it gets progressively worse. It's not just from my job but life in general. You guys mean the world to me which I can't
2014-09-20‎The Internet has been what's kept me motivated to keep trying my best, and without it, I couldn't even imagine.
2014-09-20‎There's so much on my mind right now that my mind can't process it.
2014-09-20‎@sammy_botkin God I hate that song.
2014-09-19‎"Idk why but I like to listen to ""Eet"" when I'm tired, have a head ache, etc. Very soothing track."
2014-09-19‎@imatu777 ~_~
2014-09-19‎@twwc960 I could really go for one of those right now.
2014-09-19‎@imatu777 I wish it were a simpler procedure. I'll get the full scoop in two weeks when I head to Philadelphia. See what can be done.
2014-09-19‎"@sammy_botkin My life hasn't been ""normal"" since 2012 ended. If these are just speed bumps they're pretty damn big ones.."
2014-09-19‎@sammy_botkin I swear life anymore is a step forward and then two steps back. I really don't understand why all of this is happening.
2014-09-19‎@sammy_botkin I'll barely be able to edit videos, play Xbox, etc. Literally will have one hand for months. I'll just be sitting around.
2014-09-19‎@freakshow180 No..
2014-09-19‎@twwc960 Yeah, I was taking about why I can't get it done immediately. My fault.
2014-09-19‎@twwc960 Well I didn't even start yet, that's the thing. I can't get employed, not even work a day and take 3 months off.
2014-09-19‎So my finger is going to be messed up until around March 2015. I..FUCKED..UP...BAD...
2014-09-19‎All from a fucking YouTube video. Good god that is ridiculous....I can't believe this is happening....
2014-09-19‎So..when I get this surgery, my right hand will be immobilized for months. It could take 3 months to recover from that.
2014-09-19‎Sweet wow, Robbyn Kirmssé (Ember's singing voice) made this for my birthday. http://t.co/3GOI1oBdZe
2014-09-18‎@markiplier Good to hear! That's what social media is supposed to be used for. Not just to post but to interact with your viewers.  =)
2014-09-18‎I only mention this because I do get comments time to time on Instagram from people asking why I always look angry or insane in my pics.
2014-09-18‎I haven't smiled in a profile pic since February 2013.  o.0 http://t.co/q670hU4ty8
2014-09-18‎Ever notice how all of my profile pics in the last 2 years have not had smiles?
2014-09-18‎I don't smile...I just..don't for some reason. It goes back to 10th grade when I saw family photos of me and how I smiled. Idk why.
2014-09-18‎I can't remember the last time I smiled in one of my photos... http://t.co/gYt8eICkU5
2014-09-18‎Which also might have to push the surgery back even farther. I might have to wait until November to get this surgically repaired.
2014-09-18‎By then, it'll be 2 months since I tore it. The longer you wait, the more stretched apart it gets. If I get surgery on that, it could take

2014-09-18‎Really iOS? I pause you so I can Live stream for a few hours, resume and it starts all over again from 0 MB. Fucckkkk youuuu!
2014-09-18‎@imatu777 It was a last minute decision. Wasn't sure if I was gonna be out drinking or at the movies.

2014-09-18‎@sammy_botkin I know how desperately you wanted to catch one  =)  Glad you made it!
2014-09-18‎@_Omg_Haley_ They're usually a lot less boring than that. Especially since @imatu777 wasn't there. I was just so tired after today.

2014-09-17‎@sammy_botkin Tuesday's my last day of work until October 6th, so might do one that night. I leave on Friday morning through Monday.
2014-09-17‎@sammy_botkin When do you think you'll be getting it? I'll do one before I leave next week for Texas.
2014-09-17‎@_Omg_Haley_ Quite a while. Probably past 10.
2014-09-17‎@Takeabow_19 Thanks!  :D
2014-09-17‎So guess what? I need to have finger surgery after what happened filming Extinction. I tore a tendon in my finger. Happy birthday tooo meee!
2014-09-17‎@sammy_botkin With it being standard definition I was tired of just having black bars on the side. Thought you'd enjoy that  :D
2014-09-17‎@_Omg_Haley_ And yeah I really don't want to download that update. That will take me an eternity. I only 200 MBs availalble  X(
2014-09-17‎@_Omg_Haley_ Possibly. Going to the doctor's for my finger and then dinner. Maybe 8pm ET? We'll see.

2014-09-17‎My birthday so far has consisted of sitting at a hospital for an hour and a half, getting shots and background checks...fun....
2014-09-17‎Life goes so much faster the older you get. Thanks again  :D  There may be a Live stream later, still unsure.
2014-09-17‎I can't believe I'm 22 today. Thanks for all of the birthday wishes  =)  Seems like half a year ago I did shots for the first legal time.
2014-09-17‎@sammy_botkin Just said I went to all of the games. I don't self-promote like that lol
2014-09-17‎Holy shit. A guy in the waiting room at the hospital with me played for the Pioneers. o.0

2014-09-17‎@twwc960 I said on the side lol It's just going to be a long and painful month.
2014-09-17‎@_Omg_Haley_ Surgery is pretty much my biggest fear besides death. I mean, it's only on a finger but still...
2014-09-17‎Not to mention the possible finger surgery on the side. I think I'm going to die...
2014-09-17‎I need two TB shots, possibly a tetanus, a flu shot, and maybe a Hepatitis shot. Trying to kill me??
2014-09-17‎You have no idea how much of a pain in the ass it is getting employed at a hospital. Background checks, screenings, shots. My god...
2014-09-16‎Not sure if there will be a Live stream tomorrow. I'll keep you posted.
2014-09-16‎@twwc960 That's next week with my family doctor.
2014-09-16‎I never expected one of my birthday presents tomorrow to be a TB shot and a health physical. This hiring process is a pain in the ass.
2014-09-16‎Can I just sleep for the next week? Er..except for Wednesday? I'm tired of reality.
2014-09-16‎@makemebad35 I'm sorry lol but that tweet was great.

2014-09-16‎It won't have the same charm in filming like the Furby one. I had a whole week to myself back in 2012 to film that. Nonetheless..here we go.
2014-09-16‎My first night is October 6th. Being it's 2nd shift, I have the day time to shoot. So going to really try to plan this out.
2014-09-16‎Even if I have to block out the windows in the daytime I am going to find a way to shoot this to make up for last year's flop.
2014-09-16‎No promises but I will EVENTUALLY get this thing filmed. I have all of October before Halloween.

2014-09-15‎@sammy_botkin @_Omg_Haley_ You know..as much I love the pic, I wish one of you would change it. I can't distinguish, even with the names lol

2014-09-15‎"@sammy_botkin @_Omg_Haley_ MAKE SURE you hit the ""Download"" button. That audio player distorts it even more lol"
2014-09-15‎@freakshow180 It's really leveled out this time lol A very flat mix. Also being it's now single tracked being it's Live.
2014-09-15‎@_Omg_Haley_ @sammy_botkin In sync at bits. If I did it nowadays I'd probably make a much better version,minus the ending. The end was good.
2014-09-15‎@_Omg_Haley_ @sammy_botkin It really wasn't mixed/recorded well. Especially being it was pitched. Vocals harmonies distorted and weren't
2014-09-15‎@sammy_botkin That still should've been fixed. I'm really not up for re-recording that song though. Way too hard.
2014-09-15‎@sammy_botkin Then you're one of the very few that had the chance to download it lol It's long since been deleted from YouTube. There's bits
2014-09-15‎"Although, if you ask me, the ""I'm dead, there goes my head"" through the end of that original studio mix I did was the best I've ever sang."

2014-09-14‎@sammy_botkin @_Omg_Haley_ God dammit, it updated...
2014-09-14‎I really don't think that will ever go away. The worst is over but I still have periods where I really wish he was here.
2014-09-14‎At night I'm still looking down trying not to trip over him. When I open pretzels I keep waiting to hear him run to my room for them, etc.
2014-09-14‎I've long adjusted to him being gone but I still keep looking for him. It's hard being I've been conditioned to him for 12 years.
2014-09-14‎Can't believe it's been over a month without Bruno. I keep having dreams now and then of him. It's still weird without him around.
2014-09-14‎@sammy_botkin @_Omg_Haley_ It's still the Ember and Jenny pics on my phone. It never updates unless I shut it down.
2014-09-14‎It's insane how much I rely on it and how much WE rely on it every day. I can only imagine things 80 years from now.
2014-09-14‎Had consumed my life these last 6 years. I almost forget what life was like without Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, etc.
2014-09-14‎You know..I've used Twitter every day for the last 5 1/2 years and I can't live my life without it. I can't believe how much social media

2014-09-13‎I swear every video I want to do anymore is a big one. Just don't have the time to do them. It's a real shame =(
2014-09-13‎It's very unlikely it'll happen anytime soon.
2014-09-13‎I'm not going to shelve the idea though. I'll eventually try to shoot it. With shifts being 4pm-12:30am for full time
2014-09-13‎I can't even tell you how busy I'm going to be these next 3 weeks.
2014-09-13‎I know most of you won't mind but don't be shocked if there's no Halloween video this year.
2014-09-13‎I won't lie. One reason I'm waiting on shooting this big video is because my hair's too short.  ~_~

2014-09-13‎@_Omg_Haley_ @sammy_botkin You guys are ridiculous haha
2014-09-13‎@sammy_botkin How in gods name did you take the most useless image and make it funny? That was what, a second after I turned the camera on?
2014-09-13‎@sammy_botkin I couldn't think of the word. Meant more along the lines of your image.
2014-09-13‎@imatu777 Would've been a killer idea to release it to accompany the episode. But I guess Nick thought different.
2014-09-13‎@imatu777 Bottom line is we have it for free thanks to Robbyn just using it for portfolio (resumé) work. It still deserves a release though.
2014-09-13‎@imatu777 That's why it took so long. We never knew her name. That track was online in HD for 3 years.
2014-09-13‎@imatu777 The last year on it. I really don't think he cares to release it. Hell, Robbyn Kirmssé isn't even in the ending credits for it.
2014-09-13‎@imatu777 Robbyn referred me to Guy's Facebook but he never uses it. Really wanted the multitracks. Butch Hartman only responded once in

2014-09-12‎@imatu777 iTunes was already around then. But yeah it was in a web player. I have conspiracies on it lol I swear they purposely degraded it.
2014-09-12‎I'm not one to hold grudges but Guy...youuu blooow!  =P  I still won't rest until that song's on iTunes.
2014-09-12‎Having to listen to that god awful mix for 10 years (for me it was at least 4-6)...I have no idea how we did it.
2014-09-12‎It's been 5 months now since we found it and I'm still not over how pissed I am that Guy Moon released Remember in such awful quality.

2014-09-09‎@sammy_botkin Ah so thats why I've never seen you in streams. I'm going away shortly after then but I'll be sure to a stream before I leave.
2014-09-09‎@_Omg_Haley_ @sammy_botkin That's a shame  =(  You don't have a PC? Vaughn is the closest to what BlogTv was so I won't be changing sadly.

2014-09-09‎I won't be starting there until October 1st but it's going to be a huge breath of fresh air for me. It's a second shift position.

2014-09-07‎@MinnesotaBurns He's actually one of the top rated quarterbacks. He just can't win the big one. Especially with a terrible defense.

2014-09-07‎@TheArchfiend I'm dreading when we play you guys this season. Dallas will never be able to stop that fast paced offense.
2014-09-07‎Of course it's a TD. God...I'm starting to sound like @TheArchfiend now.
2014-09-07‎I'm about to turn this game off already....

2014-09-07‎FUUUUUUCCCKK!
2014-09-07‎Well at least the Redskins lost. Dallas, you better win or ima rage.
2014-09-07‎@imatu777 You're not a Cowboys fan. You wouldn't understand.

2014-08-30‎@twwc960 The programs I got, the less interested I was. Lots of pressure being the public would see all of the stuff you work on.
2014-08-30‎@twwc960 Sure college was a much smaller scale, but real world-wise, it's a lot of work. I just wasn't cut out for it, and the deeper into
2014-08-30‎@twwc960 Actually it's quite stressful. Production is very unpredictable. You have massive deadlines and little time to put together work.
2014-08-29‎Yes..I lied about college. I went for an MD  ~_~
2014-08-29‎I'd laugh if I just jinxed it and won't get hired after the interview next week.

2014-08-28‎I will also issue a select few on DVD ;D
2014-08-28‎Most likely will be available in a torrent file. The YouTube version had mistakes and degraded quality.

2014-08-27‎What would you rather out tomorrow? The outtakes or commentary for Extinction? Also have something else planned for Friday.
2014-08-27‎RT @imatu777: @PioneersProd We all die eventually =) Have a great day!
2014-08-27‎It's been a month and my finger is STILL sticking straight up from that Swiss Army knife. I'm going to die I guess.
2014-08-27‎Thanks for all of the positive comments on Extinction. It's nice knowing your hard work pays off.
2014-08-27‎I'll try to balance YouTube into it somehow. No idea how, but I'll try.
2014-08-27‎The only downside is it's really going to mess up my YouTube videos. That's another reason I've strayed away from looking for something.
2014-08-27‎Going to discuss about it. I'm not bringing it up again. Been struggling to find something since I graduated and this is the most logical.
2014-08-27‎@freakshow180 Because it's a fucking cat ~_~

2014-08-26‎@sonicfreak04 That'd be awesome to see! Go for it.
2014-08-26‎@sammy_botkin I was the same way. I felt like I never belonged with my grade. YouTube helped in my final two years of high school but still.
2014-08-26‎Those going back to school, I wish you the best of luck! :D
2014-08-26‎There's 3 songs I'd want played at my funeral. Remember, Bohemian Rhapsody, and the Golden Slumbers - The End medley from Abbey Road.
2014-08-26‎@freakshow180 @imatu777 What the hell??
2014-08-26‎That first week was the hardest. I feel like I'm 100% again, but it's still hard not seeing him anymore. Miss you buddy.
2014-08-26‎I still keep looking for him here and there. It's funny how conditioned you are when you have a pet. I am getting used to it though.
2014-08-26‎We got a heart warming card in the mail from the vet where Bruno was put to rest. I didn't expect that. Can't believe it's been 2 weeks.

2014-08-25‎@89Kris I mean, I'm used to it nowadays but I still hate it. It robbed YouTube of many things that made it great. It's still confusing too.
2014-08-25‎"@imatu777 Interesting theory...being they actually ""bled"" in Extinction, it shows they were actually alive. Or was that all in the mind?"

2014-08-25‎@imatu777 I really hope people enjoy both. The fan fiction is long. Uncut,it's 40 mins. I messed up a lot though since it was a lot to read.

2014-08-25‎This video is very different than what you're normally used to seeing from me. Expect some things to not make sense.

2014-08-16‎@imatu777 You're funny...
2014-08-16‎@sammy_botkin Just ask him out. There, now you have to because I told you to =P
2014-08-16‎Hoping I didn't do some permanent damage. I know I didn't break it. You'd know.
2014-08-16‎It still hurts in spots. The top half is dead. It just won't bend. No black and blue or swelling either. Wtf??
2014-08-16‎It's been almost 3 weeks since I filmed Extinction and I STILL can't bend my finger that got jammed with the Swiss Army knife.

2014-08-16‎@freakshow180 That's the strange thing about the Internet. Even though people come and go, you still think about them.
2014-08-16‎First video has over 50,000 views. Crazy, I say in a comment reply that I'd kill to do voice acting and boom, same day I get an offer.
2014-08-16‎I haven't said this yet, I actually got offered a voice over roll for a mini series on a YouTube channel. Still in the early stages but the
2014-08-16‎I'll say this until the day I die, @DrBrianMay is one of the most inspirational and motivational people on this planet.
2014-08-15‎Things will just be quieter on my social media.
2014-08-15‎I'm not gonna lie and say that I'm feeling better. It's going to take a long time for me to get past this.
2014-08-15‎Guys, I'm still not mentally well at this time. I really apologize that this is happening. The last thing I want is to avoid the Internet.
2014-08-15‎@sonicfreak04 It's only for PC. I played it last night. Scary as hell.
2014-08-15‎@_Omg_Haley_ It's felt like late September here lately. It blows. August is the dog days of summer. Where the heat??
2014-08-15‎@IsaacHarby A lot of you guys start early. I think some might've already started. It's crazy.
2014-08-15‎@imatu777 But I have a loving family and people who care about me, and thats all the matters. Sure I get down here and there, but it's life.
2014-08-15‎@imatu777 It's also the bitter reality of the world we live in, and how scary it can be being grown up. I'm in that transition now.
2014-08-15‎@imatu777 Everyone's different, man. Especially as you grow older, things change. Sometimes things change so fast that you can't handle it.
2014-08-15‎@sammy_botkin Ironic, the one time as of late that I was actually truly happy, being I got all of that Send Request footage.
2014-08-15‎@sammy_botkin Oh man...that's sad  =(  Life's crazy, that's all I can say. I've never gone from being so happy to complete despair so fast.
2014-08-15‎@sammy_botkin All I hear are occasional cars driving by or the wind blowing the leaves outside. It's just not the same.
2014-08-15‎@sammy_botkin Every subtle sound I keep thinking is Bruno. He was always making noise. As I've said, it's just too quiet anymore.
2014-08-15‎@imatu777 Everyone grieves in their own ways. My brother actually didn't even mention Bruno to me until today. It's already been 3 days.
2014-08-15‎@sammy_botkin I've kind of had a similar experience with it but it's really just my mind not being able to let him go.
2014-08-15‎@sammy_botkin I've heard stuff like this from someone before. How he lost his dog but he swore he always saw him around the house.
2014-08-15‎@imatu777 Weed is for losers.
2014-08-15‎It may sound silly but it's the truth. Miss you buddy.
2014-08-15‎I swear I just saw a representation of Bruno in one of the clouds in the night sky. The same face that I saw in a muffin this morning.
2014-08-14‎Extinction should be done and out within a week. Putting the finishing touches on it.
2014-08-14‎@JordanAdequate Anytime =)  Thanks, I appreciate it.
2014-08-14‎@ThatOneNugget Aw, thanks =)  That bottom left one is the most suiting. He always mooched for food lol

2014-08-14‎@KOlshefski Thanks, Kris.
2014-08-14‎@imatu777 And I remember that I made one for YouTube. I even have two pics from that video, but not the footage. It's a shame.
2014-08-14‎@imatu777 Alright, thanks for looking. I have those videos already. My dad's been looking all over for footage of him and Bruno in the pool.
2014-08-14‎But posting pics of Bruno always helps me reminisce on the memories we had. It's an easier way for me to cope with this.
2014-08-14‎I want to apologize if my social media has been really depressing lately. I know it's not something you want to constantly see in your feed.

2014-08-13‎@_Omg_Haley_ That no one really knows about but I think about death a LOT. It's not a good thing. I think about it every day.
2014-08-13‎@_Omg_Haley_ It's like I've said about myself before, if I could know when I'm going to die, I'd want to know. It's a dark side that I have
2014-08-13‎@imatu777 Watching those home movies, I don't even recognize the kid I was. I can't believe how different I am.
2014-08-13‎@imatu777 And that was 12 years ago already. Time has gone so fast. I even look at myself seeing how I've changed.
2014-08-13‎@imatu777 You were a young kid though, right? I mean, I was 9 when I lost Bentley (first dog). I just remember how I got word from my dad.
2014-08-13‎@_Omg_Haley_ That's awful. =(  I'd never be able to handle seeing my dog slowly suffer like that.
2014-08-13‎@imatu777 It was the closest thing I had that felt comforting like Bruno's fur coat. It helped get me to sleep.
2014-08-13‎@imatu777 Ironic..you know that stuffed dog I shoved in my face from blogtv? I had to sleep with it in my arms last night =(

2014-08-13‎Had it been long-term, I would be able to accept it easier; like if he had cancer and had a time table...this, it just happened...
2014-08-13‎I know dwelling on it doesn't help but this is still unbelievable to me. It's never going to feel real.

2014-08-12‎@JaggerLennon Thanks, man. It's hard but it wasn't the hardest decision I've had to make in my life. Appreciate it.
2014-08-12‎But I really want to thank you all for believing in me all these years. You've really changed the life of a quiet teenager.
2014-08-12‎I can't keep making videos talking to inanimate toys. That can only make people laugh. I need to move on.
2014-08-12‎I'll be 22 in a month and I'm heading nowhere. With YouTube, it's holding me back from following my own path.
2014-08-12‎I'm going to put my best work into these final three videos. Another main reason is I have to move onto better things in my personal life.
2014-08-12‎Something for a long term period, it's time to let it go. I'll always be on social media and Live stream, but the videos will be ending.
2014-08-12‎And the constant feelings of having to stay consistent and please everyone. It just isn't fun anymore.... If you have mixed feelings on

2014-08-12‎A span of 6-7 years that it's incredible. I feel like I've done everything that I've wanted and that it's time to move on.
2014-08-12‎And I'm not just saying this because of what happened yesterday. This has been on my mind for months now. I've done so much for YouTube over
2014-08-12‎And 2 other videos that will take months to produce, edit, finish. These 3 videos will most likely be the end for PioneersProductions.

2014-08-12‎You are all great, wonderful people, and never forget that. I just need to take things day by day, one step at a time.
2014-08-12‎Again, I really want to thank you guys for all of your kind words and support. Last night was the hardest I've had since probably 3rd grade.
2014-08-12‎@JaggerLennon We gave him a wonderful life. Sure I got fussy with him here and there, but he really was the best pet I've ever had.
2014-08-12‎@twwc960 That I do..that I do...but it's never easy when everyone is down. It was so eerily quiet today.
2014-08-12‎If you guys are here, really need as many digital hugs that you can give.
2014-08-12‎@DavidK23 Very nice thing to do, Dave. =)
2014-08-12‎I'm seriously losing it right now. I need to get off of the Internet for the night.
2014-08-12‎This has to be a dream...it just has to....
2014-08-12‎Well I finally broke down...Ohh man....this is so hard guys. It really is....  =(  I've never felt so alone.
2014-08-12‎@makemebad35 Happy for him, but it's so hard....My mind's not right. I've had so many kind messages today. It's going to take time...
2014-08-12‎@makemebad35 I'm trying, man. I need all of the digital hugs I can get right now. I seriously am losing it. Trying to stay busy and think
2014-08-12‎@twwc960 Bruno was that way with everything I ate lol Didn't matter what, he'd follow me. It happened all the time in his later years.
2014-08-12‎But I was never this close to someone or something like this. It's the worst I've ever felt in my life.
2014-08-12‎This is just unreal for me right now...I've never lost someone I've cared so much for in my life like this. I mean I've had relatives pass
2014-08-12‎I'll always miss him swatting at my leg, begging for junk food. Or poking his head through the slot in my computer chair, nudging to go out.
2014-08-12‎Sometimes he'd already be in my room waiting for me. Now he's not there...I seriously just half expected him there just now.
2014-08-12‎Always when I'd go downstairs for a soda or a beer, he'd always just pop up and follow me because he knew I was having pretzels.
2014-08-12‎God...it's just so weird. This seriously is going to take me forever to adjust to guys. Just the subtle simple things...
2014-08-12‎RT @freakshow180: You know, Bruno made a cameo in one of my videos. @pioneersprod http://t.co/cmmzbik9JY
2014-08-12‎@freakshow180 Yes, a commercial. The bloody tissue was made to stop cuts from bleeding instantly I think. It was done in a Billy Mays voice.
2014-08-12‎@freakshow180 His ass was the thumbnail I think lol That was back in 2008. I nearly forgot about that one.
2014-08-12‎I just saw two Bruno hairs floating in my kitchen....very funny Bruno...maybe you are still around.

2014-08-12‎Ember of light for me, and now that light's gone out.
2014-08-12‎Bruno to me, was someone who I could always speak my mind to. He was always there for me..even though he's a dog. He was a warm glowing
2014-08-12‎I just need to stay busy....I could only imagine had I lost a parent. I might never recover from a circumstance like that.
2014-08-12‎You guys have no idea how big a part of my life he was to me...I just feel nothing right now...no worries..no fears...just nothing....
2014-08-12‎Every subtle sound I hear, I keep thinking it's Bruno...I wish I could set back time and see him one more time...for closure...
2014-08-12‎It seriously feels like a flame died out inside of me. I know he was only a dog...but still. He seriously was my best friend.
2014-08-12‎"I can't emphasize how empty I feel right now...it's as if someone flipped a switch. I'm waiting to wake up from this ""dream""..but it's real."
2014-08-12‎I really do appreciate all of the support and kind words today everyone. Losing a pet is never easy but he was so much more than that to me.

2014-08-11‎@imatu777 I know. I hated it just when he'd have to go for a grooming for the afternoon, with it being how quiet the house was.
2014-08-11‎@sammy_botkin It's just so eerily quiet right now. All I hear is the wind blowing the leaves outside. It doesn't feel right at all.
2014-08-11‎@_Omg_Haley_ That's awful  =(  That was one of my biggest fears, being the one to find him like that. I'm sorry.
2014-08-11‎It's like, 12 years of memories GONE in an instant. I can't believe this......
2014-08-11‎It hasn't sunk in yet but when it does, it's going to be strange not having a dog around the house anymore.
2014-08-11‎Being he was getting in pretty rough shape with getting around and his heavy breathing. But man...this is hard.
2014-08-11‎The option but avoided it. I've been dreading this day for years now and it just happened like that. In a way, I'm actually happy for him

2014-08-10‎@MLAATRDude I'm really surprised it only lasted 3 seasons. Billy and Mandy made it to 6. Why not MLAATR?
2014-08-10‎Only downside is for the outtakes, it's all straight from the camera mics. So it's a bit muffled. Not impossible to hear though.
2014-08-10‎One go-pro could take 6+ hours to render. If you moved it in the editor, you'd have to render all over again. A reason I hate Final Cut 7.
2014-08-10‎That was one of the biggest mistakes I ever made when I helped edit this (not using the go-pro shots). They took forever to render.
2014-08-10‎We had go-pros on the guitars, on the stage floor, and a wide angled one out on the floor that hardly ever got used.
2014-08-10‎I'm editing an outtakes video and re-editing every song with additional camera angles that weren't even used. We were so pressed for time.
2014-08-10‎Little did I know this little show would change my life. Now having all of the footage in my hands, it's like a baby to me.
2014-08-10‎I could've risked running out of storage space that night. But the more the band played, the more I wanted to record lol

2014-08-09‎@makemebad35 It just lacks the excitement for me for some reason. Also because the teams don't really want to show anything yet.
2014-08-09‎@makemebad35 As much as I love football, I can never watch preseason. Watched Dallas for one drive (their only TD) and turned it off.
2014-08-08‎All I feel like doing tonight. http://t.co/oXb4YaLJqE
2014-08-08‎@sammy_botkin You'll love the behind the scenes stuff I recovered from the show. Even though the audio isn't crystal clear. It's good stuff.
2014-08-08‎I managed to get every shot from every camera. Terabyte drive, I love you.

2014-08-08‎@Nighty74 Actually guess right for which one I had used back in April.
2014-08-08‎@Nighty74 It was a messy operation but yes! They're installing new Macs so mine was unplugged. Had to dig through the 3 unplugged ones but
2014-08-08‎Where the magic happened. http://t.co/gzLutbfFOn
2014-08-08‎For the DVDs and digital release  ;D
2014-08-08‎Much footage that I never knew got recorded. Even another take from a song that I didn't know was done twice. Expect something special
2014-08-08‎Wow, so I went to my old college campus to get the raw footage from the Send Request on Interview show that I helped shoot, and there's so
2014-08-08‎@sammy_botkin Love it!  =)
2014-08-08‎@sammy_botkin People always send me fancy stuff like that lol I always just like the original cartoons. Not sexified fan arts.
2014-08-08‎@sammy_botkin No...
2014-08-08‎@freakshow180 Now being nearly 22, life's starting to creep up on me. Also being done with college. Things will get better. Just need time.
2014-08-08‎@freakshow180 I shouldn't say that I'm not happy, I'm really just bored with my life. I've done the same thing for the last 4-6 years.
2014-08-08‎@MuscleRyan Try clicking a lot in the comments box for ten seconds. It happens to me too.
2014-08-08‎@freakshow180 I think I just need to stop pushing myself so hard for YouTube. It's not going anywhere. I just need to be happier.
2014-08-08‎@freakshow180 Staying consistent, finding time to film content, etc. I've gotten farther than I ever could've imagined.
2014-08-08‎@freakshow180 It's a mixture of things. The desire to keep climbing the charts but failing to move forward, satisfying your audience,
2014-08-07‎I want to send a huge personal thank you to David, Damian, Hobo, Hawk, Vcard, &amp; Alicia for all of the memories, laughs, and ridiculousness.
2014-08-07‎The gaming videos just don't make up for the amount of time I put into them. I'll still be on Xbox, just not recording everything.
2014-08-07‎Some of you might not care but I've decided to shut down the gaming channel. The main channel is what got me to where I am today
2014-08-07‎@imatu777 Yeah, print on demand. Could be fake stereo on iTunes for all I know. Sounds better than the DVDs though.
2014-08-07‎How I feel today ~_~ http://t.co/nqtZAPYI5d
2014-08-07‎@freakshow180 I miss that game. I don't miss buying a million different expansion packs though X(
2014-08-07‎@TheStupidWizard I'm the same way, man. I can't get up for the life of me.
2014-08-07‎Expect to see that intro in every main channel video here on out though. It'll be shortened obviously since it's over a minute long.
2014-08-07‎@imatu777 The questions only pertain to YouTube.
2014-08-07‎So I'll give a pass on that question if you answered wrong lol
2014-08-07‎I've only used the intro for the Anthology and my channel trailer so far, but Jenny's only appeared in the channel trailer version.
2014-08-07‎"There's a ""brief"" clip from My Life as a Teenage Robot in my intro, if your eyes can process it fast enough."
2014-08-07‎Wow, I actually have another question that was technically wrong. The one dealing with cartoons being referenced. http://t.co/Z1bPKKrrhq
2014-08-07‎I think I just discovered the meaning of my life...
2014-08-07‎@MuscleRyan I'm not lonely though. People have a hard time understanding that for some reason. Frustrated, sure. I need a change in my life.
2014-08-07‎@imatu777 @twwc960 Hey now, that last question could've been any of them. I thought it was rigged for all of them to be right lol
2014-08-07‎RT @imatu777: @PioneersProd holy shit I got a 90 on the super hard quiz. A few were guesses and I didn't know the origins of the frog, but …
2014-08-07‎@imatu777 I don't need alcohol to make entertaining content. It's just not good for your image. Parties are fine, but not sitting alone.
2014-08-07‎@imatu777 I mean, the gaming videos were okay but the Live streams weren't. That's when I really vented and seemed depressed.
2014-08-07‎@imatu777 That last stream was it. I was up until 6am just begging for it to stop. Even if people find it entertaining, I don't.
2014-08-07‎@imatu777 No more drunk videos, streams, or anything like that. Also regret having to sit and wait 2 hours to sleep from the room spinning.
2014-08-07‎@imatu777 I'm actually making it a point to stop drinking large quantities of alcohol, unless I'm at a party. I don't like how I act.
2014-08-07‎@twwc960 Funny...you did that viewer crush one on purpose didn't you? You knew I'd pick Ryan. Also got the last one wrong.
2014-08-07‎@imatu777 The gaming one had a mistake. It was PioneersGaming, not horror. So most likely you got a 90.
2014-08-07‎@freakshow180 How the hell did you remember the Fatass ordeal? That was 5 1/2 years ago.
2014-08-07‎RT @freakshow180: Randy quiz (more obscure questions)  http://t.co/wqOinGzdqG @PioneersProd

2014-08-07‎RT @MuscleRyan: @PioneersProd You are evil! Pure EVIL I tell you! It's things like this that make kids score low on their SATs!
2014-08-07‎@twwc960 Yeah my fault. It's a mess when comparing the gaming channels.
2014-08-07‎@freakshow180 Because the gaming channel I have now wasn't the original. So it get's confusing with the whole Google+ username.
2014-08-07‎@freakshow180 Of course lol And my bad on the gaming question. That was a messy operation back then getting the gaming channel networked.
2014-08-07‎"Uh oh...I fucked up one question. The gaming channel was originally ""PioneersGaming"", not ""PioneersHorror"". My bad guys..."
2014-08-07‎@twwc960 Some of them are tricky. I bet I stumped you on the earlier stuff or the beer questions.
2014-08-07‎I'd actually like to see one of you make one about my videos and try to stump me. I'm talking insanely hard.
2014-08-07‎Just made to be fun lol Interested in seeing the results.
2014-08-07‎If you fail any of these quizzes, I don't blame you. Some are purposely worded to be tricky and really require thought.
2014-08-06‎If you're feeling brave, try the super hard quiz - http://t.co/bD8Vz3ykxn
2014-08-06‎Making a super hard one now. If you failed the last one, there's no saving you on this one.  &gt;:D
2014-08-06‎How well do you know my videos? Try this moderate difficulty 10 question quiz ;D - http://t.co/fB78MAQbcj
2014-08-06‎@twwc960 haha I'll have to make a normal difficulty and an extreme quiz.
2014-08-06‎"Creating a PioneersProductions trivia quiz. Let's see how smart you are from ""newbie"" to ""superfan-ish"" =P"
2014-08-06‎@FeaturedDavid Looks great!
2014-08-06‎@XakatsukiFANX Thanks for checking it out :D
2014-08-06‎@twwc960 You were streaming? Daughh! How'd I not see the tweet?
2014-08-06‎@freakshow180 Don't forget the Furby.
2014-08-06‎About halfway done with Extinction. Turning out great so far. Expect it done next week.
2014-08-05‎@FNC That was the first website I ever used for Live streaming I believe. That was around six years ago. Real shame  =(
2014-08-05‎Might be able to go back tomorrow afternoon and get it. Wanted to be all cool and sneak in but that didn't work lol oh well.
2014-08-05‎It was so eerie. The campus was open, but the editing lab wasn't. So quiet that I could hear my footsteps echoing 100 ft down the halls.
2014-08-05‎Fuck, everything was locked. Youuu bastards!
2014-08-05‎About to engage in Operation Video Footage Recovery....wish me luck...I hope to make it out alive....
2014-08-05‎@imatu777 I did too XD
2014-08-05‎@makemebad35 It is funny to think that you've had the exact same cut for your entire YouTube career. I've gone through three in 6 years lol
2014-08-05‎If the footage miraculously isn't there...then...well fuck will I be disappointed.
2014-08-05‎In all seriousness though, if I do get this raw footage, I'll have something special planned for the Anthology DVDs.
2014-08-05‎If I don't make it out alive.....my legacy is on the internet...  =P
2014-08-05‎@freakshow180 Only downside is theres no soundtracks for the clips. It's all camera mic audio. The finished ones were mixed in a sound desk.
2014-08-05‎@freakshow180 You sneaky fucker...first the old videos from the torn down high school..now college software...you're getting good at this.
2014-08-05‎@freakshow180 But it's all raw footage. Probably 20+ GBs. I could never fit that on a flash drive lol I only had an 8 GB.
2014-08-05‎@freakshow180 But I want the raw stuff. There's other takes and bloopers that were never stored away. The only place is in that editing lab.
2014-08-05‎@freakshow180 The raw footage from the Send Request on Interview show that I helped film lol I have the finished music videos.
2014-08-05‎Final objective....retrieve all raw footage onto terabyte drive within 15 minutes and exit without incident...
2014-08-05‎Third objective...pray to god the editing lab isn't locked...if locked, spontaneously combust into a million pieces...
2014-08-05‎Second objective...avoid possible parking ticket violation for not having valid parking sticker on drivers side back window..
2014-08-05‎Crawl through ventilation and exit through roof, repelling down into parking lot and speed away....good luck agent...
2014-08-05‎Objective, go in, steal footage, exit without being seen....chances of being seen...about 35%. If seen, exit through emergency escape hatch.
2014-08-05‎Tomorrow we launch Operation Video Footage Recovery. Gonna feel so weird going back to campus not being a student anymore. Want dat footage!
2014-08-05‎@imatu777 @sammy_botkin It gets boring for me. Even when playing with friends. It's not my thing. Especially being it's all pixelated.
2014-08-05‎@imatu777 I feel like I wasted $20 on that game. Haven't touched it since I first played it like 3 months ago. Have to be up for it to play.
2014-08-05‎@MuscleRyan Everything lol Sodas, teas, fruit punch, you name it.
2014-08-05‎"I doubt any of you understood those retweets. If you did...you're one hardcore PioneersGaming fan lol ""Look at my stats""."
2014-08-05‎@_Omg_Haley_ I messaged the guy like two months after the video and never got a response. Messaged him again about 2 months ago. Nothing lol
2014-08-05‎"@_Omg_Haley_ If only that guy knew what was to come out of just saying those six words. ""Go look at my stats, man."" We still say today haha"
2014-08-05‎RT @_Omg_Haley_: @sammy_botkin just scared my brother so bad he cried CHECK OUT MY STATS
2014-08-05‎@sammy_botkin Are you serious? All from that video? lmfao!
2014-08-05‎@sammy_botkin @_Omg_Haley_ I had to send a screenshot of this to Alicia, David, and Hobo haha
2014-08-05‎@sammy_botkin @_Omg_Haley_ That video's a year old already. I can't believe that. Definitely in my top ten favorite moments lol
2014-08-04‎That might be why I'm so fucked up today.....
2014-08-04‎Anyone besides me mix every drink in the soda fountain together at Burger King as a kid? Must've done it 10 times.
2014-08-04‎@makemebad35 Or it could be completely harmless....I don't know snakes too well.
2014-08-04‎@makemebad35 Holy shit! You weren't kidding..that thing could fuck you up.
2014-08-04‎@LEFTY87_nate Welcome back :D
2014-08-04‎That footage is like a baby to me lol one of my favorite things I've ever helped film. Really hoping it's still there.
2014-08-04‎Will be my first time back there since May lol Gonna feel weird going in not being a student anymore.
2014-08-04‎Really have been wanting to get that footage back for a while. It's summer finals and doubt anyone will be up there in the evening.
2014-08-04‎There were other takes and bloopers that I never stored away. One day that stuff will get deleted off of the hard drive.
2014-08-04‎Going to go to my college campus tomorrow and try to steal back the Send Request raw footage from the Interview show. At least my footage.
2014-08-04‎@MuscleRyan Never got swollen or black and blue. Cut's almost gone. Had it started swelling I would've gone.
2014-08-04‎@MuscleRyan It's getting better. The pain is nowhere near as bad. Still can't bend it properly. It's just because of the area it got jammed.
2014-08-04‎@_Omg_Haley_ That's messed up. I wouldn't even let my dog out unattended with coyotes around.
2014-08-04‎@sammy_botkin I could make an hour long video on it, but also the Internet too. As much as I love it, it's ruining society to me; technology
2014-08-04‎@sammy_botkin I can't summarize everything in a tweet but to be brief, there's too much negativity out there anymore. Guns, war, racism, etc
2014-08-04‎@sammy_botkin There's just too many people in this world and it's only going to get bigger. I just hate people.
2014-08-04‎@CapmMeme That's the thing. I don't have a dream job besides wanting to just do YouTube videos lol I'm not interested in anything.
2014-08-04‎I just wish things were simpler. But I doubt that will ever happen =\
2014-08-04‎People say life and the world are a beautiful thing. That's far from the truth to me. It WAS once a beautiful thing. These days it's a mess.
2014-08-04‎Why couldn't life be simpler? All there is out there is a million problems waiting for you. I wish you didn't have to focus so much on time.
2014-08-04‎Just so much as standing outside hearing nothing but a few crickets in the warm air with a slight breeze on the green trees soothes me.
2014-08-04‎You know..it doesn't matter how stressed out I am or how down I am, nature relaxes me. I wish it could be summer forever.
2014-08-04‎@twwc960 Oh man I remember that one. Never saw the sequels.
2014-08-04‎I scared myself listening and watching playback of this stuff. I also worry how my subscribers are going to take this video. It's gruesome.
2014-08-04‎The dialogue and voice overs in this video are way over the top and brutal. I can't say brutal enough times describing this video.
2014-08-04‎Seriously, had I not had the windows closed the other day recording voice overs, my neighbors would've thought that I was getting murdered.

2014-08-04‎I know most of you could care less about the NFL....but prepare for another season of angry football tweets.
2014-08-04‎Of course I get the first overall pick in my Fantasy Football draft and I miss the first half hour of it. Autopick was generous for me.

2014-08-03‎@sammy_botkin I really feel like I'm missing out on this fan fic but my mind says to stay away lol
2014-08-03‎@imatu777 I've actually never seen that show lol
2014-08-03‎@freakshow180 Which was great. And then other shows like Catscratch...that one didn't last long lol 2006-present is when everything sucked.
2014-08-03‎@freakshow180 It's one of the last great Nickelodeon shows to me. Soon after than, things went downhill. You had Danny Phantom start
2014-08-03‎"@imatu777 Funny how you never mentioned her ever. One day I just post a pic of the DVDs and out of nowhere ""I wanted to fuck that robot""."

2014-08-03‎@imatu777 Which is crazy to think that I was 16 in my first year on YouTube. I looked 12.
2014-08-03‎@imatu777 I've gone through some stunning changes over the years. I don't even recognize myself from 6+ years ago. That me is dead.
2014-08-03‎I haven't tweeted today..I must be dead..

2014-08-01‎@_Omg_Haley_ That's one video I don't think I'll ever re-upload. I hope that somehow degrades itself into bootleg quality. Horrible video.
2014-08-01‎@freakshow180 @_Omg_Haley_ The commerical was WAY better than the original video. Idk which one she meant. I don't mind the commercial.
2014-08-01‎@_Omg_Haley_ Also funny that James is practically reacting to it in his profile picture in the top corner...
2014-08-01‎@_Omg_Haley_ Don't ever mention that video again... http://t.co/c5tdbS2flL
2014-08-01‎@_Omg_Haley_ It might get flagged anyways. I doubt I'd make it age restricted but there's a considerable amount of gore.
2014-08-01‎@sammy_botkin Ohhh god noo. Definitely not lol We'd have a serial killer in the making.
2014-08-01‎I went overkill with it. Even the voice acting. This video is seriously brutal. I'm going for it but I'm really shaky with this one.
2014-08-01‎I'm actually tempted to make it age restricted because of the violence. I mean..sure it's fake and dealing with toys..but still...

2014-07-31‎Bruno watching me edit. http://t.co/a0PDTV3DJL
2014-07-31‎@sammy_botkin I really hope you're kidding...I mean about being punched and kicked.
2014-07-31‎@_Omg_Haley_ It's dark. I haven't edited everything yet but looking at the raw footage, I can't wait to see what I make out of it.
2014-07-31‎How's your night going? Me? You know...just editing murder....
2014-07-30‎@Nighty74 Maybe you're a perfectionist lol I know I am.
2014-07-30‎Extinction Teaser Trailer - https://t.co/FWmTwS4ZEL  Coming soon...
2014-07-30‎For the first time since Alligator/Horse Head 2, I actually lost my voice. Literally could not yell anymore. Can't wait to edit this.
2014-07-30‎Still can't fully bend my finger either lol Uploading the teaser trailer now.
2014-07-30‎I gave this video everything I had yesterday. My neck is so sore from yelling so much. Still don't have my voice back yet.
2014-07-30‎@makemebad35 Stop...I want it too....
2014-07-30‎RT @freakshow180: @PioneersProd I'm bored and it's hot in my room and I'm listening to Flock of Seagulls and I played in preview http://t.c…
2014-07-30‎@FNC In a perfect world  =/
2014-07-30‎@JaggerLennon We'll go with production-wise.
2014-07-30‎I'll have a teaser out tomorrow for this video. I think this might be my best video since the Furby one, back in 2012.
2014-07-30‎"""Extinction"". Who lives? Who dies? Find out...soon.... http://t.co/WAd2TlISnL"
2014-07-30‎I really hope you guys enjoy this video. So much pain and misery went into this one. Might edit a teaser trailer for it for tomorrow.
2014-07-30‎Daughh! Must...edit...but pain's...too...much!
2014-07-30‎Ohhh the shit I do for you guys.....
2014-07-30‎This was right after it happened. That's all FAKE blood around it..ironic right? http://t.co/A4z6xaZnub
2014-07-30‎The good news is I got everything I needed shot today done. It wasn't worth it for that though. No swelling or anything...yet at least.
2014-07-30‎I thought I broke my finger. Hoping I just really jammed it. All on film and everything. Need to see the footage still.
2014-07-30‎For the first time filming a video I actually just seriously injured myself. Just put a gash in my finger. Hit the bone with the army knife.
2014-07-29‎@imatu777 @freakshow180 I got to chapter three and had to close the tab....
2014-07-29‎@sammy_botkin That's sort of how I came up with My COD Will Go On. I mention that on the DVD.
2014-07-29‎@sammy_botkin I do lol
2014-07-29‎@JaggerLennon Don't say that X(  Glad I'm done with school.
2014-07-29‎@best_fanpage_ I haven't recorded much of GTA lately but I love that mask lol Me and David both picked it.
2014-07-29‎@imatu777 Most of the other bands I have are just their hits or one hit wonders. Nothing in-depth. I try to branch out but haven't had luck.
2014-07-29‎@imatu777 I actually like a little of everything. Almost anything but rap. I've given it plenty of leeway but I can't get into it.
2014-07-29‎@imatu777 Very rare for someone to recommend a band/song to me and for me to like it.
2014-07-29‎@imatu777 I just have a strange taste in music. I'll never have hundreds of bands in my iTunes. I always discover my music myself.
2014-07-29‎There may be others I left out that just barely missed the top ten, but it's always changing. That's my regular top ten though.
2014-07-29‎@sammy_botkin It's REALLY close. But after all this time, I connect with Remember the most in my life. That song is my baby.
2014-07-29‎@sammy_botkin It was literally like a deadlock tie between that and Bohemian Rhapsody. In the end, I like Remember by about 0.001% more.

2014-07-29‎Earlier I asked what your top 5-10 favorite songs of all-time were. Here's mine.
2014-07-29‎@makemebad35 I hate the Geico and Progressive ads the most. Fuck Flo and that pig.
2014-07-29‎@sammy_botkin Things happen for a reason.....
2014-07-28‎What are your top 5-10 favorite songs of all-time? Tell me yours and I'll tell you mine in a few hours.
2014-07-28‎@JaggerLennon No lol
2014-07-28‎"My dad woke me up by poking me in the nose and said ""Let's go to Denny's""."
2014-07-28‎@sammy_botkin I wish most of my viewers were like you, Haley, James, and Imatu. They're just 3 of many, but you guys make my day.
2014-07-28‎"@sammy_botkin Over the years most viewers have just been ""there"" and not very interactive. You and others nowadays changed that."
2014-07-28‎@sammy_botkin I can't explain my gratitude for supporting me and my channel, Sammy. It blows my mind how dedicated some of my viewers are =)
2014-07-28‎@_Omg_Haley_ Like seriously blew a gasket in my mind. I've never had a feeling like that before or since. I literally lost it lol
2014-07-28‎@_Omg_Haley_ I think I cracked for a moment or two when I heard it for the first time. It was 3am. Still have the beer I had that night.
2014-07-28‎@_Omg_Haley_ Playing it, that's all that matters to me  =)
2014-07-28‎@_Omg_Haley_ In my life ever. Not many people understand my fascination with it, and probably never will. But as long as people keep
2014-07-28‎@_Omg_Haley_ On endless repeat. I can't even explain the feeling I had when I heard it for the first time in HD. One of the best moments
2014-07-28‎@_Omg_Haley_ The night I got word that song was found in HD, I literally played that song for an entire day or two with maybe one other song
2014-07-28‎RT @_Omg_Haley_: @PioneersProd iv had this song on repeat for 2 days now, no joke http://t.co/U23xhhBHpv
2014-07-28‎This is still one of the best videos ever made - https://t.co/wPC6Y9UIj9
2014-07-28‎@imatu777 If you say dope one more time, I'm gonna murder you.
2014-07-28‎@sammy_botkin I think I remember seeing Markiplier play that. Isn't it a pixelated horror game?
2014-07-28‎God damn you. I just downloaded the Destiny BETA and go to play and the BETA's over. I spent 12 hours downloading that shit =(
2014-07-28‎@sammy_botkin Wish I had an online store and everything but I don't see that ever happening..
2014-07-28‎RT @imatu777: alright dudes if you aren't getting @PioneersProd's anthology DVD i will put it in a torrent for you on this page http://t.co…
2014-07-28‎I'll be sure to get all content uploaded for digital downloads. Someone offered to upload the Anthology to a torrent, so it's all one file.
2014-07-28‎@imatu777 That'd be great since you'd have the physical file. Appreciate it  =)
2014-07-28‎@freakshow180 I need to find a good one. That smosh one is so generic that it's awful.
2014-07-28‎I never expected to get even 10 requests, got 3 times that. So thank you to those that were interested from day one up to today.
2014-07-28‎I never see YouTubers doing this, so I wanted to be generous. Wish there was an easier way but the digital download makes the most sense.
2014-07-28‎I'm not made of money  =/  Some of you have even offered to pay shipping, but I can't ask for money from you guys. This is a free gift.
2014-07-28‎I may do another wave in the future, but as for right now it's just for 12 people. I wish I could send one to everyone but unfortunately
2014-07-28‎Upload through the Internet.However, if someone out there has a killer internet speed &amp; could upload it on a mediafire page, that'd be great
2014-07-28‎Following shipping for the physical discs. Only thing is the full Anthology will have to be cut into parts. It's nearly 3 GBs which I can't
2014-07-28‎Okay so I had to limit the DVDs to 12 people. All of the content will be available for digital download without loss of quality immediately
2014-07-28‎@freakshow180 You forgot beanies  ;D
2014-07-28‎@imatu777 Never seen the Jason Goes to Hell deleted scenes though. That movie in general I could care less about.
2014-07-28‎@imatu777 I've been eager for a true quality version of the producer's cut. It's a better version for the most part. Not fond of the end.
2014-07-27‎@sammy_botkin Amber's pretty devoted....
2014-07-27‎@makemebad35 Funny, July 20th is national ice cream day...you missed out apparently..
2014-07-27‎RT @freakshow180: @PioneersProd *in a higher-pitched excited tone* Oooooooooooooooooooooooooohhh!!!!
2014-07-27‎Okayy...a girl working in the McDonalds drive-thru just gave me her number with my receipt. Uhhhh...what???!
2014-07-27‎These will be for 7 of my most devoted viewers.
2014-07-27‎I hope you understand. The content will be available for digital download though.
2014-07-27‎I don't post much about my personal life but I'm not making enough money to ship out all 30 or however many I expected to ship.
2014-07-27‎Hey guys, some of you may be disappointed, some might not mind but I'm only going to ship out 7 DVDs.
2014-07-27‎@freakshow180 Top secret indeed...
2014-07-27‎"@freakshow180 You know what's stuck in my head? ""Cukinn, cukin wit James""."
2014-07-26‎Wrong number, Richard.... http://t.co/xHBCVwHQAX
2014-07-26‎Blue skies and everything lol that was amazing.
2014-07-26‎I literally just saw three newspapers get picked up by a gust of wind that went a mile in the air. Literally as high as a balloon. Da fuck?!
2014-07-26‎@_Omg_Haley_ Don't ask why but Markiplier and Taco Bell go together perfectly for me. It's become my tradition...my ritual lol
2014-07-26‎@imatu777 He's always changing his name lol
2014-07-26‎@markiplier Nice. I love seeing you freaked out, submerged in those games haha
2014-07-25‎@freakshow180 I know him and don't even know what he's doing nowadays lol I drink with his mom at my uncle's parties, but always forget him.
2014-07-25‎@freakshow180 Whatever happened to Automobile? I think they died on the streets in Cleveland...
2014-07-25‎@freakshow180 I had a keyboard all through elementary/middle school. Then my mom sold it in like 9th grade. Wish I had it still.
2014-07-25‎@freakshow180 That's the downside. Equipment's expensive. I'm not looking to get serious with it or anything, but would be cool.
2014-07-25‎I think it helps make your work unique and more fun to work on. This video is pretty big compared to my usual stuff, so why not?
2014-07-25‎Also for one, I'm sick of Royalty Free music. Everyone always uses the same tracks. Why not compose your own  ;D
2014-07-25‎Making it a point to have 99% of the music in this video composed by me. Makes your videos that much more original.
2014-07-25‎I somehow managed in my crazy state of mind last night to compose two soundtracks for the new skit video...no idea how lol
2014-07-25‎@imatu777 I hated when I had 50 from the same three people within ten minutes lol
2014-07-25‎@LightningFlare1 Actually, Robbyn Kirmssé did the vocals. Very talented singer =)
2014-07-25‎@MuscleRyan It was from one of my gaming videos from COD Ghosts, back in like January.
2014-07-25‎@sammy_botkin You do realize David and Damian were talking about Bruno having sex with my mom..right?
2014-07-25‎Bohemian Rhapsody = SERIOUS BUSINESS! http://t.co/QuJDPOkiDi
2014-07-25‎@imatu777 @freakshow180 WHAT???!!!! WHAT IN GODS...NAME???

2014-07-25‎@imatu777 But you live and learn. I never re-uploaded it since I took down the Classics channel.
2014-07-25‎@imatu777 It my way of showing that through grade school I always got stuck with the unpopular kids and..the slow ones..bad idea to film it.
2014-07-24‎@imatu777 That peanut butter video is never to be brought up again.....
2014-07-24‎@imatu777 That wasn't an intro lmao
2014-07-24‎Forgot to mention, all new skits from now on will have title cards and an intro.
2014-07-24‎@freakshow180 That thumbnail for that PM video looks like I was bleeding from my face lol it was a shadow.
2014-07-24‎@Nighty74 Thanks  =)
2014-07-24‎I swear I'm gonna have throat nodes when I'm older from yelling so much these last 6 years...
2014-07-24‎Will still be a while before everything's filmed. Might be another week and a half.
2014-07-24‎Got about 1/3 to 1/4 of the new video shot today. Prepare for some dark lighting... http://t.co/1U44nFKkSo
2014-07-24‎Wtf....... - https://t.co/9sXpQ5FTF0
2014-07-24‎Damn you updates! http://t.co/UQAprmEyRF
2014-07-24‎@imatu777 It's a little slow for my liking, even if it is a Beatles cover. Not bad though. It's different.
2014-07-24‎@freakshow180 @331EROCK Wish I played the game as a kid. The Bohemian Rhapsody cover was the first one I saw &amp; my fav. Instantly subscribed.
2014-07-23‎Getting my metal on ;D @331EROCK Highly recommend checking out his covers - https://t.co/4V78cU39M4 http://t.co/IuxVFkKtoz
2014-07-23‎"The new skit video is called ""Extinction"". A video involving the death of a character...who could it be?"
2014-07-23‎I swear I thought I saw a ghost shadow last night lurk across my room. Hope it was my tired mind playing tricks on me...
2014-07-22‎There are still some videos that you've never seen being re-uploaded on this channel. Videos I've even forgot about.

2014-07-22‎@imatu777 @MuscleRyan I am going to murder this damn autocorrect!
2014-07-22‎@imatu777 @MuscleRyan I don't even remember saying that! That's not true. It was the beer taking..at least I hope...
2014-07-22‎@MuscleRyan Wait..what the fuck was that??? That was sooo not English...
2014-07-22‎@MuscleRyan I am going to pull your kick tour tweet in, Ryan....

2014-07-22‎@MuscleRyan I am going to kill you
2014-07-22‎@makemebad35 ...are you psychic or something? Me, @_Omg_Haley_ and @imatu777 were just talking about fears of spiders and bees...wtf??
2014-07-22‎@imatu777 Hollllyyy fuck! God...Great..now I'm paranoid about leaving drinks outside. Always been worried about something flying in it.
2014-07-22‎@_Omg_Haley_ That's awful lmao I've had a few crawl on my pants at work before. They're always in the cart bays outside. Hate them so much.
2014-07-22‎@imatu777 Also pissed in the yard once &amp; got stung twice immediately after. And got stung just closing the door in between my fingers. Ugh!
2014-07-22‎@imatu777 I've just always been afraid of them. Especially after one flew under my shorts &amp; stung me in like 1st grade, after going INSIDE.
2014-07-22‎@cinemassacre Best of luck, James! I can't believe it's finally premiering!
2014-07-22‎@_Omg_Haley_ Spiders are freaky but bees are the worst for me. Spiders can't fly after you and sting you. Wasps leave me cold.
2014-07-22‎Been 2 hours and that pic's STILL at the top of my feed XD Not sure if you've seen it or not. It's brutal.
2014-07-22‎Daughh! Someone please post an Instagram photo so I don't have to see @kungfualice's finger! Lol, please!
2014-07-21‎@imatu777 Keep dreaming ~_~

2014-07-20‎@imatu777 It sounds like a lame name for a bowling team or something.
2014-07-20‎@imatu777 I only said that once lol that was in the Draw My Life. I just refer to everyone as viewers.
2014-07-20‎@imatu777 @sammy_botkin @_Omg_Haley_ Well don't expect me to acknowledge it. I don't buy it.
2014-07-20‎@imatu777 @sammy_botkin @_Omg_Haley_ What I've used for everything since last year was EGS. That's even on the wristbands.
2014-07-20‎@imatu777 @sammy_botkin @_Omg_Haley_ I really don't see how Shimmy Jimmy relates at all to my stuff lol Doesn't fit.
2014-07-20‎@_Omg_Haley_ I hated that shot lol it looks fake. Fits the video though haha
2014-07-20‎Shit, I just realized the end of the video got cut off. Finished editing at 5am so chances for mistakes were very high lol Oh well.
2014-07-20‎"NEW video, ""The Search For Remember Bloopers"" - https://t.co/H2noybfqQ9  Been 3 1/2 months but still had my footage."

2014-07-20‎@sammy_botkin haha that was one of the first things that I ever recorded with the game capture. Still funny.
2014-07-20‎@imatu777 I did but idk if that was posted. Never be able to upload everything. It was like a 6 hour show. Plus no one will watch it all.
2014-07-20‎@imatu777 That was it. I still have the whole show in its entirety on my hard drive. I think I only uploaded one portion to YouTube though.

2014-07-20‎@freakshow180 I failed didn't I? Don't remember lol It was actually hard.
2014-07-20‎@imatu777 What the hell? I don't even remember that.

2014-07-20‎"@_Omg_Haley_ No lol I just wrote that for the video. I tried thinking of the most random things. The video was called ""I Have a Problem""."
2014-07-20‎@imatu777 @sammy_botkin @_Omg_Haley_ Guys, you know how I mentioned how I get stuck in convos on Vaughn? This is what I meant lmao
2014-07-20‎@MuscleRyan You wish....
2014-07-20‎Hopefully will film it this week. Expect it to be 10 - 12 mins long.
2014-07-20‎But some of you will never look at me the same way again. But it's a type of video that I've wanted to do for the longest time. It's brutal.
2014-07-20‎Some of you will be scared, some will laugh here &amp; there, and some will cry...yeah..you heard me...It's a mix of comedy, suspense, &amp; drama.
2014-07-20‎I just finished the script. This video might run pretty long, but it has to. Probably the best video I've written since the Furby video.
2014-07-20‎@sammy_botkin @imatu777 A girlfriend is the last thing I need in my life right now. All I need is me, my room, and Xbox. That's really it.
2014-07-20‎@sammy_botkin @imatu777 I never want to have kids. Perfectly fine by myself. Don't even really plan to get married either.
2014-07-20‎@makemebad35 I'm actually really interested in what happened. Ironic that you just made the Vlog about the ghost phone call.
2014-07-20‎@makemebad35 You should make a video about it. If you are being serious then that's messed up.If only you had the sleep talk recorder going!

2014-07-19‎So HOPEFULLY, things will be much faster for streaming and uploading, and of course, gaming.
2014-07-19‎Doing the speed test, I had a 0.32 mbps upload speed. The slightest thing would make me red bar on Xbox Live, etc.
2014-07-19‎It looks like I may FINALLY be getting better internet. Supposed to come on Monday. For the longest time I've had god awful internet.
2014-07-19‎@makemebad35 You're obviously jet lagged...
2014-07-19‎@twwc960 It will be a while before all of this gets shot and edited. Still got the DVDs on top of that.
2014-07-19‎This is gonna be a long video but I'm gonna do it..but I am legitimately being serious when I say I almost can't finish writing this.
2014-07-19‎"It's not ""sexual"" distrubing. It's not humorous. It's legit dark content. I've wanted to do serious vids more often..but this is pushing it."
2014-07-19‎@sammy_botkin It is....
2014-07-19‎@imatu777 @_Omg_Haley_ This is ten times worse....
2014-07-19‎By disturbing, I mean dark. I've never written anything like this before.
2014-07-19‎Like this is seriously BRUTAL....I might even get flags on this video...just because it's so disturbing...
2014-07-19‎My god...I almost can't even write this video...this is so wrong....I've never done anything like this before.
2014-07-19‎@freakshow180 I'm in the same boat. When I got some videos recovered I could remember some things as I watched, but still forgot a lot.
2014-07-19‎Thank You Guys  =) Read: http://t.co/nz9lXjp6fS
2014-07-19‎@freakshow180 Wow, I am going back...at the end of Evil Corporation Travel Agents a bunch of Fred videos appeared...
2014-07-19‎@freakshow180 I'm having an old videos marathon right now on Freakshow180Classic...I want to cry lol I can't believe how funny these are.

2014-07-18‎I scrapped the other idea I wrote. This is going to be disturbing..
2014-07-18‎This new video I'm writing..you may kill me..you may love me..you may hate me...this is actually pretty fucked up.

2014-07-18‎@sammy_botkin Just not going to be able to do videos that often.
2014-07-18‎@sammy_botkin But I'm not. I had to take that video down because people didn't read the description or hear what I had to say.
2014-07-18‎@imatu777 I can't believe you finally changed your profile pic.

2014-07-17‎@imatu777 That movie should never have been made. Im not big on it,not just b/c Michael Myers isnt in it. I bought for my collection though.
2014-07-17‎I ran, jumped out the window, landed head first in a pool, and pressed an Xbox power button on my shirt. Woke up. Suck it.
2014-07-17‎See, my mind prepares itself for when I have nightmares.Michael Myers randomly appeared with that scalpel tool or whatever from Halloween II
2014-07-17‎@makemebad35 This is first world problems with Damian  =P
2014-07-17‎First was The Brave Little Toaster, then Spongebob, Danny Phantom, Pokemon, and now this. God I love cartoons, even if I'm 21. Don't care.
2014-07-17‎I can't believe I forgot how funny My Life as a Teenage Robot was. Literally just bought all 3 seasons on DVD. What's wrong with me?

2014-07-16‎@best_fanpage_ Because I never want to give it away. Always want people to be eager for more, that way they stay interested.
2014-07-16‎Going to try and Live stream tomorrow night.

2014-07-15‎@sammy_botkin Yeah, still has 15 mins of exporting left. Probably be two hours before it's up. It's a 25 minute video.
2014-07-15‎"Going to upload the ""Lurking"" video now though, such a spooky concept for a game. Everything is visible only by sound."
2014-07-15‎Had time to record a lets play but not enough to film the new skit,so went for the game. Script is done though. Maybe Thursday I can shoot.
2014-07-15‎"So I just played the game ""Lurking""....holy hell...I got some of the best footage that I've ever had for a horror let's play."

2014-07-15‎@JaggerLennon haha good one
2014-07-15‎@freakshow180 Well to be technical Nickelodeon owns the rights to those shows. That network just makes them. So it'd be Nick's copyright.
2014-07-15‎This is a tricky video but it's flowing. Poking fun of myself big time in this one.
2014-07-15‎"They think I'm an ""animator""...I...what...all I've done is post clips from your shows lol What's interesting is they messaged me twice."
2014-07-15‎@imatu777 No copyright strikes. All I've posted is Danny Phantom and Brave Little Toaster videos. Neither ever gets copyrighted.
2014-07-15‎Obviously not going to do it but it is actually from their verified YouTube channel. That shocks me.
2014-07-15‎For those that don't know, they produce The Fairly Odd Parents, Danny Phantom, etc. That makes no sense to me. I'd get 70% of the revenue.
2014-07-15‎So Frederator wants my WorthlessToaster channel to join their network so they can pay me...wha...why? I'm uploading your copyrighted stuff..

2014-07-14‎@_Omg_Haley_ @sammy_botkin And that's what I had to edit with until we got the soundtracks WEEKS later. Very hard lol
2014-07-14‎@_Omg_Haley_ @sammy_botkin Gives you the idea though.I couldnt understand what they said most of the time,especially not knowing their stuff
2014-07-14‎@_Omg_Haley_ @sammy_botkin lol It's degraded a little worse than normal since it's mono. I accidentally muted the right channel back then.
2014-07-14‎@imatu777 Well that wouldn't be as entertaining lol How 'bout Kelly Pickler not knowing Hungary was a country? *facepalm*
2014-07-14‎"@sammy_botkin They recorded it &amp; mixed it afterwards &amp; made it sound like a ""studio"" recording. But we heard muffled words 90% of the time."
2014-07-14‎@sammy_botkin Only downside was, and Kris can vouch for me on this, the mic's were AWFUL. Most of what we heard was muffled.
2014-07-14‎"@sammy_botkin We filmed that at the end of March, so I'm ""still"" new to their stuff. But I had to put their stuff in my vids. Love it."
2014-07-14‎@sammy_botkin Now and then Aron, Jon, or Derek would drop in and see what we edited. I don't know them well or anything, just from the show.
2014-07-14‎@sammy_botkin Yes lol I didn't know who they were or how good they were though until afterword. Went in blind to their stuff.
2014-07-14‎@sammy_botkin Yeah lol so when you see these shots, those were me. One of my favorite things I've ever helped film. http://t.co/H11QwwBy0L
2014-07-14‎@sammy_botkin I edited Never Never, Anymore, and Comeback Song. Kris did the other two. Had a great crew.
2014-07-14‎@sammy_botkin Me, @KOlshefski, &amp; 2 others filmed &amp; edited those videos. There's 2 songs not on an EP yet there (Anymore, My Last Confession)
2014-07-14‎@sammy_botkin Not sure if you've seen it but this is where those music videos are from - https://t.co/AwWiFudasd

2014-07-14‎What's crazy is I've had it for over a year now. Still can't believe I made that out of just 30 layers (top half).
2014-07-14‎True fact, that emblem I made just out of pure imagination on Black Ops II. I didn't base it off of an image from Danny Phantom or anything.

2014-07-13‎@best_fanpage_ The multi-tracks will be on the DVD as well. It's such a small music piece but I love the shit out of it.
2014-07-13‎@best_fanpage_ Very rare but thats actually all composed by me. Added more synths for the DVD. Needed something to make it more atmospheric.
2014-07-13‎@_Omg_Haley_ That's insane...Could only imagine what was said lol probably gibberish.

2014-07-12‎Sadly he took his own life almost two years to the day.But the album is very peaceful to listen to &amp; was an inspiration for me composing it.

2014-07-09‎@imatu777 @sammy_botkin Only b/c she asked first. We're all just YouTubers. It doesn't matter who's more loyal or dedicated than the other.
2014-07-09‎@imatu777 @sammy_botkin Neither is better or worse than the other. It's just a mix of old and new. And yes, Sammy was first on the DVD list.
2014-07-09‎@imatu777 @sammy_botkin Nowadays, I'd say Sammy is the more up to date fan, making fan pages and art. Imatu has been storing videos.
2014-07-09‎@imatu777 @sammy_botkin To be fair, you have to consider different time periods. Imatu was first (2010 or so), Sammy..not sure about?

2014-07-09‎But I'm still HERE. I'm not going anywhere. There just won't be videos as often.
2014-07-09‎Had to make this video though. Being out of college, I need to make money. I can't make money off of YouTube and live. I make $8 a month.
2014-07-09‎When I can, or somehow get an idea, I'll try to do it. Things are just going to be slower. I'd never throw everything away.
2014-07-09‎I just won't be uploading like I used to. With my personal life consuming all of my time, videos won't be getting done as often.
2014-07-09‎In response to that video I just uploaded, I didn't expect everyone to sit through all 16 mins of it. I never said I was leaving altogether.
2014-07-09‎Leaving YouTube? What's Ahead? - https://t.co/LHPV4MU6XI

2014-07-09‎@89Kris Must have been a supercell storm.
2014-07-09‎@89Kris I don't know where it hit. Didn't even know it was gonna storm that bad. Never checked the radar or anything.
2014-07-09‎@makemebad35 Had 4 people over and just as they got here it went out lol was gonna have a bonfire. Still did, just got delayed.
2014-07-09‎@best_fanpage_ People do? I'd like to see one lol
2014-07-09‎Well last night was crazy...that storm was insane. Had a lot to drink lol
2014-07-09‎@sammy_botkin Heyy, that's my line  =P
2014-07-09‎@freakshow180 Guess it depends on the area. It was like a tornado went through my backyard. Trees were literally blowing over like dominoes.
2014-07-09‎Can't believe I got power back this fast. A big pine tree fell on the power lines at the end of my road. Thank you beer for passing time.
2014-07-09‎@freakshow180 Cremation? Actually, yes.
2014-07-09‎Burned by the fire. #drunk http://t.co/EeSrPhmqRw
2014-07-09‎Tree two. http://t.co/D8woRJb5u5
2014-07-09‎Tree one that fell. http://t.co/6sBYx7myUU
2014-07-09‎I literally just smacked shoulder first into my wall when the power came back. I didn't get to eat dinner. All I did was drink.
2014-07-09‎The power's back! Sweet mother of god.....
2014-07-09‎I'm going crazy. No power....drunk.....I'm so hot.....mother......
2014-07-09‎@MuscleRyan what?
2014-07-09‎Not sure those tweets sent. I've been drinking. No power.
2014-07-09‎Power'a been out for hours. Pretty sure we have had 80 mph winds. Two trees fell down.
2014-07-09‎Two trees just fell over in front of my house. Must've been 80 mph winds.
2014-07-08‎"RT @sammy_botkin: @PioneersProd Funny, because as soon as you tweeted that, a friend of mine said you were cute and I'm like, "" Sorry, he's…"
2014-07-08‎I have a date with beer tonight.
2014-07-08‎"NEW gaming video, ""Vanish"" -  http://t.co/VXUdnhhKKu I beat the updated version."
2014-07-08‎@NoahDubois lol I try to blast it now and then in populated areas as I drive by.
2014-07-08‎@sammy_botkin The Vanish video I'm guessing? Not tweeting it until tomorrow lol
2014-07-08‎I have had so little time to just sit down in front of a camera. This will hopefully answer a lot of questions.
2014-07-08‎I know it's late but going to have a video out Wednesday about the future and what's going on right now. Finally got to film it today.
2014-07-08‎Like my new shrine of junk food? I feel like a college roommate separating my shit so no one eats it XD http://t.co/IsMsLvqPQr

2014-07-07‎Sold out of DVDs. Thanks everyone who's been interested! No longer taking anymore requests. Still trying to find time to get Disc 2 done.

2014-07-07‎Been a while. Mario Party 2. http://t.co/e3l8jrDftm

2014-07-07‎@americnakatsuki I actually won't need the address until I'm ready to ship these out. Might be 2 more weeks. Some have given theirs however.
2014-07-07‎@sammy_botkin @imatu777 I have a cousin who has it, sadly. I think I actually removed the original video from YouTube altogether.
2014-07-07‎It..it can't be...@markiplier  BEAT...VANISH??! I...I think hell just froze over and shattered into a million pieces.... #markiplier
2014-07-07‎"@sammy_botkin @imatu777 NO! It absolutely doesn't! I wish that video could vanish for good lol By ""that video"" I mean the one I made."
2014-07-06‎@americnakatsuki Alright, you're number 36 ;D
2014-07-06‎So depending what number you are, the longer it will take sadly. Expecting all DVD sets shipped by September.
2014-07-06‎Still preparing content for Disc 2. Wristbands should get here on Tuesday. Only will be able to ship about 3-4 DVD sets a week.
2014-07-06‎If you haven't requested a free DVD of the Anthology, you better hurry. Only giving away 40. Now looking for 35. Must be from US/Canada.
2014-07-06‎Follow the PioneersProd fan twitter page @best_fanpage_
2014-07-06‎@Lanier3000 Will have a promo video out once everything's finished. Probably won't be until late August for me ship to all 40.Like 4 weekly.
2014-07-06‎@Lanier3000 Of course =)  You're number 35. Still have yet to film and add all of the content for disc 2. This will be a while still.
2014-07-06‎@Lanier3000 40 sets. The cutoff for the waiting list was 25. 26-40 is the second and last wave.
2014-07-06‎I'm going to make the cutoff for the DVDs at 40. This is a limited time thing, mainly since it's free. Have 34 now, cutting off at 40.
2014-07-06‎Hot tub, I am ready for you.
2014-07-05‎@best_fanpage_ I always put subtle hidden things in my videos ;D
2014-07-05‎"His gf just says, ""I love musiiic!"" Lmao"
2014-07-05‎"You know how I know my brother was drunker than I was last night? I blasted ""Remember"" driving him &amp; his gf home and he didn't say anything."
2014-07-05‎@makemebad35 Nice, a good bit of luck on Independence Day =)
2014-07-05‎Hope everyone had a fun 4th of July. Had a blast, even though there weren't any fireworks involved.
2014-07-05‎@makemebad35 bullshit, I swear you've seen one before.

2014-07-05‎No word of a lie. Been wanting to try pot for a while.

2014-07-04‎@raycassie710 Nice to have a fan girl. =)
2014-07-04‎@PolishMovieZoe Thanks!
2014-07-04‎@sammy_botkin You'd have a lot more had a kept the vlogs up. I don't consider them videos though. Impressive!

2014-07-04‎Pulled my iPhone out &amp; just as I pressed the home button to check the time, power to the entire supermarket went out for 10 seconds. I shit.
2014-07-04‎@sonicfreak04 Don't have any of those sadly.
2014-07-04‎You know why I hate holidays? Because I work every fuckin' one of 'em. It'll never be the same again.
2014-07-04‎@sonicfreak04 I've always had bottle rockets and M80s though. Love those things.
2014-07-04‎@sonicfreak04 Not big legit ones that shoot up in the sky, unless it's for a park something. My neighbors get them somehow.
2014-07-04‎"Happy 4th of July...even though it's one of the most overrated ""holidays"" to me. Go blow some shit up and have fun."
2014-07-04‎"Funny, that latest one ""Whoa"", I woke up literally a minute after I was talking. Rare for me to wake up afterwards."
2014-07-04‎Can't sleep? Listen to some of my new sleep talk recordings before they're on YouTube ;D - http://t.co/qrOz1WTKX2

2014-07-04‎@raycassie710 Love that game but man was it frustrating. Gave me a few good scares.
2014-07-04‎@sammy_botkin That's life, sadly =\  11th grade was when I really wanted out. College, I wanted out even sooner. School just wasn't for me.
2014-07-04‎@livinginthenorm And I never took back what I said, just didn't want a depressing video up for too long. I haven't watched it since.
2014-07-04‎@sammy_botkin It might seem like a long road but it goes by so fast once senior year starts.
2014-07-04‎@livinginthenorm I still have the video. Just forgot to mention it in the Anthology. Too much to cover.
2014-07-04‎It's so weird thinking that in Fall I'm not going to school. That's always what I dreaded about summer, counting down until hell returned.
2014-07-04‎@livinginthenorm Good eye.
2014-07-04‎@chunkenberry I thought you were going to pull them out?

2014-07-03‎....GOD DAMMIT! There's already a mistake! This was like the 5th time I've exported this video. Takes 8 hours to export. Daugh!
2014-07-03‎Now comes the hour and a half viewing of the Anthology to check for mistakes...this is the second time I've had to do it, daughh!
2014-07-03‎@mattmemelo Crazy thing is they're just a small local band. Blew me away hearing their stuff.
2014-07-03‎@mattmemelo Actually might. That Send Request band I've been promoting wants me to film them. Would be awesome.
2014-07-03‎@mattmemelo I still love that vid. It was just so random. Loved the music.
2014-07-03‎@mattmemelo that was one time lol I'll never forget that lmao
2014-07-03‎Soo...I'm pretty sure a guy just sent me a message on Xbox of him jerking off....
2014-07-03‎@sammy_botkin I've been wanting to take a gaming pic forever. So set the camera up and took a few.
2014-07-03‎@BigAndTuff Youu need to learn how to spell...
2014-07-03‎@makemebad35 There's your Halloween video for this year lol

2014-07-02‎@freakshow180 @chunkenberry I just....hahahahahahaha! I can't stop laughing at the pulling his teeth out tweet. No idea why it's that funny.
2014-07-02‎@freakshow180 I don't care what people say, your other twitter accounts make me laugh as if I were on drugs.
2014-07-02‎@MuscleRyan @imatu777 @freakshow180 Daughh! You're blowing me up! Lmao
2014-07-02‎@MuscleRyan @imatu777 You guys are blowing up my at replies with those old tweets lol
2014-07-02‎@makemebad35 What? I don't see how that can happen. That's crazy.
2014-07-01‎@makemebad35 I'm definitely staying away from you if I ever see you at a gathering. That's like the 4th time you've gotten sick. Get well.
2014-07-01‎Only downside is, most videos have been in the same area lol So this is tricky. I really want to try and do this, but will take forever.
2014-07-01‎"I've been in my videos. Like The Beatles did with ""Free as a Bird"". I've wanted to do this for years. So damn hard though."

2014-07-01‎@Sheboss_Jessy34 Also don't wake up until 12 or 1. Not because I'm lazy, I just physically can't get up early. Up until around 4am.
2014-07-01‎@Sheboss_Jessy34 Yeah, that's kind of where I'm headed. All of my shifts are afternoon into the night so I have zero time for YouTube stuff.
2014-07-01‎@Sheboss_Jessy34 That's how I try to look at it anymore. Well, shame you'll be missing it  =/  You haven't had the best luck catching me lol
2014-07-01‎@Sheboss_Jessy34 What the hell kind of shift is that??
2014-07-01‎@Sheboss_Jessy34 lol well I'll be on for a few hours, so you should catch me. It's so hard finding time anymore. Work has consumed me.
2014-07-01‎Looking to Live stream tonight around 7:30 ET - http://t.co/o0erwPJwxV  Will discuss the DVDs and other things.
2014-07-01‎If there are additional people who want this DVD set, I have a wait list set up for a 2nd wave. It just might be a while.
2014-07-01‎@Sheboss_Jessy34 I'm trying to do one tomorrow (Tuesday). My work schedule varies so much that YouTube stuff is random.
2014-07-01‎@freakshow180 There's just something about October that makes it work. I could never do a horror video any other time of year.
2014-07-01‎@freakshow180 Although I hate transitioning from summer to colder weather, I fucking love October for Halloween videos and horror movies.
2014-07-01‎@freakshow180 June's always my favorite. But now it's over =(
2014-07-01‎@ToxicxEternity So do you ;D
2014-07-01‎@Sheboss_Jessy34 And I know they won't mind not getting one. So if you're interested, I can arrange for that  =)
2014-07-01‎@Sheboss_Jessy34 I can arrange to get you a wristband if you REALLY want it lol I had two guys I went to college with request the DVDs
2014-07-01‎DVDs SOLD OUT! Thanks guys, you're amazing! Never expected to have all 25 DVDs go in one day.
2014-07-01‎@Sheboss_Jessy34 You got it  =)  You're the last one. Close call lol
2014-07-01‎ONLY ONE DVD LEFT IN STOCK! WHO WANTS IT?!
2014-07-01‎......make that 1 left....
2014-07-01‎I have some people request that I don't really know through Facebook and they could be overseas. Not sure, so things may change.
2014-07-01‎Alright, down to 23/25 DVDs requested. Only two left in stock! Keep in mind, I'm only shipping to the United States/Canada.
2014-07-01‎@badassgamer397 I know lol Never expected to sell this many. Who would turn down free stuff though? lol
2014-07-01‎@badassgamer397 Alright, you'll still get the wristband. I'm dumb for forgetting you requested before.So many submissions losing my mind lol
2014-07-01‎@badassgamer397 Just realized, were you interested in getting the free Anthology DVD? Wanted to ask before they were sold out.
2014-07-01‎"Also sorry for blowing your Twitter feeds up lol Didn't expect this many to ""sell"" this quickly."
2014-07-01‎The 20th submission has been recorded. Thanks guys! Still 5 DVDs left if anyone's interested. I expect them gone tomorrow.
2014-07-01‎RT @imatu777: @sammy_botkin @PioneersProd Well I'm not really one for accessories, but... Randy... could... could I fuck the wristband? Is …
2014-07-01‎@imatu777 Lol they come individually wrapped, so you can actually preserve it if you wanted to.
2014-07-01‎I've had to pay for all of this out of pocket lol so that's why there are some limitations with this stuff. It's all been worth it though =)
2014-07-01‎They're pricy so was limited to 20. I wish I could somehow make an online merch store and not worry about prices, but I'm just one guy  =/
2014-07-01‎RT @sammy_botkin: @PioneersProd  I'm never taking this wristband off.
2014-07-01‎I've ALWAYS worn a wristband and I never take them (it) off. Worn one for 3 straight years. So made one for the viewers that I'll also wear.
2014-07-01‎They've gone from the yellow Livestrong, to a blue/white one from my high school, to a custom one I made for Nathan Wills &amp; a friend I lost.
2014-07-01‎If you're wondering why a wristband, go back and watch all of my videos from 2010 and onward, I have a wristband on my left wrist.
2014-07-01‎@sammy_botkin Some require a minimum of 50, some even more. Found one that had a limit of 20 and their features were great.
2014-07-01‎@sammy_botkin 21 wristbands (20 for viewers, 1 for myself) cost me $45, and that's the cheapest I've seen out of the many custom sites.
2014-07-01‎@sammy_botkin The wristbands automatically come with the first 20 submissions, so yes  ;D  I bought 21 in total, mainly because it's pricy.
2014-07-01‎Thank you all for the requests so far! Didn't expect to get this many this fast.
2014-07-01‎Remember, I only have 25 DVDs (50 together) but it's a 2-disc set. Once I hit 25, I won't be giving any away for a while afterwards.
2014-07-01‎Only two slots left for the wrist bands. Have 18/25 but only have 20 wrist bands to give away.
2014-07-01‎RT @sammy_botkin: @PioneersProd but I'm still first😏
2014-07-01‎If it happens, I'll announce when the 25th person has submitted. Now up to 16.
2014-07-01‎@imatu777 If there are any others, they're stuck in internet quality forever then because I don't have them anywhere.
2014-07-01‎@imatu777 I only have four Point videos (Mysterious Car, Night Dodge Ball, Terrorists, and Flashlight Tag). You have the Ray Rybka ones lol
2014-07-01‎@sammy_botkin You got it  :D
2014-07-01‎@_Omg_Haley_ That's going to be on there no matter what. I consider that my best video  =)
2014-07-01‎However, is there anything special you'd want on the DVD? A specific video, soundtrack, etc? I can arrange for specific people.
2014-07-01‎@sammy_botkin I know =)  You're the first on the list haha
2014-07-01‎To request the DVD, just at reply me, message me on Facebook, or comment on the video - https://t.co/rWc0VOE8XV
2014-07-01‎@_Omg_Haley_ That's all you have to do is ask lol I already have you down. I'm shocked I got 10 so quick. With overseas, there's even more.
2014-07-01‎I'll figure something out, just may be a while.Also have to pay shipping for everyone as it is.This is a process lol Never done this before.
2014-07-01‎The last thing I'd want is to take money from those who offer to pay for the shipping. This is a free giveaway and that wouldn't be right.
2014-07-01‎Shipping overseas is the problem. Some of you are from Europe, Australia, etc, and I can't deal with pricy overseas shipping right now.
2014-07-01‎Still will be another few weeks before everything's ready though. Depending how many requests I get, I'll gladly make room for more.
2014-07-01‎So looks like I have 10 requests for DVDs already. Have 25 in stock for now. If you're interested, get your requests in.
2014-06-30‎Might try and stream tomorrow night.
2014-06-30‎So 20/25 DVDs will have wristbands. I'm going to keep track in order of comments on YouTube/Twitter/Facebook for order numbers.
2014-06-30‎Just a head's up, the wristbands are in a limited quantity and are limited time only. I only have 20 to give away.
2014-06-30‎NEW video, I'm giving away FREE DVDs of the PioneersProductions Anthology, along with some accessories! - https://t.co/rWc0VOE8XV
2014-06-30‎My brother's girlfriend just ran his foot over with the car hahahaha
2014-06-29‎A video will be out tomorrow discussing the DVDs.
2014-06-29‎"PioneersProductions Anthology Soundtrack ""Comeback Song"" - https://t.co/SJtfTZIBqN  Download the track on iTunes - http://t.co/eFn9tJDukc"
2014-06-28‎June's almost over already?? Noo!
2014-06-28‎@markiplier Happy birthday, man! Hope it's a great one. =)
2014-06-28‎But I'm still laughing over some of them. In the future, I pray to god they invent a way to record dreams. I'd KILL for that.
2014-06-28‎They were those outrageously random dreams that make no sense &amp; are extremely funny..minus one which was a nightmare. Rarely get nightmares.
2014-06-28‎So I guess Pabst is an acid beer when you drink it before sleeping. Rolling Rock tonight. So many messed up dreams last night lol
2014-06-28‎@freakshow180 That's awesome haha
2014-06-27‎I'm trying to get a video out about everything and the future to come but just haven't had the time to sit down and film for 15 mins.
2014-06-27‎@imatu777 I'll never throw everything away. That'd just be ludicrous.
2014-06-27‎"@imatu777 I'm not going to literally ""quit"" YouTube. Just not going to be my main priority."
2014-06-27‎I'll still try to get videos done but they won't be very consistent sadly. I'll still be here though, not going anywhere. Just slower vids.
2014-06-27‎Even gaming videos have decreased. Had to also buy ANOTHER terabyte drive to store stuff on.This Anthology series has been my BIG THANK YOU.
2014-06-27‎For 6 years I've poured most of my free time into YouTube related stuff. Things are going to be slower. I'll try to Live stream regularly.
2014-06-27‎YouTube hasn't even been my main priority lately, more just trying to live my life happier. Been making a lot more money as well.
2014-06-27‎So things are going to be changing here on out, as if I havent said that enough. Working almost full-time now so have less time for YouTube.
2014-06-27‎@smpfilms hahaha that was actually really good! That can get stuck in your head easily lol
2014-06-27‎Wow...messed up dreams last night. Beer before bed does wonders...
2014-06-27‎@Mario_Sierrra I know, I posted it on the Worthless Toaster channel. It's not officially released though. It's just from the singer's site.

2014-06-27‎@mattmemelo wtf is up with your ear??
2014-06-27‎I lose some here and there all the time but never that many. Usually around three a day, if that.
2014-06-27‎Doesn't matter much to me but thought it was odd that as soon as they updated things, I lost 200 exactly.
2014-06-27‎So did YouTube delete inactive accounts again with the new update they just put out? I lost 200 subscribers miraculously all at once.

2014-06-26‎@sammy_botkin For me though, the instant I saw my cousin playing it back in like 1999, I had to have it. Still is my favorite game.
2014-06-26‎@sammy_botkin Depends how old he is. Todays generation probably wont appreciate it like the N64 generation did. Things have changed so much.

2014-06-26‎I hope a lot of you are interfered in these free DVDs. I've spent so much time on this thing.
2014-06-26‎I've been editing this bastard for an entire month and it's finally finished. I must be dreaming. So much hard drive space was sacrificed.
2014-06-26‎A few changes are present on the DVD that aren't on YouTube. Audio corrections and other subtle things are different on the DVD version.
2014-06-26‎It's...finally...DONE! I don't see what more I can do to it. The Anthology DVD version is finished! http://t.co/iMqvBGDrKP

2014-06-25‎One major change these DVDs will have is audio. Going through each and every narration clip and changing the audio levels.
2014-06-25‎This is what the timeline looks like, about 95% finished. Need to add in images of '08/'09 still. http://t.co/sHmj4AjrZq
2014-06-25‎THAT'S why I never would've been able to upload the Anthology in one video. That would've taken me a week.
2014-06-25‎You've heard me bitch about my upload speed before. Guess what it is? 0.28 Mbps.....yyeahh......

2014-06-24‎So will be a while before I can ship all of this out there. This is a slow process lol Also gotta re-edit some things and fix mistakes.
2014-06-24‎I should have a video out by this weekend on the DVDs and such. The accessories won't arrive until around July 8th.
2014-06-24‎Scene selection is in the description as always so you can find yours (or if you just want to skim around). You're all awesome.Thanks again!

2014-06-24‎@sammy_botkin They just appear! I swear they come in through the air conditioner.
2014-06-24‎If I see one more goddamn lightning bug in my room tonight, I'm gonna rage.
2014-06-24‎@imatu777 Wow, it's actually 30 mins long. That's gonna be a bitch to upload. Imagine if I used all of your footage  =P
2014-06-24‎@imatu777 Viewer submissions will be up tomorrow. It's a 15 - 30 minute segment, so didn't include it in the 2014 bit. It's a bonus feature.

2014-06-24‎@sammy_botkin That took so long to record lol What was it, like 10 parts? Still one of, if not my favorite game to this day.
2014-06-24‎RT @sammy_botkin: The entire playlist for Pioneers Gaming Let's play for Banjo-Kazooie is a total of 5 hours. Don't mind if I do.
2014-06-24‎But, being a collector of horror movies...I can't....re...resist!
2014-06-24‎I can't believe I just bought Creepshow 3 on DVD. This is one of the worst horror movies...one of the worst movies in general ever made.
2014-06-23‎RT @sammy_botkin: Was I the only one singing along with the credits on the ending video for the Pioneers Productions Anthology?
2014-06-23‎@realhartman Impressed that you've kept the show running this long. You don't see too many kids shows lasting over 10 years.

2014-06-23‎The DVDs will have updated images for the older years (2008/2009), since @Nighty74 was so kind to share my old videos that were long lost.
2014-06-23‎It seemed like I'd never be able to say it but, the Anthology is finally finished. This has taken me a month to do. Exporting the final bit.
2014-06-23‎@makemebad35 I'm more afraid of just seeing a ghostly figure standing outside by the woods. And then try to avoid my inevitable doom.
2014-06-22‎RT @Nighty74: @PioneersProd Your work was worth it, it has been a great Anthology series (so far).
2014-06-22‎I could talk for 12 hours &amp; still have more to say.I think I filmed 10 hours of narration. Will have bonus stuff not seen on YouTube on DVD.
2014-06-22‎So I hope you really have enjoyed these segments. And there's obviously stuff I've left out or forgot. There's just so much to cover.
2014-06-22‎Almost done with the final portion of the Anthology. Should have it finished tonight and up tomorrow evening. This has taken so much work.
2014-06-22‎I'll have an update on the DVD giveaways soon. Discs arrived. Just waiting on one more accessory. Remember, this is all FREE  =)
2014-06-22‎@sammy_botkin Oh wow, you weren't kidding lol that's gotta be a tough job.

2014-06-22‎@FeaturedDavid Wait, you stopped? Haven't watched too many YouTube videos in the last month or so.
2014-06-21‎@takerclicker Six years is an eternity for a channel. There comes a time when you have to stop.
2014-06-21‎@takerclicker Doing them my whole life. I've done my part for YouTube and don't see what more I can do. I don't do it for money either.
2014-06-21‎@takerclicker How could I possibly get more subscribers than him? That was never the goal or the point. I do videos because I've enjoyed
2014-06-21‎@takerclicker Kiss my ass.
2014-06-21‎@takerclicker And this is from a guy who doesn't even upload videos. You try and do videos for 6 years and deal with the competition &amp; hate.

2014-06-11‎@Nighty74 I will for at least one. I watched a good bit of them already. Won't be able to download the ones you just sent for a few hours.
2014-06-11‎@Sheboss_Jessy34 You and me both, sister.
2014-06-11‎I gotta wake up in 3 hours. Yayy....
2014-06-11‎"Deleted the ""PioneersClassics"" channel. I'll be re-uploading anything old/copyrighted music to PioneersAnthology."
2014-06-11‎We all dread looking back on our old stuff, but these are long lost treasures; vids I haven't seen in 3-5 years.
2014-06-11‎I'll be uploading them to the Anthology channel once all the portions are finished. These are videos you've never really seen before.
2014-06-11‎So I recovered lots of my old videos from 2008/2009 from @Nighty74 and all I have to say is.....wow.....I was sooo different back then.
2014-06-11‎@makemebad35 Things are just gonna be so different. Especially when you move. 3 hour time difference too. If it's for the best, pursue it =)
2014-06-11‎@makemebad35 I don't know when you're talking about, sadly  =(  You haven't been playing that much lately. Wish we'd known. Idk what to say.
2014-06-11‎@makemebad35 Are you kidding me? Holly........I swear you two were meant to be together. That's a shame, man =(
2014-06-10‎@twwc960 Ohhh gooooddd......I forgot about that. My COD Will Go On.
2014-06-10‎So my mom was asking what and why I was singing so loud last night...What was it? Don't Stop Me Now and Bohemian Rhapsody?
2014-06-10‎@markiplier Period of time. Many would dream to be as awesome as you are. Stay positive and keep doing what you do best  :D
2014-06-10‎@markiplier After all you've done, don't think for a second that we'll give up on you. You've done so many great things in a very short
2014-06-10‎@markiplier People always change with time, no ones the same person they were two years ago, even a year ago. We're people &amp; make mistakes.
2014-06-10‎@markiplier Mark, you're one of the nicest, kindest YouTuber's I've seen. Especially how much charity you raise, you're still the best.  =)
2014-06-10‎@imatu777 I hate that video, particularly that part lol And I guess arguably true. I don't remember Paint that much.

2014-06-10‎@sammy_botkin lol your birthday's 5 days after mine; the 17th  ;D
2014-06-10‎Expect Anthology parts 2 and 3 today. Gonna work on uploading those shortly.
2014-06-10‎@DustyTymes Probably was because I was really close to the mic. Before that though, yeah lol I'm just naturally loud.
2014-06-10‎@sammy_botkin Well real shame you missed it  =/  I'll try to do another one within the next two weeks. I don't stream as often as I'd like.
2014-06-10‎Thanks for 6 great years everyone! The Live stream was crazy fun. Love you all.  =)
2014-06-10‎@DustyTymes 5 1/2 hours.
2014-06-10‎@sammy_botkin Noo!
2014-06-09‎LIVE NOW on Vaughn - http://t.co/12OB1SjhjB  Come celebrate 6 years of PioneersProductions  :D
2014-06-09‎@freakshow180 I never do it without you  =)
2014-06-09‎Don't forget, the live stream starts around 7:30pm ET - http://t.co/12OB1SjhjB  Expect to be on until at least midnight.
2014-06-09‎I'll try to get these videos uploaded sometime. They don't have sound though. I audioswapped them back then because of music.
2014-06-09‎@twwc960 Fred's six. Nowhere near close to being a man. He's also gay  =P
2014-06-09‎"My first video I ever uploaded to PioneersProductions, 6 years ago today (""The Burglar""). Thanks @Nighty74! http://t.co/8c37EkCLAx"
2014-06-09‎@freakshow180 I won't get as smashed like last time. I had 6/7 before I got on the actual stream.
2014-06-09‎@MuscleRyan Oh god, Chip. He wasn't anything special. Just picture a manlier version of Fred.
2014-06-09‎@imatu777 Seems only fitting we discover this on the anniversary lol I about shit when I saw the pic.
2014-06-09‎@imatu777 I'll figure something out. Need the videos first though. Not sure how bad the quality drain will be but I could care less.
2014-06-09‎@freakshow180 I'll have to film my reaction to watching this stuff again after 4 years. Even if some are audio swapped.
2014-06-09‎RT @imatu777: @Nighty74 @PioneersProd Guys, I would just like to say that today is a GREAT day. Thank you both very much.
2014-06-09‎I'll try to get them out as bonus features for the Anthology. These are long lost treasures that I haven't even seen in years.
2014-06-09‎This is unbelievable, @Nighty74 has videos of me from 2008 stored that haven't been seen in 3-4 years, on my channel. Back in the Fred days.
2014-06-09‎@Nighty74 You have no idea how amazing this is. Those vids are god awful but have been lost for 3-4 years.
2014-06-09‎RT @Nighty74: @PioneersProd There is more ! http://t.co/nqKl5j1Lad
2014-06-09‎RT @Nighty74: @PioneersProd I  found my old laptop HDD in my basement. I haven´t used it since 2011 but it´s still working fine :-) http://…
2014-06-09‎@Nighty74 Those videos exist right now is on your laptop lol These are long lost treasures.
2014-06-09‎@Nighty74 I probably AudioSwapped it. I don't care, send me dat! Upload 11, 12, and 13 to a mediafire page or something. The only place
2014-06-09‎@Nighty74 You need to send me some of these. Imatu doesn't even have a select few of those stored away.
2014-06-09‎@Nighty74 Video 11, 12, and 13 are gold mines. 13 is the first video I ever uploaded (The Burglar). You are sitting on a small fortune.
2014-06-09‎@Nighty74 ..You...what???! You actually have the Jack video and the original Xmas one?!? SEND ME DAT SHIT!
2014-06-09‎@imatu777 And I can figure it out. Uploading the files lags the graphics. Might be a while but need to find DVDs and the size of the video.
2014-06-09‎@imatu777 It's mainly on just my channel in general. I hardly even mention the gaming channel. I could go on forever lol
2014-06-09‎I hope to one day when this thing is all uploaded and finished, to give out DVDs of it, for free.
2014-06-09‎Show for 2008 since I have little to no footage from those days. Blast dat music for dat intro!
2014-06-09‎For some reason YouTube made the graphics stutter/lag a bit, but it wasn't like that in the exported file. Anyways, there's not much I can
2014-06-09‎6 Years ago today I started PioneersProductions. Thank you all so much for an amazing ride.Part 1 of the Anthology - https://t.co/BDUkApSyBB

2014-06-08‎@sammy_botkin lol probably wouldn't make much sense would it?
2014-06-08‎RT @Lanier3000: @PioneersProd I'll drink to that!
2014-06-08‎@AaronFuckingB I actually don't drink that often lol
2014-06-08‎@imatu777 I only have 6  =P
2014-06-08‎Tomorrow night, you, me, and 6 beers for 6 years ;D
2014-06-08‎@thesquirrel1000 There is =)  probably around 7:30pm ET. There will be booze =P
2014-06-08‎@thesquirrel1000 It'll actually be 6 for me. I think I remember you telling me before that you joined the same day haha
2014-06-08‎@thesquirrel1000 YouTube must be down or something. That ain't right.
2014-06-08‎@thesquirrel1000 What da hell??!
2014-06-08‎@imatu777 &gt;:D
2014-06-08‎@imatu777 I'm just weird with music. Like I  have one song from tons of bands but not multiple songs. Mostly just hits. Rap's my least fav.
2014-06-08‎@imatu777 Great idea but I didn't really listen to music until like 2010. It's multiple genres though which helps.
2014-06-08‎@imatu777 Both Live and studio versions. And other music. I talk the entire time over it though, so it's not very audible.
2014-06-08‎@imatu777 Both are there but the Queen stuff is instrumental. There's a local band called Send Request in the bulk of the first half.
2014-06-08‎Videos will be uploaded HERE - https://t.co/HC9oXgeMJR  Had to make a new channel to avoid copyrights on music.
2014-06-08‎Altogether, it's about a 2 hour video. Also will have the Live stream tomorrow night, around 7:30pm ET.
2014-06-08‎Thursday (2011/Alligator Horse Head 2), Friday (2012), Saturday (2013), Sunday (2014/Viewer Submissions).
2014-06-08‎Here's the upload schedule this week. Monday (Intro/Inspiration/2008), Tuesday (2009/Mr Horse Head), Wednesday (2010/Alligator Horse Head)
2014-06-08‎I gotta get up at 6 tomorrow. Been staying up till 3/4, sleeping till 1 for the past two months. I think I'm going to die.....
2014-06-07‎Looks like I'll be uploading the Anthology in parts, once per day starting Monday - https://t.co/iu8vnwtyjJ
2014-06-07‎@thesquirrel1000 He mentioned it to me years ago but I can't remember. They're expensive though.
2014-06-07‎@thesquirrel1000 I did a tiny bit for How Is It Possible 2. They were Azden mic's but only recorded in mono. Not the greatest mic's.
2014-06-07‎@freakshow180 The pages aren't even folded at the staple. That's how untouched this thing is lol scanning it into my computer.
2014-06-07‎@freakshow180 Supposed to be here to be in it before college started but it never happened. So many funny things that never got filmed.
2014-06-07‎@freakshow180 It's practically the same as the finished version but there's so much more in there. Not sure if you remember, you were
2014-06-07‎@freakshow180 You won't believe this. I actually found the original Alligator/Horse Head 2 script that had you in it. http://t.co/eBSVFTUsQ1

2014-06-06‎LIVE show Monday night for the 6 year anniversary? Beer will be involved ;D
2014-06-06‎Happy Friday! http://t.co/RJfdk8Qm9Q
2014-06-06‎@sammy_botkin It took me two years or so to get into it. Was always into Fairly Odd Parents..until Poof showed up.
2014-06-06‎I'd kill to have it in one full video, but I can guarantee you that the file size is at least going to be 2 - 4 GBs. That'll never upload.
2014-06-06‎So Monday would be the Intro - 2008. Tuesday 2009. Wednesday 2010, and so on. It seems like the better bet. We'll see. Still editing.
2014-06-06‎"If it's enormous, I'll upload one portion each day throughout the week (June 9th - 15th). It could be ""Pioneers Week"" or something lol"
2014-06-06‎I think what I'm going to do is export this Anthology video into one FULL video and see how big the file is.
2014-06-05‎@thesquirrel1000 it's awful lol takes me probably 5 hours to upload a 500 MB file.
2014-06-05‎@thesquirrel1000 I'm expecting between 2 - 3 GBs. I might end up having to cut it into parts.
2014-06-05‎Used Motion 5 for the graphics. Nowhere near on par with After Effects. Probably wouldn't have this issue with AE. We shall see...
2014-06-05‎Really gonna depend how bad this gets drained when exporting. Not sure how big the file size of a 2 hour video's gonna be lol
2014-06-05‎"Every ""year"" has a graphic transition. The intro is all graphics, with a select few video clips. But the images stutter which blows."
2014-06-05‎"The only downside I see coming after this video's done is the graphic portions. They seem to ""stutter"" and lag exporting from Final Cut."
2014-06-05‎@AlonDan I cut it down to five. Camera zooms in passed them, so the one with the back turned would be in the way lol
2014-06-05‎@AlonDan Even though I'm practically giving myself a bj? hahaha
2014-06-05‎@imatu777 I already recut it and did the animation lol Would've been funny if I noticed after it was uploaded.
2014-06-05‎Trust me, I re-edited it immediately after I saw it lmao
2014-06-05‎Soo...I was gonna use this as part of the title for the Anthology video...until I realized how wrong it looks  XD http://t.co/ihHS4AKzAG
2014-06-05‎Here's a little sneak peak at the Anthology video. Expect this completed and uploaded June 9th; my 6th… http://t.co/uaRKbccXtU
2014-06-05‎@freakshow180 That's why I said it's too cliche. Spawns are randomized lol
2014-06-04‎@freakshow180 You might enjoy this. You're one of the worms lol - https://t.co/ZaLH8misRc
2014-06-04‎@smpfilms I still prefer you without it. You looked so much older with it.

2014-06-04‎Thanks to everyone who has sent in video submissions! All will be in the Anthology video. I'm about 90% done editing it.

2014-06-04‎@hawk4444 I've never seen it. I hear it's really good though. Only show I've been following is American Horror Story.
2014-06-04‎Guitar hero. Forgot about this pic. http://t.co/iNdtqlTLeJ
2014-06-04‎Can't believe I've been out 3 years already. Time's gone so fast.
2014-06-04‎At this time 3 years ago, me, @freakshow180, and others were sitting in the high school cafeteria during the graduation lock-in, reflecting.
2014-06-04‎NEW video! This game is insanely fun. So many funny moments captured playing this last night. Check it out. - https://t.co/ZaLH8misRc
2014-06-03‎Ughh, alright, I have to upload it later. I'll cut it down some more too. It was 18 mins long lol
2014-06-03‎Come on YouTube, this thing's been processing for 15 minutes. Stuck at 95%. Grr!
2014-06-03‎Video will be up in an hour. Some funny stuff in this one. Also a different game for once, so things are fresh (Worms 2).
2014-06-03‎Gonna try and get this Worms 2 Highlight video up today. Lots of good stuff.
2014-06-03‎@imatu777 I'd kill to put it on a DVD. It shouldn't be bigger than 2 GBs. Only issue is going to be uploading. I have awful upload speed.
2014-06-03‎Got some pretty funny stuff recorded last night on Worms 2. Never played the game before, so you can imagine.
2014-06-03‎@imatu777 I gotta see how big the file is going to be. Still more to edit. Probably just upload it on YouTube.
2014-06-03‎About to play Worms 2, this will be interesting...
2014-06-03‎@imatu777 Sooo all I have to say after watching those videos is...wow...Wtf lol
2014-06-03‎And yes, it will have some kickass music  ;D  Only downside is I have to upload it on a separate channel to avoid potential violations.
2014-06-03‎It's not just me sitting in a chair talking for 87 mins, it's a legit production. I've never done anything like this before.
2014-06-03‎I'm about 75% done editing it. Just need to add in videos/images/graphics to cut to while I'm talking.
2014-06-03‎It's set up like a documentary with an intro, body, and an ending. So this is as professional as Im ever going to be for a YouTube video lol
2014-06-03‎Going to be broken up like a DVD with chapter selections (years). So you can skip to any year you want from 2008 - 2014.
2014-06-03‎Ready for this? This Anthology video is 1 hr 27 mins of me. I have yet to add in the viewer submissions. This is a lot of stuff.

2014-06-02‎@imatu777 alright, thanks man.
2014-06-02‎@wearerocketboat Toast is good lol
2014-06-02‎Mostly everyone's asleep now so not sure why I'm tweeting this....
2014-06-02‎I made a lot of old videos public again. Mostly the older Horse Head videos. Some videos I had privatized that I don't remember privatizing.
2014-06-02‎Not sure if YouTube still does this but if you wake up to a bunch of videos from me in your sub box,my apologies. Made some old vids public.
2014-06-02‎I could've probably phrased that a little bit better...you guys are my life and what helps keep me sane. You're my everything.  =)
2014-06-02‎Lots of you have contributed which Im very thankful for =)  So many incredibly nice things were said. You guys really are my bread &amp; butter.
2014-06-02‎Trying to get this enormous video done for June 9th. Here's the video again if you've forgotten - https://t.co/t84YmPXx5H
2014-06-02‎Just a reminder that I need those Anthology video submissions by Tuesday if you're still interested in submitting.

2014-06-01‎Very strange day. My dad, who I've worked with and for the last 4 years got transferred today. It was his last day. Such a strange feeling.

2014-05-22‎And may be my time to move in a new direction. I doubt I'll ever truly leave YouTube though.
2014-05-22‎Sick and tired of seeing other users with practically no talent making a name for themselves. Especially let's players. Times have changed.
2014-05-22‎I don't even know how much longer I'll keep PioneersProductions going. I'm losing motivation to stay with it as time presses on.
2014-05-22‎This summer is going to play a huge role in deciding my future. I have no idea what's going to happen. All my life I've just passed through.
2014-05-22‎So I won't be consistent here on out (not that I have been the last two years). That goes for the gaming channel as well.
2014-05-22‎I have no ideas for any other videos in the meantime. I need to sort my life out and prepare for the real world.

2014-05-19‎More importantly the main channel, comments have gradually decreased. I get maybe one comment 1/5 days anymore. Something's not happening.
2014-05-19‎Even with Damian in some of them (gaming), nothing. I don't understand what it is. To me they're entertaining but don't even get 100 views.
2014-05-19‎I put so much time into YouTube but get little result. I don't even crack 1,000 views anymore. The gaming channel.....don't get me started.
2014-05-19‎I may be making too big a deal of this but it is something I'm seriously considering.

2014-05-18‎Not sure what more I can really accomplish on the Internet. All I've done is lived in the shadows of other users.
2014-05-18‎My minimal goal is 7 years, which is June 9th 2015. If things don't turn around much in the next full year, might call it quits.
2014-05-18‎Almost feel like my time on YouTube's diminishing. Like I've peaked. I don't know. Not sure how many more years I'll be doing videos.

2014-04-14‎If for whatever reason (and I can't see why), there are links in the description to download the song, acapella (vocals only) version
2014-04-14‎@_Haley_Torres_ The lyrics on their own are funny w/o the over the top singing haha Hard song to sing. Very high notes that kill your voice.
2014-04-14‎"This ""song"" pertains to my frustration on both COD Black Ops II and Ghosts."
2014-04-14‎I'd suggest NOT cranking the volume way up on it. I had to really deaden down the vocals or they'd clip a lot due to the metal track.

2014-04-01‎April Fools Day may in fact be the absolute worst holiday ever created.It's the one day of the year where you have to second-guess EVERYONE.

2014-04-01‎I swear it's so strange how I discover new bands I like. No one can ever refer me to a band, I have to physically stumble upon them.

2014-03-29‎@_Haley_Torres_ Maybe one day. But I'd change them around a bit to make them more original.

2014-03-19‎@realhartman Please, Butch? We have everything from Danny Phantom EXCEPT Ember's Remember song.
2014-03-19‎@MinnesotaBurns What inspired you to start a YouTube channel?
2014-03-18‎So is Titanfall really that awesome?

2014-03-15‎@MinnesotaBurns I still prefer BO2 over Ghosts.
2014-03-15‎@MinnesotaBurns You still play BO2? Awesome!
2014-03-14‎@realhartman It's been in lousy quality for so long. You can't even make out the backing track.
2014-03-14‎@twwc960 It doesnt mean theyre the way to go. Just depends on your needs like James said. A custom built PC could beat a Mac. Save money.
2014-03-14‎@twwc960 Once I switched from XP to Mac I never went back. Macs just seem sleeker and cleaner and faster to me. Just depends on your taste.

2014-03-14‎@freakshow180 I'll always be a Mac person. Just wish they were cheaper and more compatible with other things.
2014-03-14‎@freakshow180 Some people just criticize Macs because they're so expensive. When they break down though, getting parts is near impossible.
2014-03-14‎@freakshow180 I like them better but building your own PC is the way to go. When my Mac goes that'll probably be my best bet.
2014-03-14‎@freakshow180 Go to LCCC, all computers in the broadcast major are iMacs ;D

2014-03-12‎@89Kris I almost prefer Twitter over Facebook though since it's cleaner. Just wish there was a way to know how many people see your tweets.
2014-03-12‎@89Kris I get more replies on Facebook than Twitter. Twitter, people see what I post but there's no way for you to know unless they reply.

2014-03-04‎@freakshow180 No idea how but that track's stayed in my head somehow ever since my childhood. Powerful song.

2014-02-03‎@_MichaelFry I always wonder how many commercials never play. Think of how much money goes into getting your ad on the big game.
2014-02-03‎Props to Seattle though. They backed it up tonight. Just expected a much closer game than this. 43-8 is just unacceptable for a #SuperBowl.
2014-02-03‎@freakshow180 None stuck out really except the Budweiser puppy commercial and the Doritos ones. They seemed lazy this year.
2014-02-03‎@jfra I always forget how many Super Bowls they were in. Found it hard to believe they only won 2.
2014-02-03‎So now 9 out of the last 10 Super Bowl teams wearing white have won the Super Bowl.
2014-02-03‎@freakshow180 Those were the worst commercial's I've ever seen. At least 98% of them.

2014-01-14‎Of it I'd have to start over. Lost my raw files of everything which blows. No idea why I never saved them on that damn external drive.
2014-01-14‎Sucks, I have to re-edit my gaming intros and outros again from scratch since my hard drive's kaput. Even if I had the stuff ripped off
2014-01-14‎I want to start scripting again for my main channel but I'm just in love with doing gaming videos. What is wrong with my brain?!
2014-01-13‎The Seahawks/Broncos are trying to ban access to opposing teams fans for the title game next week. Didn't know you could do that...
2014-01-13‎@terlynn72 About time you got a Twitter =P
2014-01-13‎Need to stop staying up this late....
2014-01-12‎I hate you so much SF. SEA better destroy you next week.
2014-01-12‎@kierrrrrrr lmao
2014-01-12‎So @markiplier was in my dream driving my car somewhere. Wtf, Mark?
2014-01-12‎@makemebad35 I'm one of the few that actually likes Brady and the Pats lol spygate or not, liked them before it.
2014-01-12‎Looks like the Indy postseason drought at NE continues. Rooting for NE for the AFC.
2014-01-11‎From an iPod to the library because it fuckin synced my iPhone with the old backup, wiping everything up to date on it back to March 2013.
2014-01-11‎Downloaded music from iTunes/Amazon. So have to sift through it all and delete and re-add shit. Glad I found this app to transfer stuff
2014-01-11‎So glad I added music to my old iTouch, the backup wiped all of my music dating back to March 2013, which was before I actually legally
2014-01-11‎@Ninja_Somewhere funny, you're into tomorrow before I am at times.
2014-01-11‎Got some GTA V footage tonight. Looked at the clock and it's 4am, da fuq?!
2014-01-11‎@Sheboss_Jessy34 favoring 12 tweets? Lmao, I favor my own sometimes to remember them down the road.
2014-01-11‎Happy birthday, Butch Hartman! Hope it's a great one :D @realhartman!
2014-01-10‎My woes are finally done. There was a cable they didn't connect which is why I didn't have sound. So computer is FINALLY fixed. No charge.
2014-01-10‎I'm gonna murder someone...............................
2014-01-10‎OS Mavericks which probably did it based on all the forums. Either that or something got disconnected when they were repairing.
2014-01-10‎Great, gotta take the computer BACK. Absolutely no sound. Tried all of the troubleshooting steps and still nothing. They upgraded me to
2014-01-10‎It was a war dream; never have those. Looks like COD finally gave me a nightmare lol he blew up the men next to me and then me lol
2014-01-10‎"My dream ended with an old man launching a cannonball at me that only flung at practically 5 mph,killing me. ""Feeling sunburned now are ya?"""
2014-01-10‎@SincerelyTumblr @Sheboss_Jessy34 Holy shit, I just burst out laughing reading it out load in his voice XD
2014-01-10‎And some old Slender recordings I did. Gonna take me forever to get this back to normal.
2014-01-10‎"Wow, funny seeing some of the stuff from when I last backed up my computer. Still had the ""You Know What Sucks - Food Industries"" script"
2014-01-10‎Apparently I did a back-up in March so might recover some extra stuff that I might've lost.
2014-01-10‎It's back! ...now the process of transferring my shit back over.. http://t.co/pEnvfQcHM1
2014-01-09‎Oh, Madison, I am so gonna murder you now. #Coven
2014-01-09‎Stevie Nicks on @AHSFX = pure awesomeness! #Coven
2014-01-09‎Just played GTA V for 7 hours...didn't think that was possible.
2014-01-08‎Even if some stuff is lost, some of you guys always upload stuff here and there to re-download which is nice.
2014-01-08‎@twwc960 Yeah, always a good idea. Idk the last time I updated anything on it though. There's loads of stuff I'll never get back.
2014-01-08‎So here on out, saving practically EVERYTHING I do. That's just the ultimate punch to the gut. Probably lost some good stuff too.
2014-01-08‎But should have the computer back tomorrow afternoon and will work on getting everything back up and running. Just gonna take some time.
2014-01-08‎So that's just great  =(  No idea how both the hard drive and the graphics card went at the same time. That just blows my mind.
2014-01-08‎Even some music are gone. Only good news is it was only a $300 repair as opposed to $800+, the computer was saved, just not the stuff on it.
2014-01-08‎Not everything, so not sure what I do and don't have recovered. All of my videos are on the TB so they're safe. But all of my intros/outros
2014-01-08‎So I lost everything on my iMac. Both the hard drive and the video graphics card went. I've thrown stuff on a TB drive over time but
2014-01-08‎Just bit my tongue so hard that I thought it popped.
2014-01-08‎@markiplier Slender the Arrival has new content coming!
2014-01-08‎@BlueIsleStudio Awesome! Can't wait.
2014-01-08‎Finally got GTA V.
2014-01-08‎"First time playing GTA V, cops quietly follow me into my house. ""There he is"" Me: WHOA SHIT! http://t.co/Q0qFEqekls"
2014-01-08‎@imatu777 Are you coming on to me? =P
2014-01-08‎@imatu777 I don't have any drapes in my house.
2014-01-08‎@imatu777 Not much now since I went through Mowvember. They smell like old spice.
2014-01-08‎@imatu777 because any food in flight could detonate...
2014-01-08‎@imatu777 What airlines you flyin? I don't get no meals no more!
2014-01-08‎Q&amp;A anyone? Looking to kill some time here.
2014-01-08‎@reallesstroud How close were you to pulling the plug during the Kalahari episode?
2014-01-08‎It's 0 and you're wearing shorts. Yeah, you're cool..
2014-01-07‎Did anyone else's inbox disappear on YouTube?
2014-01-07‎Insert cold weather status here.
2014-01-07‎@cat_swagger Listen to some of dat music!
2014-01-07‎@EmptyIsAwesome I dont after all of the changes they made over time. I do miss the customizable freedom though. Nowadays everything's white.
2014-01-07‎"@freakshow180 Haha at the end some guy shouted out, ""Fuck you, Stephen Spielberg!"""
2014-01-07‎@freakshow180 I'm not putting it down or anything though. The original STILL gives me chills at night now and then.
2014-01-07‎@freakshow180 In the beginning, but seeing sequel after sequel come out is just exhausting its toll. I think the first one was just an indy?
2014-01-07‎@freakshow180 They're just too overdone anymore to keep me interested. I stopped watching them after the second one. It was a great concept
2014-01-07‎What are you all doing on this frigid Monday night?
2014-01-06‎I DID IIITTT!!!.....fuck... http://t.co/10ADqD8GH6
2014-01-06‎@CyberAceTV they're worth every penny. =)
2014-01-06‎Colin Kaepernick is such a fag, I'm sorry.
2014-01-06‎@TanyaChanelle haha actually made it myself on Xbox. Took hours.
2014-01-06‎@MsJorable Looks to be that way..
2014-01-06‎RT @TanyaChanelle: The fact that @PioneersProd twitter icon is Ember McClain makes me so happy, you don't even know.
2014-01-06‎Why...am I watching Glee...
2014-01-06‎@Lanier3000 lmao!
2014-01-06‎@grantkirkhope I'd be able to do a pretty solid speed run until Rusty Bucket Bay. Those propellers still make me sweat. Hardest world to me.
2014-01-06‎@AaronFuckingB I liked him in Superbad, other than that...no...I can't believe he's even an actor.
2014-01-06‎@grantkirkhope Funny, I still listen to Christmas music. Even in February I'm still blasting that shit lol
2014-01-06‎@twwc960 I can't believe people still use those things.
2014-01-06‎I only have 2 college classes this semester, besides a special projects. This is going to be a strange final semester.
2014-01-05‎"It's a ""Revolver "" day. #TheBeatles http://t.co/fd6m9Jli1h"
2014-01-05‎Very messed up dream last night....
2014-01-05‎@FNC I can't believe they made 5 already. I was in 10th grade when they made the first one o.0 21 now lol
2014-01-05‎@FNC I've already lost count lol
2014-01-05‎@FNC But it's a horror franchise so it will keep putting out sequels because they know people will watch. I can't believe they made 4 or 5?
2014-01-05‎@FNC It's just getting to the point now where they just make to many damn sequels. I stopped after the 2nd one. Should've ended it there.
2014-01-05‎Their fate lies on the foot of an NFL kicker on the last play of the game. Kicker makes it, they live, miss, they die. There's a movie idea.
2014-01-05‎Scary to think about but lately I've often wondered if there's some maniac out there who ties up a guy/girl with a gun to their head and
2014-01-05‎@EmptyIsAwesome And me too! Wow...you're like in my head tonight haha
2014-01-05‎@EmptyIsAwesome I hear ya on that one.
2014-01-05‎Thanks #Saints! I love you right now.
2014-01-05‎Where are my NFL fans?
2014-01-05‎I know the majority of you don't care about my NFL tweets but football is srs bzness!
2014-01-05‎Come on Saints, I'm not asking much but if you could beat Philly, that'd be a good thing....
2014-01-05‎@makemebad35 Alright, wasn't last second but I was close =P
2014-01-05‎@makemebad35 Chiefs will probably get a FG and Luck will drive them for a last second game winning TD.
2014-01-05‎I can't tell you how predictable the NFL is anymore. Anytime a team is down big, they come back and usually win. Watch Indy win down 31-10.
2014-01-05‎@makemebad35 See, Colts came back to make the game interesting again and will win. Give Andrew Luck more fame lol
2014-01-04‎"@makemebad35 they ""fix"" it that way =P"
2014-01-04‎@makemebad35 how do you let up 31 in a half at HOME??!
2014-01-04‎@realhartman Also, sorry for asking so many times. Really want this song.
2014-01-04‎@realhartman So much is missing in that mix that you don't hear in the episode. Will it ever surface one day as a single somewhere?
2014-01-04‎@realhartman Butch we want to know when we'll have Embers song in true quality!All thats been out there is that worn down mix from your site
2014-01-04‎My Instagram moments of 2013 (Flipagram). http://t.co/umGunFHeLf
2014-01-04‎@realhartman Speaking of music, when will Ember's song be available for download?
2014-01-04‎@freakshow180 it just hit 0 here lol
2014-01-04‎@twwc960 few inches. It's 0 here.
2014-01-04‎So who else is frozen?
2014-01-03‎@MinnesotaBurns Do you still stream on twitch anymore? Haven't seen you since before you got Ghosts.
2014-01-03‎Just a waiting game now...
2014-01-03‎Nearing the end of this computer dilemma. They ordered a video graphics board to see if that would fix it and should arrive today.
2014-01-03‎@Sheboss_Jessy34 What happened?
2014-01-03‎Is it me or me and Bruno look eerily similar in these pics...#tbt http://t.co/xQAdruhcxm
2014-01-03‎@makemebad35 I'll be dead before I finish that game.
2014-01-03‎@TacoBell stop trolling me, the roads are snow covered!
2014-01-03‎@livinginthenorm Still not 100% lol cold weather never helps my mood either so a very bad combination.
2014-01-03‎This storm can eat it. So bored! No Mac, no clear roads, no videos to edit, no fun.
2014-01-02‎@PattinsonMatt97 Sometimes they never give them enough time to right the ship. Cleveland I swear goes through a coach every other year.
2014-01-02‎Thanks Mallorie for sending fan art, as well as a very motivational kind-hearted letter =) http://t.co/4s2YnkFdiX

2014-01-02‎@Sheboss_Jessy34 Daamnnn...
2014-01-02‎Anyone wanna time warp me some Taco Bell so I don't have to drive 15 miles in the freezing cold so it stays nice and warm?
2014-01-02‎@TacoBell I'd go for some now but I'm still too hungover....
2014-01-02‎@livinginthenorm @freakshow180 and *ahem* I don't have a computer...
2014-01-02‎@livinginthenorm @freakshow180 I'm nowhere near in the mood after drinking so much last night, sorry. Been exhausted all day.
2014-01-01‎Yes, I'm crazy...
2014-01-01‎A 5 minute jog when in reality it should've taken me 15 mins.
2014-01-01‎And I barely remember even going down the hills or anything on the road. That was very irresponsible of me lol but it seemed like
2014-01-01‎Actually jogged home (about a mile to a mile a half) WITHOUT a jacket or anything, blasting my iPhone and using it's flashlight to see.
2014-01-01‎So last night my parents took my keys from me and left the party around 1. Around 1:30, I actually went out in the 18 degree cold and
2014-01-01‎@jaelentruong I'm still going after 5 1/2 years ;D
2014-01-01‎@twwc960 Really? That sucks =[
2014-01-01‎@jaelentruong mine too lol
2014-01-01‎So how was everyone's New Year's?
2014-01-01‎Alright, off to bed. Eat a dick, 2013. 2014 will be nothing but up for me. =)
2014-01-01‎@twwc960 And yeah lol doubt I'll ever do a New Year's broadcast again sadly. Especially now being 21.
2014-01-01‎@cinemassacre I hear ya on that one!
2014-01-01‎@Lanier3000 lmao the downside to the west coast.
2014-01-01‎@MinnesotaBurns Hope you have a safe and happy new year, Burnsy =)
2014-01-01‎@FNC whaaat??
2014-01-01‎@freakshow180 I hear ya on that one...
2014-01-01‎"@twwc960 Why did I tweet that? Lol I lost a beer pong game and tweeted ""fuck""...."
2014-01-01‎@makemebad35 I don't even remember tweeting that...
2014-01-01‎Hope you all have a great night, and don't get sick lol I had a moment or two but avoided it haha Seriously though , Happy New Year!
2014-01-01‎You guys won't believe what I just did and it was ludicrous.
2014-01-01‎Alright, finally sobering up.
2014-01-01‎@twwc960 sorry
2014-01-01‎Hello 2014!

2013-12-30‎@makemebad35 We've have had the offense, defense....another story. I cant tell u how many huge leads or games in general theyve blown lately
2013-12-30‎@makemebad35 More like public humiliation of can't win the big one for a decade on top of a 12 year playoff loss drought until 09.
2013-12-30‎@makemebad35 that doesn't nearly sum it up.
2013-12-30‎"""How 'bout this story with Kyle Orton now, with a chance to send his team to the playoffs"" *INTERCEPTION*. Cris Collinsworth, FUCK YOU."
2013-12-30‎Welp, three straight Week 17 losses in win or go home. Great....great.........FUUUUUUUUCCCCKKKKKKKKK! #Cowboys
2013-12-30‎..............FUCK.
2013-12-30‎Woo!!! Woo!!!
2013-12-30‎Holy balls. This game's gonna come down to the wire. Somehow make a stop, Dallas!
2013-12-29‎@makemebad35 So that's what you were referencing (UFC). Brother just showed me. Holy shit.
2013-12-29‎Can't believe it's already Week 17. Gonna miss the Sunday Ticket here on out. #NFL
2013-12-29‎Great, I'm getting back into that staying up till 3-4am routine. Still feel exhausted waking up at 1.
2013-12-28‎@FNC lmao love that thing.
2013-12-28‎@jeffdunham hope you kill here tonight! :D
2013-12-28‎@Jami3_6 As if it's a necessity lol
2013-12-28‎@89Kris one of the best movies of all-time. Although it took me until middle school to see the entire thing.
2013-12-28‎@twwc960 To figure out what the bulk of the issue is. Could be the logic board or even something more. Just gotta wait for a call back.
2013-12-28‎@twwc960 They said it would take a few days for them to look at it, or at the very least the next day. They have to run tests on it
2013-12-28‎@AaronFuckingB not bad!
2013-12-28‎Going insane without my iMac right now. 8 days now without a computer. X(
2013-12-28‎"@MinnesotaBurns ""Feels like -74"", how's that even possible??!"
2013-12-27‎So bizarre, I dreamed I became the new starting QB for the Cowboys last night and wake up to Romo on IR (injured reserve). Freaky...
2013-12-27‎Still no calls on the computer yet...
2013-12-26‎NEW skit! Although not on my channel check out this slightly belated Christmas video I did with James @Freakshow180 - http://t.co/I7gsVacnK3
2013-12-26‎Having a Final Destination marathon. Onto the third one!
2013-12-26‎So Bruno has tumors. One in his ear and one on his body  =(

2013-12-25‎What'd everyone get for Christmas?

2013-12-24‎@freakshow180 @BigAndTuff probably a drug overdose
2013-12-24‎@twwc960 I want to scrap the idea and start again from scratch. I wrote under pressure and that's not always the wise decision.
2013-12-24‎I'll go back to skits from now on.
2013-12-24‎I have zero interest and motivating to work on this anymore. It was a good concept but would rather do it all in a period of free time.
2013-12-24‎Shooting is almost impossible being it's all night shooting. Scripting as I go, running out of ideas, and winter break will be over fast.
2013-12-24‎"Thinking about pulling the plug on ""The Figure In Black"". If I'm gonna be without a computer for a period of time, I'm losing interest."
2013-12-23‎So here's the deal. It could be the graphics card, it could be the logic board. They're gonna run tests and I'll know in a day or two.
2013-12-23‎@89Kris haha yeah it was 60 here yesterday. It was awesome to have a taste of warm weather again.
2013-12-23‎"@makemebad35 I get it, because Swiss cheese has holes in it, hahahaha ""cheesy"" but funny...see what I did there?"
2013-12-22‎Like I predicted, division and playoffs comes down to next week (week 17) vs PHI.
2013-12-22‎Romo, you are ridiculous. How we won that game....

2013-12-22‎@livinginthenorm Me too man, you have no idea how devastating it is losing that iMac.
2013-12-22‎Did someone promote me or something? Been getting lots of friend requests on Xbox and my channel flew over 9,000 subscribers.
2013-12-22‎Video will be up tomorrow on the situation. I'm just...depressed right now. I know bitching and moaning won't fix this, just really...down.
2013-12-22‎RT @freakshow180: *busts through a wall and breaks everything in the room* New Freakshow180 Video on Tuesday, December 24th w/ Randis http:…
2013-12-21‎Gonna take it to an Apple store on Monday as one last ditch effort and see if anything can be done.
2013-12-21‎@twwc960 gonna try. Taking it to an official Apple store on Monday and see if anything can be done.
2013-12-21‎@89Kris well the card is $800. The serial number didn't match the apple recall list.
2013-12-21‎What perfect way to celebrate hitting over 9,000 subscribers  =(  I've been stuck under 8,900 for a year and now THIS.
2013-12-21‎2013 wanted to give me one last kick in the ass...it didn't kick...it punted....
2013-12-21‎All of my Final Cut projects GONE. All of my video intro/outro's GONE. Everything, GONE. I have stuff on a TB drive, but only so much.
2013-12-21‎$800 for one part is just ludicrous. The recall free repair was only for 27 inch iMac's, mines 21 inch. So guess I'll be losing everything.
2013-12-21‎2 1/2 years later, it breaks down. Mom's gonna take it apart and go from there, possibly buy a used one off of Ebay or something.
2013-12-21‎My computer is history. Idk what to say right now...Im in complete disbelief. That iMac was my present to myself for graduating high school.
2013-12-21‎@freakshow180 My motivation DRASTICALLY decreased these last 2 semesters. 2013 has been the worst year of my life. So glad 2014 is here.
2013-12-21‎@freakshow180 College is so unpredictable with grades. I missed about a month of one class (missing 1 of the 3 projects) and get a 'B'.
2013-12-21‎Time has gone so fast anymore that it's hard to believe they've been gone this long. Miss you, Matt and Tom.

2013-12-21‎@TylerPatSteve3 Well I've had zero issues with it until now. And I didn't get it for flash. They're superior for video editing.

2013-12-16‎I'm so sick of the NFL practically giving the Seahawks a Super Bowl guarantee. That's all it is anymore when they talk Seattle.

2013-12-16‎@EmptyIsAwesome Just saw your tweet, congrats man! Happy for you staying sober for this long! Drug battles aren't easy to get through.
2013-12-16‎@EmptyIsAwesome Really? Wow. I dont follow NCAAF at all but that's rough. Especially being NCAAF is much faster and higher scoring.
2013-12-16‎When you surrender that many pts lately on defense, you have no chance.
2013-12-16‎HOW you lose up 26-3 at the HALF is impossible.
2013-12-16‎@EmptyIsAwesome and you'd think I'd be accustomed to it by now lol
2013-12-16‎I am in complete disbelief..how..the fuck..did Dallas blow that game???!!!!! Might as well give up now, our defense is the worst in the NFL.

2013-12-11‎@CyberAceTV I really don't understand why they switched that whole network thing around. I haven't gotten any false claims...yet...
2013-12-10‎Maybe I should snort flour to make my nose stop running...
2013-12-10‎@MinnesotaBurns I heard people with their own originally composed music got false claims.Terrible way of operating that system and has been.
2013-12-10‎@MinnesotaBurns Of false claims for royalty free music, even music from iMovie. Pure garbage. This was before I was networked though.

2013-12-10‎Just some of the stuff that happens these days I swear they pay off the teams to lose.
2013-12-10‎Winner advances, loser goes home. Perfect setup. Giants winning out into the Super Bowl TWICE when there wasn't a hope in anywhere for them.
2013-12-10‎Not just because Dallas always blows games. Like this coming up, THIRD straight year for Dallas going into week 17, playoffs on the line

2013-12-09‎@Sheboss_Jessy34 I went to community college. Was roughly a little over $2k for tuition a semester. Very cheap. Getting an associate's.
2013-12-09‎@Sheboss_Jessy34 No prob! And this is it, Spring is my last semester and I'm out.
2013-12-09‎@Sheboss_Jessy34 If I could do it, you can  ;D  Just don't slack and you'll get through it. College? Yeah lol it's my 3rd year.
2013-12-09‎@Sheboss_Jessy34 College is where it's at. Less limitations, but obviously more responsibilities. But I'm ready to graduate.
2013-12-09‎@Sheboss_Jessy34 Ah jeez. Well hopefully that speeds up for you. High school is just a bump in the road in life really, besides friends.
2013-12-09‎@freakshow180 Especially like now they're like, you only have 3 1/2 weeks before you come back for Spring. Like..whaaat??! XO
2013-12-09‎@freakshow180 Finally after Spring that will never be on my mind again....hopefully. Breaks seemed shorter and shorter as I got older.
2013-12-09‎@Sheboss_Jessy34 I'd hate having to make up general classes. So glad I got all of those out of the way in my freshman year. You in HS still?
2013-12-09‎@freakshow180 Yeah that would blow. We started after Labor Day, so we have another week to go. I'll still take that over August though.
2013-12-09‎Part of me wants classes to be cancelled tomorrow but then there's that darkness in my mind that there's an extra day to make up. Effff!!!
2013-12-09‎@makemebad35 You're still searching for a decent coach though which blows. How many fucking coaches have you gone through since 2000?!
2013-12-09‎@makemebad35 ONE playoff win since 1996. It's about our turn to make a Super Bowl run again. Oakland I always forget was there in SB 37.
2013-12-09‎@makemebad35 Time in the last decade in week 17. Lost the last 2 years to WSH/NYG in week 17 which made us miss the playoffs. 1 playoff win.
2013-12-09‎@makemebad35 You know it'll come down to week 17. Always fricken does anymore in this blasted game, and Dallas practically loses 99% of the

2013-12-09‎@CyberAceTV If only I was able to do it full-time. College takes up everything. I'm hoping to try to after the Spring semester though.
2013-12-09‎"@CyberAceTV What do you mean by ""next level""?"
2013-12-09‎Wanted a part out a week but that's pressure to get it done in time. Just going work at my own pace on it.Got college finals to work on too.

2013-12-09‎@freakshow180 Honestly most papers are the same thing re-worded by everyone who submits it.
2013-12-08‎@freakshow180 Essays are such a waste of time. Instead of all these fricken guidelines why not just write what you want to say.
2013-12-08‎@makemebad35 they somehow win like 5 straight and have a shot at the division now. NFL makes a lot of fricken sense anymore.Even NY winning.

2013-11-26‎Uniforms at home since the 60s or very early 70s. That jersey is jinxed.
2013-11-26‎I can't believe it. The Cowboys are wearing the blue jerseys on Thanksgiving. I don't think they've worn their regular blue
2013-11-26‎@MinnesotaBurns Why don't you ever show face cam in your videos? (Q&amp;A)
2013-11-26‎@markiplier You...need...a...break.
2013-11-26‎Well looks like I'll have to wait until tomorrow to post it. Taking too long to export and won't be home later. It shall be worth the wait!
2013-11-26‎Was just about to upload part 1 of the video and realized I had a continuity error last minute. God DAMMIT!
2013-11-26‎@cat_swagger All I want for Christmas is my two front teeth. Screw your problems =P
2013-11-26‎Get ready for the Figure In Black part 1 video tomorrow. Some of the music is composed myself. You should enjoy this.  =)
2013-11-25‎Might delay the Figure In Black part 1 until tomorrow afternoon. I can add another scene in there then.
2013-11-25‎Video from a Canon T2i is 98 mb. And this has loads of transitions and titles. COD was just the gameplay.
2013-11-25‎Exporting makes a whole lot of sense. A 5 minute video of COD footage exported through Final Cut Pro X is 300-400 mb. Yet a 6 minute
2013-11-25‎@makemebad35 with them in the red zone in OT. That blew my mind lol never doubt Tom Brady.
2013-11-25‎@makemebad35 I turned it on and saw NE fail the 4th &amp; 5 down 24-0 and then didn't watch it from there. Next thing I know 31-31
2013-11-25‎I even said, well this ones over lol nope.
2013-11-25‎HOW did NE beat Denver? I got on Xbox when it was 24-0 and now they won 34-31 in OT. WHAT..THE..FUCK??!
2013-11-25‎I missed the entire game because of work but w00t! Cowboys!!!
2013-11-24‎Figure in Black Part 1 will be up tomorrow afternoon ;D
2013-11-24‎I'll try to get part one out by Tuesday afternoon.
2013-11-24‎To ensure EVERYTHING gets shot.
2013-11-24‎That I'd be able to upload a 30+ min video to YouTube in good quality HD. So I'll cut them up in separate parts. Also will allow time
2013-11-24‎Here's what I've decided to do. This video is going to be so long that I'll cut it into multiple parts. Also, there would be no way
2013-11-24‎@twwc960 Supposed to get down to 14 tomorrow night.
2013-11-24‎@twwc960 I know. Today was the first true day where I walked outside and felt that chill run through me that I couldn't get rid of.
2013-11-24‎@freakshow180 Once you drive in snow, you'll hate it too lol I don't mind it if I'm on winter break or off from work. But driving, noo.
2013-11-24‎Who turned on the cold outside?? It's that awful damp freezing cold type of cold. I hate the cold. Really..ff-Fr-Fricken hh-hate it.
2013-11-23‎Another bullshit Google+ problem. You can't even SHARE the damn video without being marked as spam! http://t.co/QSI7oK5WJF
2013-11-23‎@Ninja_Somewhere Giants have a habit of streaking into the postseason. Six games left and they still have a shot at the damn division.
2013-11-23‎@Ninja_Somewhere They started 0-6 on the season out of 16 games, now they're 4-6. They play my Cowboys tomorrow who ate 5-6.
2013-11-23‎"Remember what I said, ""If the Giants make the playoffs, the NFL is rigged""."
2013-11-23‎The Giants are guaranteeing a victory tomorrow. I hope you guys get smoked and watch the playoffs on the couch.
2013-11-23‎@MinnesotaBurns I'd rather die than watch one on Siege.
2013-11-23‎@MinnesotaBurns Maybe because of how enormous the damn maps are.
2013-11-22‎@makemebad35 doesn't look as bad as last year...yet =P
2013-11-22‎@freakshow180 Never have.

2013-11-21‎@FNC High/Best quality and it still is always huge. Alright, thanks.
2013-11-21‎@FNC Ah alright, yeah because it seems like it always varies. I made a custom export setting to compress it down to medium instead of

2013-11-21‎@FNC Compressor? Most of them are always 700+ MB &amp; using MPEG Streamclip always drains and flares the colors. Also my upload speed is awful.

2013-11-20‎@smpfilms well you shouldn't have to worry about it. You probably still make enough to live off of. Would kill for that.

2013-11-16‎No videos are going to be removed. The channel itself will remain up but will not be active anymore, meaning I won't be checking it.
2013-11-16‎Shutting down the PioneersProductions2 channel. All vlogs, bloopers, extras, etc will all be posted on the main channel from now on.

2013-11-14‎Coming to a YouTube screen near you...soon... http://t.co/KVH6kX4weB
2013-11-14‎I didn't blitz through this one. It's not Halloween themed so it wont make a difference if it's out a month passed Oct 31.
2013-11-14‎Halloween videos are a passion of mine and always want to take time and put care into them. I think it shows over the years. Which is why
2013-11-14‎and out in a couple weeks. Nothing worse than going into production and scrapping the script all together and starting over.
2013-11-14‎This has been by far the most difficult video to write. Idk why but I've almost lost sleep over this one. Looking to have it all shot
2013-11-14‎FINALLY! I am getting creative gears working again on the belated Halloween video. Looking to get a teaser trailer out this weekend.
2013-11-14‎@FNC that's very helpful. Thanks! There's always so much more to learn with Final Cut.
2013-11-14‎@makemebad35 hope that helps anyways. If not, try what @FNC said. Could be even better ;D
2013-11-14‎@makemebad35 that's just talking from an indie game perspective though. Console stuff, yeah id try another way.
2013-11-14‎@FNC are you serious? I just got X a month ago. Nifty!
2013-11-14‎@makemebad35 web cam size, color adjust, etc as needed. Really is a nifty program besides just recording the screen.
2013-11-14‎@makemebad35 you can always insert clips from different Screenflow projects into the timeline. You can add video and music files and crop
2013-11-14‎@makemebad35 well you both use seperate computers right? So just save the Screenflow files as raw documents and then transfer in the footage
2013-11-14‎@makemebad35 the mic audio (which is a blue yeti) and match that up in Screenflow.
2013-11-14‎@makemebad35 I record the game through Screenflow and the webcam lol records it all as separate video files. Just use audacity to record
2013-11-14‎Noo! How could you break Stevie?! #Coven
2013-11-14‎Doesn't feel like a Wednesday. Ready for more @AHSFX!

2013-11-11‎Just a guy who's fed up with the same shit different year jazz.Still a very clear shot to win the division, but that window is closing fast.
2013-11-11‎Surprised if the fricken Giants make a run now. That's what Dallas is anymore. Hot and cold, yes and no. I'm no fair whether fan
2013-11-11‎Tied with the Eagles for first place...FUCK. Now's when the wheels come off and the #Cowboys finish (8-8) again. Hell wouldn't even be
2013-11-11‎@freakshow180 you know that Lavender Town creepy pasta where the music made kids kill themselves? This....is worse than that.
2013-11-11‎I expected a closer game than this. Of course the Dallas D blows it again. Unless the planets aline, this one's over.
2013-11-11‎@freakshow180 I think I'm going to go commit suicide after watching this......
2013-11-11‎@freakshow180 I will lol I'm watching the Cowboys game. My team needs me =P

2013-11-08‎@freakshow180 how 'bout those who impersonate cartoon characters on Instagram, Facebook, and Twitter.
2013-11-08‎@MinnesotaBurns If the Vikings make the playoffs, there is no hope for the NFL.
2013-11-08‎@TheArchfiend I just pray they don't sneak into the playoffs like last year. Losing tonight though definitely hurt those chances.
2013-11-08‎How the hell did the Vikings win? I would've bet my money that RG3 would've clutched a TD in the end there.
2013-11-08‎@twwc960 I really have no idea. I was able to respond to a different person. But for the one if I hit reply it told me I wasn't aloud to.
2013-11-08‎@twwc960 Supposedly you can't respond to people if they comment through the Google+ page on the video. Somehow that links it to YouTube?

2013-11-07‎@MinnesotaBurns And have it all link to your Google account, but it's waaayyy too confusing to navigate your account anymore with that.
2013-11-07‎@MinnesotaBurns Why they decided to link it to YouTube is beyond me. There's no purpose to it. They want to be similar to Facebook I guess.
2013-11-07‎@MinnesotaBurns It is by far the most useless feature on YouTube. I literally know maybe one person that actually uses G+ in general.
2013-11-06‎@Ninja_Somewhere And the call signs don't show up when you kill people. Half the time I can never tell if I shot someone or not.
2013-11-06‎@Ninja_Somewhere It's just subtle things that annoy me, like the kill-feed is on the top right portion of the screen (scoreboard too).
2013-11-06‎@Ninja_Somewhere I'm four barring or not. Why they would remove that blows my mind.
2013-11-06‎@Ninja_Somewhere One of the biggest issues I have with the game is there's no connection bars next to the scoreboard. I can never tell if
2013-11-06‎So what's everyone's take on COD Ghosts? I just gotta give it time. Hard to adapt from transitioning from Black Ops II.

2013-11-06‎@331EROCK you are awesome for allowing free use of your music. Keep it up! :D

2013-11-06‎@Warrior_Geek it's very different. Just subtle things.
2013-11-06‎Well so far all I'll say is I'm a little disappointed with this one.

2013-11-02‎@freakshow180 I mean for YouTube.
2013-11-02‎EXCEPT for the channel URL, that will forever be stuck as PioneersHorror. I do more COD than indie horror, so the change makes sense.
2013-11-02‎"The gaming channel will from here on out be called ""PioneersGaming"" not ""PioneersHorror"". It'll show up that way on YouTube here on out"
2013-11-02‎The only thing they can do now to make this worse is what Instagram did and have circle profile pics on YouTube instead of the square.

2013-11-02‎So I'm in a G+ hangout and @imatu777 literally played the Halloween theme exactly the moment I did. That...was fucked up!

2013-11-01‎@freakshow180 RIP Low Budget Video...
2013-11-01‎Slow paced and obviously, suspenseful. It will be worth it though, trust me. Still a long ways to go though. Not giving ANY details away.
2013-11-01‎This video is really different and is going to be lengthy. Maybe even longer than the Furby video was last year. I want it to be film-like.
2013-11-01‎That I couldn't get it out on time, but that's how production goes. Sometimes the story needs to be completely re-written and re-shot.
2013-11-01‎"I won't have a new main channel video out until this ""Halloween"" video is finished. It's taking all I have to make this one. Really sucks"
2013-11-01‎Wow, that's a lousy way to lose a game, Cincinnati...

2013-10-31‎@makemebad35 they take a lot of work though. Like the Furby video for me last year was 16 mins and took 4 nights to shoot everything.
2013-10-31‎@makemebad35 I'd kill to see you actually make a scary short film around 15-20 mins long. I think you'd be able to create something awesome.

2013-10-24‎@PointProd Especially the shots were it's an image rather than a Live video shot. Like the box on the table with the Alligator sticking out.

2013-10-24‎@PointProd It's funny how I never really looked at the Alligator, Horse Head, Frog/Whale videos in that way.
2013-10-24‎@freakshow180 I had to rush it because I started college a WEEK after we shot it.

2013-10-12‎I've had so many issues audio-wise and transitions-wise that it's just not compatible for my videos anymore. I want to get more advanced
2013-10-12‎DSLRs and is practically 3/4 the price. I've wanted to upgrade to a better program for a year now because iMovie is just crap mostly.
2013-10-12‎Decided to take the Final Cut Pro X plunge and buy it. I've worked with Final Cut Pro 7 in college but X has new updates that benefit
2013-10-12‎@JigsawdeadPage I'm going with Damian being drunk on this one lol
2013-10-12‎@makemebad35 I'm gonna kill you and bury you twice....
2013-10-12‎@freakshow180 Lightning would 'strike' and resurrect him (like in Horse Head Lives)
2013-10-12‎@freakshow180 And no, you were supposed to make fun of my dead body (the Burglar's) and dump me over the edge into the swamp.
2013-10-12‎@freakshow180 ....you know....now that I think of it....the Burglar reminded me of how the guy from the IDO looked. Mr. Moustachio?
2013-10-12‎@imatu777 @freakshow180 Like Horse Head Lives, Home Invasion, the Furby video. I even did a Burglar video in the style of Halloween.
2013-10-12‎@imatu777 @freakshow180 Glad I didnt do it because I wouldve never gotten that stench out of my clothes. Those videos spawned my dark stuff.
2013-10-12‎@imatu777 @freakshow180 True fact, the Burglar movie was supposed to start with his dead body getting dumped into a swamp in my backyard.
2013-10-12‎@imatu777 @freakshow180 You know...the Burglar really wasn't anything special lol But honestly, he'd scare me in a dark alley.
2013-10-12‎@imatu777 Never heard of it..then again, I am music retarded.
2013-10-12‎@makemebad35 ...I couldn't think of anything intimidating so you'll have to just live with that...
2013-10-12‎@makemebad35 You never cease to amaze me man lol Which is why I'll dream of beating you over the head with a chunk of wood tonight lol
2013-10-12‎@makemebad35 I thought my little video would've prevented a monstrosity like that..but NO, you thought it was funny and do something worse.
2013-10-12‎You all motivate me to do my best and never give up. You're all awesome. Thank you.  =)
2013-10-12‎You guys are a huge reason I get up in the morning.You guys are the reason my creativity never stops (maybe just briefly in writer's blocks)
2013-10-12‎And that is truly what motivates me to keep pressing on, on not only YouTube, but in real life as well.
2013-10-12‎I can always count on you guys no matter what circumstance or dark entity stands in my way. Through thick and thin, you're all here.
2013-10-12‎You are all amazing and devoted viewers, I must say. Even if the video only had 20 comments, that doesn't matter.
2013-10-12‎@makemebad35 YOU...ARE DEAD...I'm gonna go conspire with David now. =P

2013-10-11‎Some of you Facebooked messaged me  which I've read and responded to.
2013-10-11‎I uh..haven't read the comments yet on the video. But I will. I had to go to work so rushed the video up before I left.
2013-10-11‎@freakshow180 You? Holy shit. Figures, I got the iPhone 5 a month after it came out and then 6 months later they stop producing them lol
2013-10-11‎"New video, ""I'm Sorry...You Mean the World to Me..."" - http://t.co/jMgPjGhmeH  This has to be said."
2013-10-11‎First nightmare I've had for the longest time. Next thing I knew there were four bears in front of the car lol was like a horror movie.
2013-10-11‎Bolted to the car and actually pushed off the old man to get a head start. Miraculously he made it to the car and we got in, in time.
2013-10-11‎Here Im getting gas in my dream at midnight.Get out of the car talk to the owner &amp; a bigass bear starts charging the guy 10 ft away. I shit.
2013-10-11‎@cat_swagger Sorry about that, I mention that in my video tomorrow...somewhere in the 18 mins lol I shall re-add and never remove again  =)
2013-10-11‎@cat_swagger PioneersProd, didn't know you had Xbox.
2013-10-11‎@BigAndTuff @freakshow180 @imatu777 You guys are too much. I love you all, no homo.
2013-10-11‎Also, apologies in advance if it makes anyone tear up or cry...
2013-10-11‎This video is 18 mins long, can you guys handle that? Gonna be murder on my internet uploading tomorrow, but I shall deliver it  =)
2013-10-11‎@freakshow180 I don't know why but I'm laughing my ass off at these tweets. You're not moving anywhere, I promise.
2013-10-11‎@freakshow180 Now...why on Earth would that happen?
2013-10-11‎@twwc960 Trust me, I'm not shutting down or anything. Even though it's a lengthy speech, it has some things true from my heart being said.
2013-10-11‎@freakshow180 No, thankfully. I would've told you before anyone else immediately if I was moving away.
2013-10-11‎@twwc960 no, never lol it's just me really.
2013-10-11‎@meelzdiva17 it's just a bunch of mixed emotions mixed into one video. It's not a bad video by any means. Just some things I need to say.
2013-10-11‎NEVER had something like that happen before.
2013-10-11‎I uh..made a pretty emotional abs sincere video and..went to get food afterwords and the clerk even noticed I looked unhappy.
2013-10-11‎@makemebad35 well I picked Brady as the starter and even he's not having the greatest season so far. Figured Brady/Manning, good cover.
2013-10-11‎@makemebad35 Good. I need to cut him from fantasy. Have him as a backup.
2013-10-11‎It's something that needs to be said. A very serious video about my viewers.
2013-10-11‎Very important video going up tomorrow...
2013-10-10‎Hey, wanna lift? #tbt http://t.co/QEHpXRagV7
2013-10-10‎@JigsawdeadPage You're awesome! I looked there but missed that one somehow. Thanks man!
2013-10-10‎@makemebad35 One of my instructors mentioned it. Probably something I'd watch.
2013-10-10‎So tired of everything shifting just because I slightly angle my phone. It tries to adjust to the way you're holding it. Driving me mad.
2013-10-10‎For iOS7, is there any way to turn off anything so your wallpaper and app icons don't move the way you angle your phone?
2013-10-10‎@FNC wtf, did you inhale it? Lmao
2013-10-10‎@freakshow180 that's how every season is. I love that too. Jessica Lange especially. She's fricken oscar worthy in season 2.
2013-10-10‎@Lanier3000 I finally started watching the first two seasons. Always just caught random episodes on A&amp;E. Love that show.
2013-10-10‎@freakshow180 more complex but I think it's right up there with season one. Always had me on the edge.
2013-10-10‎@freakshow180 never knew you watched it. Season 1 was awesome because you never knew who was dead. Season two seemed much darker themed.
2013-10-10‎I think I might actually like AHS season two over the first. It's close but it was awesome.
2013-10-10‎I'm ready for another great season of #AmericanHorrorStory :D

2013-10-09‎Happy birthday in heaven, John Lennon. #TheBeatles
2013-10-09‎@mattmemelo I hate it anymore. I hate the work, I hate the instructors, I hate the 30 minute drive there. I can't stand it anymore.
2013-10-09‎@Booondock I know, can't wait. Last season was surprisingly good.
2013-10-09‎Just played a pretty popular YouTuber on Black Ops II.Not sure if anyone knows who the Worm is. Funny shit happened with him trashing a kid.
2013-10-08‎I'm that guy from that thing! You know, the one where...well now I don't even know... http://t.co/qEv93r3noq
2013-10-08‎So glad @AHSFX is back tomorrow! Anyone watching?
2013-10-08‎@freakshow180 lol really? I bet it's still nowhere near as nice  =P
2013-10-08‎The weather is always perfect, dark, moist, and windy. It just fits for my videos, no idea why. Also sucks having a deadline though.
2013-10-08‎Horse Head Lives only took two. Furby took about 4, not counting the days of equipment setup for the woods scenes. Nonetheless, love it.
2013-10-08‎Only downside is having to shoot late evenings and requires MULTIPLE and I mean MULTIPLE nights.
2013-10-08‎Halloween videos might actually be my favorite types of videos to film and write. Anything pretty much goes rule-wise.
2013-10-07‎The Furby video last year was my trial with it pretty much, and that ran for about 16 minutes. We'll see.
2013-10-07‎This might be a multiple part Halloween Special. I have to see what happens with this. Kind of scripting this slow paced, like a movie.
2013-10-07‎Also some editing tricks I've never used before. Going to be interesting.
2013-10-07‎Writing this year's Halloween video. Wish me luck. Lots of interesting stuff going into this one.
2013-10-07‎@freakshow180 and of course I parked three hundred feet from the building today.
2013-10-07‎@EmptyIsAwesome I believe it.
2013-10-07‎Things today we wondered how we lived without them, well we did. Screw today's cutting edge and digital shit.
2013-10-07‎Sometimes I wish technology could just stop moving forward. The media just crash. Cell phones decrease. Things were fine decades ago.
2013-10-06‎FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUCCCCCCKKKKKKKKKKK DENVER!!!!!!!

2013-09-29‎And look who won the Super Bowl...the Giants.
2013-09-29‎I'll never forget it, two years ago when the Giants beat Dallas to save their season (needing to win out) and did, I said the NFL was fixed.
2013-09-29‎Setting this in stone; if the Giants, Steelers, Redskins, or Eagles win the Super Bowl this year, then the NFL is fixed/planned.
2013-09-29‎If the Vikings win today, I'll be dancing in the streets. Screw Pittsburgh.
2013-09-29‎@makemebad35 So it's a haunted bar? That would be awesome.

2013-09-28‎I kind of did this in the beginning months ago, but it was hard to read the text. So this will make the videos hopefully funnier.

2013-09-27‎@Brad13139 No idea why they're so strict on music these days anymore. Practically impossible to truly know if they're copyrighted or not.
2013-09-27‎@Brad13139 But it gets so tiring having to file disputes when you shouldn't have to. Only good thing is the emails said it's not penalizing.
2013-09-27‎@Brad13139 I had a few Royalty Free Music clips get picked up over the years. One I could understand since it was an orchestrated classic.
2013-09-27‎What really sucks though is since Nathan Wills passed away, his family took down his website about half a year ago. So that's little proof.
2013-09-27‎This is already the second video in two months that got falsely copyrighted claimed for music. This better get overturned or Ima rage!
2013-09-27‎Never had this happen but did for this video. Da fuck YouTube? You're so strict on copyright violations anymore.
2013-09-27‎For the first time ever I got a falsely copyrighted claim over a Nathan Wills song, but it was picked up as something completely different.

2013-09-26‎@FNC For some bizarre reason I dreamed you guys we streaming in a giant parking lot and you were so excited about something
2013-09-26‎@freakshow180 They changed that too. It's like what Twitch is where you stream TO the server.
2013-09-26‎@freakshow180 I don't really have the will to try and grow an audience there because I feel the same thing will happen.
2013-09-26‎@freakshow180 hahaha I've really not done any shows since. Ustream is okay..but no one will show up there.

2013-09-24‎High School would take 3-4 HOURS. Education is pure bullshit at times.
2013-09-24‎That's mainly for research papers but still you get tortured with limitations and shit. I can write a college paper in probably 20/30 mins.
2013-09-24‎In college, papers are a cakewalk. When you compare it to a high school essay, they swamp you with all of these MLA/APA shit and formats.

2013-09-24‎I was just laughing verbally reading my script, turned around and saw my closet light was on. I had it off.
2013-09-24‎OKAY..this is by far the freakiest thing..here in my script I'm writing about the fear of closets and what light turns on..the closet light.
2013-09-24‎This script might be one of the dirtiest ones I've ever written..and I'm only halfway done...
2013-09-24‎Gonna focus way less on the gaming channel for a bit and get focused on this skit and a 'possible' Halloween video.
2013-09-24‎Writing a new skit as I speak. Been forever but finally getting one written! Something completely original too  ;D
2013-09-24‎@EmptyIsAwesome Yeah can't wait for that to start back up. Hoping it lives up to the previous two.
2013-09-24‎@TheTadambag101 Has the old 80s horror feel to them sometimes, which is what I love.
2013-09-24‎@TheTadambag101 Didn't beat the first but it was pretty good. Gave me quite a few scares. Love the style of the Insidious films.

2013-09-23‎@MinnesotaBurns That doesn't top what happened to Malarchuk with the skate to the neck. Ever see that? I wanted to throw up.
2013-09-23‎Johnson not Mendenhall , my bad.
2013-09-23‎That's just nuts. Making a tackle and taking your glove off to have your fingertip still in the glove. That's ridiculous.
2013-09-23‎Here I am watching NFL Top 10 when Lott of the 49ers had his finger amputated the other day &amp; now Mendenhall loses his finger tip yesterday.
2013-09-23‎@makemebad35 Dat profile pic, one word; swag.
2013-09-23‎Criminal Minds before bed.
2013-09-22‎@TheArchfiend Surprised you haven't mentioned the Giants lol
2013-09-22‎If the Bears beat the Steelers tonight then practically every team I hate will have lost.
2013-09-22‎Oh RG3, oh RG3, how does it feel to be (0-3)?
2013-09-22‎Cowboys just doin work on STL.
2013-09-22‎Who let you in my bedroom??! http://t.co/mo0bpfTjk2
2013-09-21‎Running Troll 2 | Running Horse, new vid - http://t.co/7JMpBeUaAM
2013-09-21‎Is YouTube just not processing videos today or what? Grr..
2013-09-20‎I actually don't hate iOS 7 as much as I thought I would when I first saw it.
2013-09-20‎@MinnesotaBurns That might've been the hardest I laughed at your stream ever, when you smashed the headset. At first I was :O... XD XD XD
2013-09-20‎In my dream last night I was trying to puke for some reason. On the sleep talk app it sounded like I actually puked in my mouth, da fuck?!
2013-09-20‎@MinnesotaBurns dude you NEED to upload the part where you smashed your headset XD
2013-09-20‎Who would've thought the Chiefs would starts (3-0). Close games but a win is a win.
2013-09-20‎Thank you Hiroshi Yamauchi for helping make our childhoods awesome. RIP, man. #Nintendo
2013-09-19‎@realhartman Any updates on Ember's song yet?
2013-09-19‎@MinnesotaBurns The Jets are an NHL team? Who the hell did they used to be?
2013-09-19‎@FNC haha really? I'm usually that way too. I hate the update and then just get used to it. Like YouTubes dreaded changes.
2013-09-19‎iOS 7 is more of an android look to me. I don't like change!
2013-09-19‎@twwc960 I didn't buy from Amazon's official sale, from a company through amazon. So it could've been anyone.
2013-09-18‎@cinemassacre I always thought you two looked similar. You've probably heard it a lot lol
2013-09-18‎@Ninja_Somewhere That period was when I panicked in my mind, worrying about blanking and stuff. Once I was up there, I was fine.
2013-09-18‎@Ninja_Somewhere I never really completely blanked or anything. It was just the tension of knowing how many were going before my turn.
2013-09-18‎"New vlog, ""21!"" - http://t.co/PbS3hpV8IS"
2013-09-18‎@freakshow180 Just having to memorize the stuff is what killed me inside. I could stand but I always feared going blank or transitioning.
2013-09-18‎@freakshow180 Like, I've talked to hundreds of people I don't know on the internet for hours for years.But still was always nervous in class
2013-09-18‎@freakshow180 In a cheesy way, I feel doing those BlogTv shows for years helped me a little. I always pictured it in my head that way
2013-09-18‎@EmptyIsAwesome @freakshow180 We love you too Empty  =P
2013-09-18‎I got suckered  =P
2013-09-18‎Go figure, a set that costs $194, getting it for $88 should've been a red flag,but this was years ago before I knew how to order off Amazon.
2013-09-18‎It would just say (Track 01, Track 02, Track 03), in iTunes. The box had some slightly visible glue marks for the box cover.
2013-09-18‎And the nail in the coffin was on any computer you put the CDs into, there was literally no info on what songs or albums were which.
2013-09-18‎It's always been in the back of mind of how it could've been fake. Analyzed the fuck out of it for the longest time
2013-09-18‎Soo, I bought a Beatles Mono Box Set off of Amazon about two years ago, and I think I've come to realize it was a counterfeit set.
2013-09-18‎That car wreck was by far the worst day of my life. Losing my first ever car and then having my brother lose his ten days after.
2013-09-18‎Talked to one of the guys I crashed into today from back in February. Surprised he remembered me. Hard to believe that was 7 months ago.
2013-09-18‎@TheStupidWizard haha thanks.
2013-09-18‎@EmptyIsAwesome Im just flat out not a morning person.
2013-09-18‎@TheStupidWizard how do you pull that one off? I've done it once for college. Grade school that bags glued to you.
2013-09-18‎@freakshow180 Speech class? About damn time you had to take that.
2013-09-18‎Tried uploading a Vlog before I went out yesterday but for some reason it froze in the processing stage. Thanks YouTube.
2013-09-18‎Thanks again for all of the birthday wishes. Still feels unreal to me. My brother's already mooching off of me for beer lol
2013-09-18‎@twwc960 that's not a drunk tweet =P
2013-09-18‎@89Kris thanks man.
2013-09-18‎My birthday wish is for Ember's song to be released in HD by @realhartman Don't care what you say; that song rules.
2013-09-18‎@freakshow180 never was truly drunk until New Years of last year (2012).
2013-09-18‎@freakshow180 I had a Tom Collins mix but non-alcoholic. But for some bizarre reason I lost my mind. Wasn't drunk at all.
2013-09-18‎One thing that differs me from other people who drink, I don't drunk tweet. Stupid really. Like people need to know shit like that.
2013-09-18‎@AdamMWeideman lmfao
2013-09-18‎@AdamMWeideman and then one day I drank an entire bottle from my grandfathers basement (around 7 years old). Got grounded for a week lol
2013-09-18‎@AdamMWeideman trust me, you'll transition. I loved beer since I was 6. Dad and grandfather always gave me sips.
2013-09-18‎@AdamMWeideman I'm good so far lol I know the feeling all too well. Spacing stuff out.
2013-09-18‎Doing shots for the first legal time. http://t.co/Nw39wMw3gc
2013-09-17‎@twwc960 I'm not complaining lol I know, appreciate the young look while you have it.
2013-09-17‎First legal beer and I get carded. Guarantee you I will for the next 10 years.
2013-09-17‎@Nighty74 thanks a million, man!
2013-09-17‎RT @BigAndTuff: im goning to by my beer from @pioneersprod and sell it to the other 15 yeer olds
2013-09-17‎@TheArchfiend Im not one but you don't mess with the brony community lol
2013-09-17‎@ChristopherW69 thanks Chris!
2013-09-17‎"Can't believe I'm 21 today. As @MinnesotaBurns would say, ""Woo! Woo! Woo!"""
2013-09-17‎@zoebeautyhaul thanks Zoe!
2013-09-17‎@americnakatsuki thanks!
2013-09-17‎@TheTadambag101 haha thanks man!
2013-09-17‎@ryoumymummy I hear ya, thanks!
2013-09-17‎@twwc960 Thanks man!
2013-09-17‎@TylerPatSteve3 Thanks, 21 creeped up on me!
2013-09-17‎@TylerPatSteve3 I hear ya on that one.
2013-09-17‎Parents couldn't wait for tomorrow night. Can't believe I'm 21 in an hour! http://t.co/j7HoH0y95x
2013-09-16‎@DavidSpade as long as you don't hear any screams, you're okay lol
2013-09-16‎@mattmemelo I remember I used to be obsessed with that brand, until I went to American Eagle.
2013-09-16‎@JulianWasHere I feel bad for Mr. Timn, he doesn't know how to cross the street. (???? - 2011).
2013-09-16‎@kierrrrrrr yeah people treat their phones/iPods better than their lovers haha
2013-09-16‎Just found out about the shooting in Washington. People in this world are just plain fucked up. Guns don't kill people, people do.
2013-09-16‎@kierrrrrrr that's weird lol
2013-09-16‎@AaronFuckingB it will never beat Robert's naked perfection though ;D
2013-09-16‎Time since graduating high school really has escaped me. Now it's like, this is the real world and this is who I'm gonna be for life.
2013-09-16‎I can't believe I'm turning 21 tomorrow. I remember 10 years ago thinking I'd never live to 21, like it would never come.Here it's tomorrow.
2013-09-16‎@HotPepperGaming @markiplier And he's as excited as ever  =P
2013-09-16‎@MinnesotaBurns Is that show really as good as everyone makes it out to be? People treat it like it's god or something.
2013-09-15‎Going back to why people favorite certain tweets...umm, why the fuck would anyone RT/Fav this?? http://t.co/bPpA5xH9Xg
2013-09-15‎Nothing pleases me more then seeing RG3 struggle.
2013-09-15‎Dez Bryant looked like Michael Irvin with that TD.
2013-09-15‎39 degrees out. I'm freezing under my covers. #FallBlows
2013-09-14‎Idk how people love fall. It's just a dismal, cold, gray overcast time for me. No color (well leaves change but they fall).
2013-09-14‎@CyberAceTV So trying to get the scoop on why that is. Grr..
2013-09-14‎@CyberAceTV Well, this was long before they changed. I applied the channel, got it approved but it says status inactive. Just realized it.
2013-09-14‎@CyberAceTV I swear I got an email on that saying it was a glitch.
2013-09-14‎Machinima blows not linking the gaming channel to my main. Tried for over a month and still nothing. Still have the YouTube $ symbol.
2013-09-14‎For YouTube networks, can you only be in one per AdSense account? Might explain why I'm getting rejected by one for my gaming channel.
2013-09-14‎@89Kris that blows. Lots seem to only have the PS3.
2013-09-14‎@MinnesotaBurns Ah, looks like I missed ya. Damn, wanted to try and get in a sub lobby but had work.
2013-09-13‎@AaronFuckingB or the cereal one, or the naked rocks, or....damn your vids are good....
2013-09-13‎@AaronFuckingB one of my favorites. Idk why though, I think my all-time fav is the vampire hunter one. That or gibby's dreams.
2013-09-13‎@Lanier3000 I know, wish there was a way to merge the two together.
2013-09-13‎Would be fun to play with subscribers for a change. I'll have a video out on it in a few days.
2013-09-13‎Could do it for a few hours or however long it takes lol just message my gamertag so I can send invites or know who's able.
2013-09-13‎Most likely Wednesday since I'll be out Tuesday night. If you're interested in playing, send me a message on Xbox Live to PioneersProd
2013-09-13‎Those interested, I might do an open Black Ops II lobby Tuesday or Wednesday evening for my 21st birthday.

2013-09-13‎"@smpfilms You could play that..or Nathan Wills' ""Dreaming"" album  =)"

2013-09-12‎@MinnesotaBurns Are you going to do any subscriber lobbies later or just the tK shout cast?
2013-09-12‎@OnlyDave_ games could be daily. Reviews, not sure.
2013-09-12‎@OnlyDave_ I always thought once a week was fine. Just depends on your genre of video. Like for me, skits are an excuse for not daily.
2013-09-12‎@thebeatles nice. Def need to buy this!
2013-09-12‎@OnlyDave_ haven't posted a vid in a month. I'm due lol hate slacking.
2013-09-12‎@freakshow180 It shocks me that he got as big as he did. Forgot he had music videos. But he was fricken young back then.
2013-09-12‎@freakshow180 Oh come on, don't tell me you don't remember that kid. And actually...he posted his first video in over a year the other week.
2013-09-12‎@freakshow180 SuperMac18?
2013-09-12‎Too much fricken stuff to manage. Plus college on top of that and part-time job. Not gonna happen lol Oh well. Back to the drawing board.
2013-09-12‎So much stuff that it's just not even worth it. There's the original mic audio file, the exported mic audio, the game recording itself, etc.
2013-09-12‎An endless amount of clips just litter my desktop and game capture library. Now put that on top of my regular BO2 stuff that's captured.
2013-09-12‎Now had I done it in summer, I could've made it work. Ah well, was a good idea though.
2013-09-12‎Pulling the plug on the Frog/Whale Xbox Live video. Thought it could work and be funny but it's just way too much work and patience to do.
2013-09-11‎@freakshow180 I can't believe you're still tweeting from that page haha
2013-09-11‎@Katidoodlesmuch @FNC haha that's by far my favorite prank call. Especially how it was trending...TWICE.
2013-09-11‎Got up to leave class and for some bizarre reason I turned around, wallet was on the chair. Never have I had that happen lol
2013-09-11‎I was about to only turn 9 years old when 9/11 happened. Does not feel like 12 years. #NeverForget

2013-09-10‎@MinnesotaBurns Sweet, I don't work Wednesday. Should be fun  :D
2013-09-10‎@twwc960 lol you mean vlogs? They're on the 2nd channel =P
2013-09-09‎@Ninja_Somewhere Well it's different when you can record &amp; make videos from it and touch them up in editing. But yeah I know what you mean.
2013-09-09‎"""Vanish"" Reaction Compilation - http://t.co/FancBFVV0B"
2013-09-09‎@freakshow180 I like the profile pic more than the channel art hahaha
2013-09-09‎@Ninja_Somewhere I think it's amazing how you can just record gameplay with the press of a button on your computer and upload it.
2013-09-09‎@Ninja_Somewhere Well it's something I like doing. I wouldn't put out multiple videos a week from a game I hate lol
2013-09-09‎Just a way I can still do YouTube videos without doing skits. So think of it as me loving you twice as much  ;D
2013-09-09‎Trust me, I know most of you are probably sick of being force fed with Black Ops II lol I'm not pursuing that as my new channel or anything.
2013-09-09‎For those who obviously prefer my skits over my gaming videos, it's only a temporary solution for not getting the house to myself.
2013-09-09‎@Ninja_Somewhere It needs some spicing up. People are visiting but not posting.
2013-09-09‎How's everybody's Monday going?
2013-09-09‎@cinemassacre But if you were an Eagles or Steelers fan I'd smack ya lol
2013-09-09‎@cinemassacre ohh come on James, how could you not be a football fan =P
2013-09-09‎@freakshow180 the planets must have aligned o.o
2013-09-09‎@Ninja_Somewhere thanks for being literal =P
2013-09-09‎@CyberAceTV literally almost fell on my face or backwards out of the chair lol plus was my second time taking the fricken class.
2013-09-09‎@CyberAceTV never done it. Came extremely close multiple times a year and a half ago in an 8am history college class. Never again.
2013-09-09‎@dallascowboys you know it.
2013-09-09‎How did I sleep with my contact lenses in, two nights in a row?
2013-09-09‎6 turnovers over the G-Men feels sooo good.
2013-09-09‎Oooooooooohhhhhhhhh!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! #Cowboys
2013-09-09‎Giants, I swear..if you drive the field for a TD, I'm shoving my foot up your ass and I'm keeping it up there for 5 months.
2013-09-09‎@Booondock I'd rather Joe Theisman commentate than him. Just annoying.
2013-09-09‎5 turnovers on the Giants. I'm lovin it!
2013-09-09‎...orrr maybe not.
2013-09-09‎"Fair warning, expect a ""I fucking hate the Giants; good night"" tweet within the next hour and a half."
2013-09-09‎Worst nightmare is your starting QB, who you just extended to a 6 year contract, go down in the 2nd Qtr of opening night.
2013-09-09‎So glad Romo just had the wind knocked out of him and wasn't a serious injury. I shit when I saw him go down.
2013-09-09‎@freakshow180 lmao
2013-09-08‎@makemebad35 Thought Pryor was gonna throw a TD in the end there  =\
2013-09-08‎@TheArchfiend what I love to see. Screw PIT.
2013-09-08‎And the worst new uniform in the league goes to the Jaguars. #NFL
2013-09-08‎Three safeties already between three games. Da fuck??
2013-09-08‎@MinnesotaBurns I was lucky to grab him first in my fantasy league.
2013-09-08‎Back to football feels so amazing.
2013-09-08‎Check out the intro for BO2 videos from now on ;D - http://t.co/36HwqURt0R
2013-09-08‎I am not making this up haha Just happened by pure coincidence. You'll have to hear it to see what I mean. Hard to explain over Twitter.
2013-09-08‎"To ""Ohh fuck! What the fuck?!?"" from a random person I played, to ""Ohh goddd mah fucking tits!"" from the same guy. And then ""OMG David!"""
2013-09-08‎"David (SuperKaiju) goes ""I'm gonna touch you with my ding-ding"", which goes to me ""God, god noo! You fucking son of a bitch!"""
2013-09-08‎Where their gamertag, emblem, and a quote they said would come up.The order in how the quotes progressed almost made me fall out of my chair
2013-09-08‎So what happened was I decided to create an intro for my Black Ops II videos, with each person having 4 seconds facetime
2013-09-08‎Ever edit something that is completely sexual innuendo on complete accident and then burst out laughing, uncontrollably? I just did...
2013-09-07‎@MinnesotaBurns you seem to have the most issues with uploading anymore.
2013-09-07‎So all I gotta do is not die in the next week and a half. Think I can pull that off.
2013-09-07‎The countdown begins. Ten days until the big 21. The one age I felt I'd never reach.
2013-09-07‎@TheArchfiend We're in the same boat. Never once watched a NCAAF game straight through.
2013-09-06‎@JulianWasHere Seriously, that song was touching...and I'm a guy haha love your vids dude. P.S Don't eat me =P (Randy)
2013-09-06‎New video, a funny Search &amp; Destroy compilation - http://t.co/GpsAj4UvDr
2013-09-06‎@JulianWasHere I've had Akbar stuck in my head for hours now lol
2013-09-06‎@MuscleRyan Nothing against you Ryan, but..I'm straight. Get over it.
2013-09-06‎@twwc960 Let's be realistic here...why would a guy I just met in a class two days ago, who I haven't said more than 50 words to, google me?
2013-09-06‎@freakshow180 That would be hilarious if it did, but I'd hope they wouldn't call you weird lol
2013-09-06‎"What's ironic as all hell out of all of this was the guy was wearing a ""Pioneers"" shirt, who I named my channel after. Da fuck?!"
2013-09-06‎I never bring up that I do YouTube videos to anyone really ever. So this has me scratching my head.
2013-09-06‎Now my greatest fear is becoming realized..how some of my videos are spreading through my classes from my instructor. If so..well..fuck.
2013-09-06‎Okay, explain to me how a guy I just met in class Tuesday found my YouTube channel? I never even once mentioned I do YouTube videos.
2013-09-06‎#tbt To celebrate back to football, here's a pic from Christmas (around 2004). Bro has a Vick jersey… http://t.co/eKzQBeDZyG
2013-09-06‎@MinnesotaBurns lucky for you with the NHL, as long as the lights don't go out you're fine lol
2013-09-05‎I think this can be a great video, just need some better clips, which I know I can get. Even if you aren't into COD, you should like this ;D
2013-09-05‎Well got some pretty good stuff so far. Going back to review some of it. The Whale definitely turned out better than the Frog portions.
2013-09-05‎@Ninja_Somewhere yes lol
2013-09-05‎@zoebeautyhaul this will be going on the main lol I only use Classics now for copyrighted material.
2013-09-05‎@Ninja_Somewhere but I don't care if you do lol will sound weird though in-pitched.
2013-09-05‎@Ninja_Somewhere I saw you pop in the one lobby where everyone left lol
2013-09-05‎Well, off to do some more Whale/Frog voices on Black Ops II. Excited to hear the reactions I get lol
2013-09-05‎@FNC *Slaps knee* XD  =P
2013-09-05‎Happy Birthday Freddie Mercury.
2013-09-05‎Seriously, Twitter NEEDS to get rid of this fucking chain reply shit. Good idea, poor execution.
2013-09-05‎@MinnesotaBurns I can imagine haha alright, I'll try to catch one down the road if I'm not working. Sucks working weekend nights.
2013-09-05‎@MinnesotaBurns Any live streams in the near future again? Never had a chance to get in a subs only lobby  ;D
2013-09-05‎@makemebad35 holy hell dude, I thought spending $60 on that Furby for Halloween last year was a lot.
2013-09-04‎@freakshow180 As if there aren't enough clues  =P
2013-09-04‎RT @freakshow180: I don't know you guys. I still think @PioneersProd is just an actor playing the real Randy who died in 2008...
2013-09-04‎@freakshow180 Well it's not my favorite (Just used a lot) lol Probably Impact and Geeza Pro.
2013-09-04‎@freakshow180 What about marker felt?
2013-09-04‎@ryoumymummy I'd never make it. Sweet wow. Middle school I always had to get up a little after 6.
2013-09-04‎I forgot what it feels like to get up at 8am. Ughh, not lovin it.
2013-09-04‎@twwc960 trust me, I know how bad I eat lol
2013-09-04‎I'm also bringing this up for the new skit involving Xbox. Too bad I can't use one program to do it all.
2013-09-04‎@freakshow180 The what now? lmao
2013-09-04‎Worth it in the end, but man is it frustrating. There's sometimes 4 different files, an hour or so in length in mic audio.
2013-09-04‎Makes it so it's not locked onto the footage. Sometimes I laugh or talk over something funny that happens, so having it separate is a must.
2013-09-04‎Find the tracks I need and re-aline them to the gameplay footage. The Elgato Live Commentary feature is nice but doing it separate
2013-09-04‎Never realized how much more work it is for COD videos to edit my mic audio separately. I gotta sift through over an hour's worth of footage
2013-09-04‎For my nutrition class I need to conjure up a 3 day food journal. Well..mines going to be the worst of the worst lol Taco Bell..Taco Bell..
2013-09-03‎Nothing is staged or scripted, all Live and legit. Just need to pitch voices afterwards so would sound pretty ridiculous Live lol
2013-09-03‎That's the new video that I'm going to try and get shot and out by this weekend. A Frog/Whale video on Xbox Live with legit reactions.

2013-08-24‎@JigsawdeadPage oh yeah lol a thousand.
2013-08-24‎Earlier this year I actually met the guy, but he didn't know I was the one who uploaded it. Still crazy even 2 years later it's requested.
2013-08-24‎I don't mention it much because it doesn't pertain to my videos at all, it was just something insane that happened that I had to upload.
2013-08-24‎It got my channel on Ray William Johnson's =3 and the video also appeared on truTV's Top 20 Most Shocking last October and Tosh.0.
2013-08-24‎This is the video - http://t.co/SNKzACBh8L  Happened two years ago in my grandparent's driveway. YouTube removed mine around August 2011.
2013-08-24‎"MTV called and are going to use that ""Truck"" video on Ridiculousness. I can't believe people are still contacting me to use that video."

2013-08-23‎@TekCrazy7 To your channel or you won't have an inbox. So stupid.
2013-08-23‎@TekCrazy7 So sick of that crap. I 'x' out of it almost every two days. It splits your channel into a G+, so you have to manually switch
2013-08-23‎Yeah I'm pretty sure with at least one out of a billion YouTube users  =P http://t.co/NQYuGbas6F
2013-08-23‎Smosh got over their $250k goal...well fuck.
2013-08-23‎@JigsawdeadPage He was headed to number 1 when I started doing videos. That was 5 years ago. Holy hell...
2013-08-23‎@JigsawdeadPage I know lol Cant believe the places he's gone just from talking to a camera in a pitched voice.
2013-08-23‎So Fred (Lucas Cruikshank) is gay. Can't say I'm surprised.

2013-08-23‎Those going back to school or just starting and/or moving away to college, best of luck to you! ;D
2013-08-23‎@MinnesotaBurns Shocked me how fast people recognized you. Literally two seconds into a game.
2013-08-23‎@MinnesotaBurns You got a lot of stuff to sift through for those first few 1 v 2's on Nuketown. Pretty sure they knew who you were though.
2013-08-23‎@MinnesotaBurns No idea how you get so lucky. First lobby and BOOM, modder lol

2013-08-23‎@Ninja_Somewhere It's fine lol I very rarely have upload issues so I'll let this one slide.
2013-08-23‎YouTube's being weird today and not letting me upload. Just quit about 70% through. Wouldn't even save my settings. Will try tomorrow then!
2013-08-22‎"Shows you,I took the SD card out before I exported the video, so my mic audio didn't finalize.The video's ""Hide and Seek"". Will be up later."
2013-08-22‎Went to upload a new Let's Play but then realized halfway through the upload my mic audio was missing, FUUUUUCKKKK!
2013-08-22‎It just thundered/lightning'd here like it does in the horror movies. Jeez Louise Taylor! I was literally seconds from sleeping and BANG!
2013-08-22‎@twwc960 And the Ustream shows barely anyone would show up. BlogTv was perfect. I can't even stream games because my speed is too low.
2013-08-22‎@twwc960 I'd love to do Live shows again but it's not the same without BlogTv. The YouTube Live I can't figure out

2013-08-17‎Tweet number 20,000. Man I'm so fucked waking up tomorrow. Gotta be out the door a little after 5am. I'll bring up the rear.
2013-08-17‎@TheArchfiend Have the channel name at the top and then three to five videos or so under it, so it's not scrambled and shit.
2013-08-17‎@TheArchfiend I never looked at the big page for subscriptions. No idea why they can't just switch back to the old system.
2013-08-17‎@imatu777 Kids still do this?? Da fuck?! There is still hope for this generation.
2013-08-17‎@MinnesotaBurns Makes sense now lol I just tuned in to watch and said you were offline.
2013-08-17‎@Taranthemaster Never expected him to pass Smosh. Then again, I don't watch his videos. Just shocked he has 11 million. Just insane.

2013-08-16‎@TheArchfiend Are you shitting me? .....FUCK.....
2013-08-16‎So if you message or tweet me, chances are I won't see it until the airport on the way back on Wednesday.

2013-08-16‎@twwc960 that's what sucks. I'll have so many to Instagram but will have to most likely wait till I get to the airport on the way back.
2013-08-15‎@ryoumymummy haha really? I'm giving it 4 hours once I get there.
2013-08-15‎The only downside to this trip is I literally have no tan on me. I'm gonna be a piece of toast when I get back. I'll do a before/after pic.
2013-08-15‎And a set-up video all on the gaming channel. Didn't have time to get a skit done.
2013-08-15‎Going on vacation to Cancun Saturday and probably won't have Internet until I get back Wednesday. So got a few gaming vids lined up.

2013-08-06‎@Ninja_somewhere Two months later I was addicted to Black Ops II. Just has much better color and detail compared to MW3. Ghost I think is
2013-08-06‎@Ninja_somewhere Gonna be hard to top Black Ops II in my opinion. I was so into MW3 last year and wasn't fond of the game when it came out.

2013-07-09‎Reaction Compilation for the Curse of Blackwater is up! - http://t.co/BGlHIcC4K5  Lots of funny reactions in this one.
2013-07-09‎I don't even know. Now I have over 320 GBs of free space after rebooting. Crossing my fingers nothing corrupts down the road.
2013-07-09‎I think....my Mac might have a virus...FUCKING PHENOMENAL!
2013-07-09‎But deleted the flashback recording folder with segments so that shouldn't be the issue anymore.
2013-07-09‎I couldn't even export a 6 minute video because there wasn't enough free space. I know my Elgato game capture software is partly to blame.
2013-07-09‎And I know that can't be possible. I want to see what's taking up the most space so I can delete it.
2013-07-09‎Anyone with a Mac know how to view files by size? Like on the hard drive (startup disk)? I just checked and only have 2 GBs of free space.
2013-07-09‎That shut me up pretty damn quick.

2013-06-25‎Honestly can't believe how nice it looks sometimes though, I just did it free hand with my mouse. No draw pads or anything.
2013-06-25‎Done drawing. Sweet god..that took me about 5 hours. Did it digitally in Photoshop. Turning out great so far. http://t.co/0DfLaymxZE
2013-06-25‎It's turning out though which is a good sign. I almost feel I included too much. Don't want to go much over 10 minutes.
2013-06-25‎This is exactly why I put off a Draw My Life for this long. I've been staring at a white screen for over 5 hours just drawing. Mah EYES!

2013-06-09‎@Ninja_somewhere lmao
2013-06-09‎@Ninja_somewhere and then I through that quote in the video and he ran into two more lol
2013-06-09‎"@Ninja_somewhere well he doesn't ""hate"" them lol was just because this one guy with the emblem kept killing him."
2013-06-09‎Damian was more of an inspiration in summer 2009. Tricky trivia on that one. &gt;;D
2013-06-09‎"Way back in 2008 when I started. I said ""guest"" starred, not starred lol I didn't see makemebad35's videos until around November 2008."
2013-06-09‎Answer: I stumped you guys big time on that one. Little tricky but actually it was @freakshow180 (James). He was an inspiration
2013-06-09‎"Pioneer Trivia, ""Who guest starred in Mr. Horse Head Meets Mr. Wooden Alligator 2, and has always inspired me to make YouTube videos?"""
2013-06-09‎A few of you got it right actually. Funny though, I don't even acknowledge I was in his video. Even two years later it's escaped my memory.
2013-06-09‎The man Charlie was run over by two trucks in my grandparents driveway. The video was pretty viral for a period.
2013-06-09‎Answer: Ray William Johnson. I bring this one up because the truck video actually happened on this day 2 years ago.
2013-06-09‎Pioneer Trivia time. What famous YouTuber's channel did I appear on back in June 2011 unintentionally?
2013-06-09‎RT @Ninja_somewhere: @PioneersProd The idea was basically to put everything I remember about your channel. And put it all in to one. And so…
2013-06-09‎Thanks @Ninja_somewhere for the fan art! I love this. http://t.co/U2TVy9iVmu

2013-06-08‎Got the new video edited and will be ready for tomorrow.
2013-06-08‎Tomorrow is my FIFTH year on @YouTube. 2008 seems like eons ago. I was just getting out of 9th grade. Now two years into college.
2013-06-08‎I got stabbed in the process. One of the craziest things I've ever seen. Even the trajectory.But then again, lots of kills don't make sense.
2013-06-08‎I'll show it in the next video I do. A simultaneous collision, shooting just to the side of the guy, through a wall into a guy who spawned.
2013-06-08‎I don't normally tweet about Black Ops II unless it's video related but I just had one of the most bizarre kills ever.One in a million shot.

2013-06-08‎@MuscleRyan I call bologna on that.

2013-06-07‎@Ninja_somewhere it's still confusing as all hell to me.
2013-06-07‎@freakshow180 I've done it lol and then I flipped back. Or maybe I woke up at the foot once.
2013-06-07‎The things I do to get things out on time...holy crap...it's a video I've wanted to do for nearly a year now.
2013-06-07‎Never thought I'd be filming a video at 3 in the morning. Just finished and really hope it was worth it.
2013-06-07‎"Just going to revert back to how it was. It says ""temporarily disband your channel from G+"". Guess that's what coming next. Fucking great.."
2013-06-07‎It used to be such a simple system @YouTube, now you got all of this G+ crap mixed in and it's as confusing as all hell.
2013-06-07‎Probably the fourth time they've made me do this. Even though I clearly click use your YouTube username over a G+ account with my real name.
2013-06-07‎There's that stupid split view on the top now where it says YouTube settings and Google Account settings. http://t.co/sz0QAM3vbH
2013-06-07‎It's not my main channel but my WorthlessToaster one. A box came up and I checked use a YouTube username, but it still created a fricken G+
2013-06-07‎So is YouTube now forcing you to link your channel with Google+? I don't even have an inbox anymore, wtf??!
2013-06-07‎@Ninja_somewhere Was it your video I saw or was that someone else's? Someone sent me a video response of them attempting it months back.

2013-06-06‎@makemebad35 Negativity? YOU? Get the hell out of here. I don't think I've ever seen someone criticize your channel (minus Fred stuff).

2013-06-05‎@makemebad35 What da fuck?? Yeah. That's so weird o.0
2013-06-05‎@Ninja_somewhere I use a terabyte drive which is huge. But I also have to put some of it on the computer itself to edit it.

2013-06-04‎Thankfully it's on the Xbox Arcade ; D
2013-06-04‎Tried recording it off of the N64 but the Elgato thought otherwise. Might be because its not an HD TV.Tv jutted the picture left and right.

2013-06-04‎@makemebad35 maybe it's because your skits took a turn to public trollin and the skits haven't had as well of views as you should get.

2013-06-03‎Being I spent a lot of money on setting up to record games, I wanted to use the shit out of it. Plus gaming videos are 10x quicker to edit.
2013-06-03‎For my main channel, which I know you obviously prefer. Especially with my 5 years coming up Sunday.
2013-06-03‎I'll be doing some N64 let's plays once I set that up. I've really grown a liking for gaming videos but that doesn't mean I stopped writing

2013-06-02‎@freakshow180 I know haha It's not fucked up, it's just plain creepy.
2013-06-01‎@Ninja_somewhere I just line up the audio afterwards. So it is actually Live.
2013-06-01‎@Ninja_somewhere The computer mic is awful and distorts. And Turtle Beach you can't always rely on with scratching sounds and such.
2013-06-01‎@Ninja_somewhere It actually sounds better through my Canon camera though. I do that for my Slender videos and all of the other gaming ones.
2013-06-01‎@Ninja_somewhere I'll have to use my Canon like I do for other gaming videos.
2013-06-01‎@Ninja_somewhere haha I do intend to do facecam stuff down the road for BO2. Elgato doesn't record my voice though which sucks.
2013-06-01‎@MinnesotaBurns Funny, I just posted a Running Troll video - http://t.co/iIx5QFxe7u almost the exact time you did lmao
2013-06-01‎I'll edit these a little more technical from now on, instead of just showing my POV. I'll show overhead view and such. Quality also higher.
2013-06-01‎@Ninja_somewhere For Turtle Beach if your mic's unplugged it's harder to hear so I always leave it in.
2013-06-01‎@Ninja_somewhere It seemed much louder in my Turtle Beach haha I had my mic in and everything and almost cracked there lol
2013-06-01‎"New video ""Running Troll Prank"" Black Ops II - http://t.co/iIx5QFxe7u  quality drained a little in this one but nonetheless enjoy!"
2013-06-01‎@Ninja_somewhere Yeah that;s on my list lol
2013-06-01‎Took me a good 3 hours to get any reactions at all. I literally ran for 4 good minutes in one last night and no one said a word.
2013-06-01‎New Black Ops 2 video will be out in a few hours where I attempt the Running Troll prank in One in the Chamber.Actually got great reactions.
2013-06-01‎I had one where I literally ran for at least 4 good minutes with the guy right on my ass but no one said a word. Really? You guys suck.

2013-05-24‎@The90sLife funny thing is I always wanted to play as Luigi.
2013-05-24‎The channel trailer should apply to not only those unsubscribed but to everyone in general. Not given a choice of random videos.

2013-05-24‎Game capture is up and running! And who said having a standard def tv would ruin it? Full HD! http://t.co/gtj3yLxlHN
2013-05-24‎@Ninja_somewhere And couldnt even install the computer software yet because my Mac is an older version than it requires which I'm DLing now.
2013-05-24‎@Ninja_somewhere Ah I see what you mean. Yeah I'll see when it's all set up. I had to buy some extra stuff because my TV is standard def.
2013-05-24‎@The90sLife Hell yuss! I used to call it Lorhell Kids.
2013-05-24‎@freakshow180 Apparently the version I have is Snow Leopard. Lion and Mountain Lion are versions over 10.7. I never knew of this stuff.
2013-05-24‎@Ninja_somewhere What do you mean? Set it up before I turn on the Xbox?
2013-05-23‎@freakshow180 haha oh man that'll be an experience I'm sure.

2013-05-21‎@markiplier And didn't realize until 2 days later it was my gmail that had an error with the shipping info. Oh well, that's the way it goes.

2013-05-21‎@markiplier Next Monday if you still pick up stuff weekly. Man I'm bummed. Paid extra and everything to have it shipped quicker.
2013-05-21‎@markiplier Tried having it express shipping on Friday but because mail isn't sent Sunday's it didn't make it. Oh well, guess you'll get it
2013-05-21‎@markiplier Foop, my package didn't get there on time. Ugh, had issues with the company that I didn't notice until two days later.
2013-05-20‎Thanks guys.
2013-05-20‎Plus having a Turtle Beach adds even more of a mess. Thought this would be easy street...not so....
2013-05-20‎Best bet is to look for a converter I guess. God does that piss me off. I can't really connect it to a computer anywhere else.
2013-05-20‎@RADICALisaac Plus I have a Turtle Beach so that's more cables to hook up.
2013-05-20‎@RADICALisaac probably the best bet. I really do not want to always have to move my Xbox downstairs just to record videos.

2013-05-19‎@markiplier You actually uploaded 6 hours of the stream? Now THAT'S dedication! That must've taken forever to render and upload!
2013-05-19‎@hawk4444 I thought it was a video chat app.
2013-05-18‎@markiplier I truly underestimated the power of your fan base. Congrats on reaching the goal! $20k is craziness!
2013-05-18‎@markiplier that's great news! I was hesitant thinking you'd reach it since it was much higher but awesome!

2013-05-08‎I couldn't get the channel networked in time. Takes a little over a month because I need stats for the network. I won't be uploading daily.
2013-05-08‎The reason I had to scrap it was because of my revenue sharing getting falsely denied on some of the videos, almost blocking my Ad Sense.

2013-05-08‎Here's the page where you can upload - http://t.co/RJoICUUn6z  I will be using them in the outros (and maybe intros) of my videos  :D
2013-05-08‎I'm shocked at how many fan art submissions I've been getting. Thank you all for putting time and effort into them. I luvs it!
2013-05-08‎@official_rubenn That I do, PioneersProd
2013-05-08‎@markiplier Too much cheese! http://t.co/QCF3qC2C4s
2013-05-08‎Summer break seems to be the time of year where I get my nostalgia attacks and end up buying movies I saw as a kid.
2013-05-08‎This has been stuck in my head all week - http://t.co/HyyUt8MxND  Forgot how good this movie was too...so I bought it on DVD.
2013-05-07‎More fan art by @Ninja_somewhere - http://t.co/nRbgr9fLRC  Me and my old car that I miss dearly.
2013-05-07‎They're rebooting the Powerpuff Girls this fall? I saw a picture and all I can say is..bu-huh (Hank Hill).
2013-05-07‎@Ninja_somewhere that's amazing!
2013-05-07‎@Ninja_somewhere yeah that's pretty neat! Glad you did it on something I really loved.
2013-05-07‎@kungfualice Henrik LIBRARIAN? Really Alicia? lmao
2013-05-07‎Jeez Louis Taylor! Just looked down and saw a big ass spider crawling on my hand!
2013-05-07‎@kungfualice I saw the 3rd period through overtime on Saturday. Crazy finish.
2013-05-06‎Okay I shall move it to another day because of people with finals.
2013-05-06‎Apparently YouTube's live stream has a 30 second delay so glad I strayed away from there.
2013-05-06‎So sign up for a username if you haven't already. I'll do them here - http://t.co/FfdDntKjwA
2013-05-06‎Well after a month since BlogTv shut down I'll do the first of hopefully many UStream shows tomorrow night around 7:30pm ET.
2013-05-06‎@markiplier oh jeez..hoping it's nothing serious and hoping for the best!
2013-05-06‎You want a show? Lock me in a room with a flyswatter, a wasp, and a video camera and you'll get a viral video.
2013-05-06‎@JasonWitten happy birthday, man!
2013-05-06‎The fact that I ate fast food about 4-5 days a week this past semester makes me question how I'm not dead or getting fatter. I must be dead.
2013-05-05‎@Ninja_somewhere I've heard four was the best.
2013-05-05‎@Ninja_somewhere MW3 was the first I played and then BO2. My brother always bought them but I think he sold a lot of them by now.

2013-05-05‎@markiplier and doing what you want to do. Congrats on 1,000.
2013-05-05‎@markiplier that was deep stuff, Mark. Never would've imagined the stuff you've endured. But the bottomline is you're happy
2013-05-04‎NHLs always been my second favorite sport though.
2013-05-04‎Years ago I liked the Yankees AND Blue Jays...same division lol
2013-05-04‎These three teams could be rivals for all I know, I have the tendency to do that in sports besides the NFL.
2013-05-04‎@TylerPatSteve3 you're a Rangers fan?
2013-05-04‎I'm a Stars and Penguins fan but Caps are my number 3 I guess.
2013-05-04‎Score already! Caps were all over the Rangers at the end of the 2nd. Overrrtimmme! #Caps
2013-05-04‎@Jamie_Levinkind no idea why that happens. It was a fricken web cam video.
2013-05-04‎I prefer the MW3 mechanics over BO2 but the I wish there were score streaks and custom emblems.
2013-05-04‎I've been so busy playing Black Ops II every night that I forgot how great MW3 is. Also how much DLC I paid for, I should play more often.
2013-05-03‎@freakshow180 I barely remember anything about marbles but we watched it in history through film.
2013-05-03‎@freakshow180 that was a weird movie. His dad was fucked up lol

2013-05-03‎@IsaacHarby My only complaint was when I first got them they really bothered my ears after wearing them for a couple hours. But have since
2013-05-03‎@IsaacHarby It's just the mic cables that are screwing up. They're separate from the headset at least.
2013-05-03‎@IsaacHarby You don't need to do that. I got the pair I have back in January so they're still relatively new.
2013-05-03‎"Awesome fan art I got in the mail today! All quotes from my videos revolving around ""FUCK"". Thanks Mallorie! http://t.co/5eaEQZ7VYA"

2013-05-02‎They're fuckin $20 for new ones (that's counting shipping). The first one had the angled end portion crackling and popping

2013-05-02‎@HeyCloverHey gaming videos saved.
2013-05-02‎@HeyCloverHey so not sure what to do. Also wanted to go back and focus on what got me this far which is doing skits. I still have the

2013-05-02‎@HeyCloverHey had my monetization disabled until I deleted the first few reaction compilations and it came back.  If my AdSense were to
2013-05-02‎@HeyCloverHey lots of issues monetizing videos, getting denied revenue sharing on videos I owned rights.
2013-05-02‎@markiplier I had issues getting logged in even though I already was. Uploading now and is fine.
2013-05-02‎@TheArchfiend people just automatically dislike videos within the first minute for no reason.
2013-05-02‎@TheArchfiend they should get rid of them. That way the thumbs up craze will die down a little.
2013-05-02‎So @reallesstroud is making more Survivorman, yess!!
2013-05-02‎@freakshow180 I fucking miss the Amanda Show.

2013-05-01‎@Ninja_somewhere I don't watch it on tv. Just look up the worst and best on YouTube.
2013-05-01‎@markiplier you finally got the bomb in the mail?
2013-05-01‎My music collection (new 2nd channel video) - http://t.co/Tb5JRB2gw3
2013-05-01‎@TheArchfiend That episode lacked. Idk, James just didn't seem to try hard in that one. Pretty hard though when you're working on a movie.
2013-05-01‎I'm late but congrats on a million subscribers AVGN @cinemassacre!
2013-05-01‎@TheZacMartin well it would take me a while to get to it. Got to focus on getting my channel moving again.
2013-05-01‎@freakshow180 I always forget about Nostalgia Critic for some reason. Need to go watch more of his work.
2013-05-01‎@freakshow180 I'll definitely need to watch that one. How does he get away with copyrights though?
2013-05-01‎@freakshow180 Wow that was actually really good!
2013-05-01‎@Brad13139 Do you believe anything you read on the internet? lol
2013-04-30‎@markiplier Also I was the one who sent you the Slendy Shot Glass  ;D
2013-04-30‎@markiplier Keep doing what you do with your videos Mark. I've been watching nonstop since November. Soon you'll hit a million  :D
2013-04-30‎@twwc960 I knew you were joking man lol There were a couple others who said similar things.
2013-04-30‎@The90sLife haha I miss this show so much.
2013-04-30‎"Why not just add ""Do drugs, you die"" while you're at it."
2013-04-30‎DEAD --&gt; Drugs End All Dreams. Yeah..that's a good sign to stick outside of an elementary school... o.0
2013-04-30‎Because with the gaming channel and everything there was literally NO WAY I had $0.00. But I scrapped the gaming channel nonetheless.
2013-04-30‎I thought something was wrong with my account for a second derrr!
2013-04-30‎Been literally STUCK at $0.00 earned today, yesterday, and for the month. Turns out YouTube moved the stats to the Analytic page a month ago
2013-04-30‎Okay, soo I'm an idiot. I've been scratching my head looking at my Google AdSense earnings for the last month and a half and it's
2013-04-30‎Bye Bye PioneersGaming.
2013-04-30‎@kungfualice okayy....I never knew you could add emotions to tweets. Wtf??!
2013-04-30‎@kungfualice holy smilies o.0
2013-04-29‎@markiplier you should buy a crusher for all of dem mail boxes! http://t.co/N9wtxJepwQ
2013-04-29‎@Ninja_somewhere still that is insanely fast.
2013-04-29‎@markiplier how the hell do you upload so fast?! It would take me 3 - 4 hours to upload an hour long video.
2013-04-29‎@TheZacMartin You mean for a collab?
2013-04-29‎@twwc960 I know lol I need to start up the Ustream shows soon.

2013-04-29‎@MuscleRyan lmao
2013-04-29‎Summer break at last!
2013-04-29‎Got up and vomited for a minute. I haven't thrown up since New Years of last year and that was from liquor. No idea what caused this.
2013-04-29‎Well this morning was scary. Woke up at 6am sweating with a foul taste in my mouth. Tasted like the salad I ate yesterday.
2013-04-29‎@freakshow180 You have to be in the mood for it.
2013-04-29‎I'll have to do a video on what music I listen to so you can see how weird my collection is.
2013-04-29‎@MuscleRyan Indeed.
2013-04-29‎@livinginthenorm I use a program called Audacity and change the speed, export it and put it on my iPhone as an MP3.
2013-04-29‎A prime example is Bohemian Rhapsody. I actually prefer it 4% faster. I listen to the original and (Freddie would kill me) it's too slow.
2013-04-29‎BUT, the downside to this is when you eventually go back and listen to the original speed it sounds SOOOO SLOOWWWW!
2013-04-29‎Not really chipmunky but fast and pitched. Just sounds cool. Especially if you're driving and in a hurry.
2013-04-29‎No idea why I do this but I like to change the speed on some songs I listen to. Like I'll change the speed up 30%.
2013-04-28‎@markiplier How long before your post office kicks you out? lol
2013-04-28‎@freakshow180 Computers it's not even properly aligned. Aghhh!
2013-04-28‎@freakshow180 The video portion isn't alined with the audio. I just down right hate writing scrips this way. And in the end, on different
2013-04-28‎@freakshow180 In and write shots for stilled images to coincide with the narration. A pain in the ass indeed. Especially when
2013-04-28‎@freakshow180 This one's for a documentary script which is five to ten pages. I had to do research on the thing and now paste the narration
2013-04-28‎And of course it's what I hate most, Audio/Video two column scripts for commercials, documentaries, etc.
2013-04-28‎One assignment left to finish...can..he...do it??! (last assignment for the semester)
2013-04-28‎@kiersten522 trust me I've been there lol I had to take bio in college which was mostly chemistry and I had to drop it because I was failing
2013-04-28‎@freakshow180 no finals. Projects due finals week. So got them done.
2013-04-28‎One more day of college and I'll be done with my second year. Holy shit.
2013-04-28‎@kiersten522 Trust me, you'll blink and it'll be over. I'm already heading into my 3rd year of college in fall.
2013-04-28‎@SmoshIan You guys travel a LOT.

2013-04-24‎Thank GOD! Finally was able to get a reaction compilation uploaded without YouTube denying my revenue sharing!
2013-04-24‎@Ninja_somewhere I have a plasma screen but it's downstairs.

2013-04-22‎@kungfualice =P
2013-04-22‎@freakshow180 I did no such thing!
2013-04-22‎@sonicfreak04 Muffled mono sound that the one out there has (which was actually from his website). Hope it surfaces eventually.
2013-04-22‎@sonicfreak04 But it's terminated now. Really would kill for a high quality download of Remember (quality from Fanning the Flames) not that
2013-04-22‎@sonicfreak04 Spongebob was always a favorite too but that's not Butch Hartman. I remember he had a site with music from the shows
2013-04-22‎@sonicfreak04 Got into the Fairly Odd Parents back in middle school and in high school Danny Phantom, ironically when I was 14 lol

2013-04-19‎@makemebad35 this issue? That's just ridiculous.
2013-04-19‎@makemebad35 you should start setting it up where you get emails when certain users upload new videos. After how many years you still have
2013-04-19‎@markiplier I bought something to send you for your mail videos but says it won't get there until Tuesday. Aghh!!

2013-04-19‎Well finally decided to switch over to the YouTube One layout - http://t.co/xPsWufXgnd  Better get used to changes I guess.
2013-04-19‎@freakshow180 it might just be because I stretched the image too much. It wasn't that big to work with.
2013-04-19‎@kungfualice I can't even fathom all of the chaos that's going on anymore.
2013-04-19‎@freakshow180 but...I did save it as a PNG! I always do lol
2013-04-19‎Looks like this might be the new banner for when I switch to the One layout. I feel so creatively robbed  =( http://t.co/OI73KKVxUF
2013-04-19‎@MinnesotaBurns Watch your six, enemy hockey team spotted.
2013-04-19‎That's the only fucking customizable thing to make your channel unique. Other than that...white, white, white, WHITE!!!!

2013-04-18‎@Ninja_somewhere my lvl? Rank? The what now?
2013-04-18‎@freakshow180 damn, man. You'd think college would be lenient.
2013-04-18‎@twwc960 I eat my damn vegetables  =P
2013-04-18‎@freakshow180 Trust me I fricken hate it too. I think my next big class is interviewing and stuff. And almost kicked out??
2013-04-18‎@Ninja_somewhere well if you're going to be playing often. Not forcing you to actually buy something.
2013-04-18‎@freakshow180 nowadays i STILL don't know. I hate news so don't to deal with that but is what I've had to deal with in college which blows.
2013-04-18‎@freakshow180 I must've changed my paths 5 times. Wanted to be an astronomer, meteorologist, news anchor, writer, web designer, and now COM.
2013-04-18‎@freakshow180 I think you would've made a great Algebra teacher based on how many times you took it  =P
2013-04-18‎@freakshow180 yeah I remember when you considered being a teacher. Could only image how that would've turned out lol
2013-04-18‎College is growing old on me. Why couldn't life be simpler.
2013-04-18‎I'm so tired of going through life being TOLD what to do. There's gotta be something better out there. Sick of school. Sick of people.
2013-04-17‎@Ninja_somewhere My brother tried getting me into Blink 182 but I need to look up more of their stuff.
2013-04-17‎@Ninja_somewhere I'm very particular. Most songs I add I stumble upon on complete accident. When people recommend i NEVER add it.
2013-04-17‎@freakshow180 Yeah that's an issue for me to lol Just depends what I'm editing. Like VO clips for Sucks videos and such I need silence.
2013-04-17‎@Ninja_somewhere It's really not a huge variety of music...well it is but stuff no one would even think of throwing on their iPod lol
2013-04-17‎@Ninja_somewhere I like some metal here and there. I'm just REALLY random with what music I like. Want to do a vlog on what I listen to but
2013-04-17‎@Ninja_somewhere Noo! I can't stand autotuned digital music. Rap is another I just don't have a taste for. Mostly classic rock.
2013-04-17‎@freakshow180 Yeah I have an editing playlist set up lol Like instrumental Beatles, Queen, etc songs and such.
2013-04-17‎If any of you guys were to ride in a car with me, you'd want to jump ship for the amount of times I repeat songs.
2013-04-17‎"@makemebad35 Fuckin ""I Want To Hold Your Hand"" (Beatles) and Worthless (Brave Little Toaster) I must've played 1000+ times."
2013-04-17‎@makemebad35 haha really? Sometimes it's soundtracks from movies/video games or just a song in general.
2013-04-17‎Like if I'm editing or doing computer work and such.
2013-04-17‎Idk about you but I have a crazy tolerance for listening to a song more than once. For as long as an hour on repeat.
2013-04-17‎@Ninja_somewhere Yeah but the new maps won't come up silly  =P
2013-04-17‎@89Kris Sorry to hear that Kris  =(  I lost my grandfather a few months back. Hope you're okay.
2013-04-17‎@Ninja_somewhere I'm guessing it booted you out when Encore started. You needs the DLC!
2013-04-17‎@Ninja_somewhere You sneaky bastard. I had to get off because I started lagging really bad. Even reset my Internet. I'll be on later.
2013-04-17‎I don't care what you say, the Titanic movie soundtrack (1997) is fricken epic!
2013-04-17‎@freakshow180 Holy christ. Never knew that. That's awful.

2013-04-17‎@markiplier I'm really not crazy for the One layout. It robs your channel of creativity!
2013-04-17‎I swear each day gets harder and harder to get up.
2013-04-17‎I kinda prefer maps like MW3 had. BO2 has great color and everything but there's too much stuff and places to camp.
2013-04-17‎@TheStupidWizard noo! Warm &gt; cold
2013-04-17‎Honestly I like the last BO2 DLC more than this new one. Idk, these new ones are ridiculously abstract.

2013-04-16‎RIP Pat Summerall. I'll never forget growing up listening to your voice on Madden '99 and on TV.
2013-04-16‎But nonetheless, the FINAL portion of hardcore Slender the Arrival is here - http://t.co/sjw5dclQps finally can put the game to rest.
2013-04-16‎@Ninja_somewhere I did! Somehow the state wasn't there. Even though everyone knows where Cincinnati is lol But had to fix that.
2013-04-16‎Shipping says 6-8 days. Really do not want to wait two weeks to see this in a video, efff!
2013-04-16‎If anyone watches Markiplier, you know about the new mail videos. So I decided to send something but has to get there by Monday morning.
2013-04-16‎Figures, the one time I buy something to send to a PO box for a video I get the shipping info wrong, delaying the shipment. AGHH!
2013-04-16‎@Ninja_somewhere But I mean I can't play it for 4 hours straight or anything unless I have friends online.
2013-04-16‎@Ninja_somewhere Well there's different game modes but I mainly just play hardcore kill confirmed.
2013-04-16‎@kungfualice Gaming channel once I get an HD-PVR. Need to research those more.
2013-04-16‎@kungfualice Now you can bitch more on BO2  ;D  Jk, I've never seen play throughs of that game though. May be something I can do for my
2013-04-16‎@Ninja_somewhere so it adds up. You're looking at over $105 for one game. Really outrageous.
2013-04-16‎@Ninja_somewhere well when you play it daily like me for a year it's worth $10. But yeah they do ask a lot. $60 for the game and like 4 DLCs
2013-04-16‎New Black Ops II maps, w00t!
2013-04-16‎@freakshow180 come on. That never stopped you when you'd race me to Cherinka's class back in high school! =P
2013-04-16‎".@makemebad35 (gets shot on BO2) ""Okay that is impossible! You have a better chance of finding an armadillo in a hamper""."
2013-04-16‎IMO they look better in standard def.
2013-04-16‎I spend hours making mine and to have shit like that happen it's like aghhh!!!
2013-04-16‎I play on a standard def. When I go on my plasma screen there's stuff I never saw before. Even colors seem a little different.
2013-04-16‎Making Black Ops II emblems are a bitch sometimes because I just realized they look different depending on the tv you're playing on.
2013-04-15‎@Ninja_somewhere There's too much negativity in the world today. It drives me insane.
2013-04-15‎Tragedy strikes.
2013-04-15‎Jumps on ship with the millions of others just for the hell of it for attention (not ALL do this). But I swear that's the thing to do when

2013-04-15‎@freakshow180 haha really? it's only on certain videos,
2013-04-15‎"Wtf is up with this ""Tape Mode"" though? That's a whacky feature lol"
2013-04-15‎Got custom thumbnails today so that makes up for it.
2013-04-15‎I take back what I said about YouTube (the monetization thing). Must just be glitchy with the new channel being partnered.

2013-04-14‎And then I get videos with revenue sharing flat out taken away for no reason WITHOUT explanation. I just don't know anymore....
2013-04-14‎Even my 2nd channel suffers, not just my gaming channel. Machinima takes a million years to get back to me and it's just automated shit.
2013-04-14‎I swear YouTube has a grudge against me with revenue sharing. I am beyond sick of getting videos denied for no reason.
2013-04-14‎@MinnesotaBurns Go home Burnsy you're drunk.
2013-04-14‎@freakshow180 Nothing he does will top Gangnam Style. But yeah I agree. This one just...lacked.
2013-04-14‎But I do appreciate everyone who has stuck around. It means I must still be something right.
2013-04-14‎Of me. Before college I would always get new ideas and get videos out regularly. These last couple years haven't been good.
2013-04-14‎I never make any progression. Just been STUCK. Which has let my motivation drop drastically. College had also sucked the life/creativity out
2013-04-14‎I feel like my YouTube channel is slipping down the tubes anymore. For the last year I gain subs and then lose them.Views haven't escalated.

2013-04-12‎I fear that if that keeps happening my entire AdSense could be disabled, which is linked to my main channel.
2013-04-12‎Machinima is taking forever to approve my channel. So I might take a break from posting PioneersGaming for a little while.
2013-04-12‎This is what I'm talking about with the revenue sharing getting taken away.YouTube never sends me an email as to why. http://t.co/eVmPyO7fWH

2013-04-12‎"New PioneersGaming ""Toward The Light"" - http://t.co/ggtDLnAL6P"
2013-04-12‎The option is completely gone. It's as if I don't have monetization enabled for my entire channel but just on that video.
2013-04-12‎Once again, YouTube removed revenue sharing on my gaming channel without explanation (Slender Arrival Hardcore Pt 1). No email or anything.

2013-04-12‎@freakshow180 And then when I heard the true quality of the songs I was like o.o  MUST BUY!
2013-04-12‎@freakshow180 Reason is because I didn't get a debit card until just last Spring. Didn't click until recently that I should buy legit.
2013-04-12‎Sweet wow, thanks @BlueIsleStudio for featuring my Slender The Arrival playthrough  :D
2013-04-12‎@freakshow180 Me and my brother share the same email address. Need to get that changed lol
2013-04-12‎@freakshow180 But obviously iTunes would be the more logical lol but I just use Amazon since it's under my own account. iTunes is weird b/c
2013-04-12‎@freakshow180 For years I've been downloading off of YouTube which the quality was awful. Recently started buying off of Amazon.

2013-04-05‎@markiplier The ending is a little different and you're more prone to getting caught in the challenges. Like in the Arrival portion.
2013-04-05‎@markiplier Slender Arrival on hardcore is well...harder. It adds a twist to the challenges in some portions. And yes your flashlight dies.

2013-03-23‎My dog is running in his sleep like crazy. I swear, sometimes I hear claw sounds on my living room door..it's him kicking it with his nails.
2013-03-22‎I'll have a new Amnesia play through out tomorrow morning.
2013-03-22‎Into a Slender reaction compilation down the road rather than worry about getting the monetization approved. Still waiting on networking it.
2013-03-22‎Only videos I still had issues with was The Arrival/Slender Space reaction comps (as well as my first Arrival attempt). I'll throw these
2013-03-22‎Sorry about all of the re-uploads on PioneersGaming (if you're subscribed to it). I'm pretty much done. Had to edit out music I didn't own.
2013-03-22‎@markiplier I haven't mailed anything in a decade 0.o
2013-03-22‎And it says I can't unclaim it. I've never had this happen before.
2013-03-22‎I don't want to make money off of a montage of clips I put together of another YouTuber. Da fuq?!
2013-03-22‎Okayy, somehow a video I put up got claimed/monetized but I didn't enable it. Howw?
2013-03-22‎@smpfilms Sometimes I wish it were 60s year round here in PA, but winter's okay...for two weeks and then I want summer back lol
2013-03-22‎A new Facebook layout? Wait..whaa??? I didn't even read anything on this coming - https://t.co/8MngiVFhZE
2013-03-22‎@twwc960 I haven't used Justin.Tv in four years lol That site probably changed a LOT.
2013-03-21‎Man, it's actually pretty complicated setting up a stream for TwitchTv than I would've thought. Glad I have a program already.

2013-03-21‎@freakshow180 how 'bout electric hole punchers lol
2013-03-21‎@CyberAceTV yeah I should to avoid issues like this happening and disabling my Ad Sense for no reason.
2013-03-21‎Picture from...preschool? #tbt #throwbackthursday http://t.co/R3IF2VOEHH
2013-03-21‎@CyberAceTV only my main channel.
2013-03-21‎Maybe networking the channel would help.
2013-03-21‎There's no music in it!! I removed it, don't understand why they're not getting approved right away.
2013-03-21‎YouTube's STILL giving me issues with monetizing some gaming videos. Been over 12 hours and wasn't approved yet on two videos.
2013-03-21‎So it's because they're only supporting the One layout anymore? You gotta be kidding me.Two weeks ago the layout is out and already forcing.
2013-03-21‎@dpnh The One layout by default. That's ridiculous that they took it away because of that. Layouts out for two weeks and already forcing.
2013-03-21‎@dpnh Are you serious?? Yeah I noticed when went to create the gaming channel again (because I thought my monetization was blocked) it was
2013-03-21‎It's not just on my main channel channel, it's on EVERY account I use. If it were a glitch you'd think it'd be fixed by now.
2013-03-21‎What is going on with YouTube removing the subscribers box on the channel page? Been gone for days now. http://t.co/VbR4dLoQuG
2013-03-21‎"New video from yesterday if you haven't seen it, ""If My Thoughts Could Be Heard!"" - http://t.co/9WjqPc17EP"
2013-03-20‎@makemebad35 And I've gotten that error before. Usually just wait a while and come back and it's fine.
2013-03-20‎@makemebad35 They just always magically disappear these days on EVERY video on every channel I use.
2013-03-20‎@makemebad35 I almost feel like putting in tags are a waste anymore. Every time I go into edit video after it's uploaded, tags are gone.
2013-03-20‎@mariolunaone I was shocked it still picked it up. Guess they're really on top of copyrights like that. I have been really careful lately.
2013-03-20‎This time around I guess lol SOOO glad I didn't use that music clip in my Amnesia playthoughs or I'd be FUCKED.
2013-03-20‎Damnnn...Oh well, as long as my account is still enabled. Even the reaction compilations I need to re-edit and upload. YouTube was generous
2013-03-20‎All of the Slender play throughs need to be re-uploaded with the ending montage/music cut out. Ughh, I should've learned.
2013-03-20‎So my Slender Arrival play throughs had to be scrapped. I'll re-upload them, just gotta cut the ending music out,so quality might be drained
2013-03-20‎@mariolunaone So thats a lesson learned lol
2013-03-20‎@mariolunaone With my screen recorder because there was no watermarks in the track. So thought it was a loophole but somehow got recognized.
2013-03-20‎"@mariolunaone So I had to buy a license for it. I'm not paying $30 for a fricken music clip. So what I did was record the ""preview"" of it"
2013-03-20‎@mariolunaone Well technically I didn't own it. I always use royalty free, which this track was BUT you had to pay $30 to get the track
2013-03-20‎@Ninja_somewhere It's not the games it was music. And yeah I was about to set that up. My main channel is partnered with them.
2013-03-19‎And obviously the same goes for YouTube videos.A second after a video is up, FIRST! SECOND! Aghh!Do people really have nothing better to do?
2013-03-19‎@Ninja_somewhere Within the first SECOND, there's 10 likes on it already.
2013-03-19‎@Ninja_somewhere Facebook's the same way. A status will get 20+ likes in 30 seconds. Then again companies like the NFL probably buy likes.
2013-03-19‎You know, I really don't get why people retweet someone literally TEN SECONDS after it was posted. Read the darn thing! You're not special.
2013-03-19‎@kungfualice that's cute lol how old?
2013-03-19‎My FINAL BlogTv show will be Monday, March 25th at 7pm ET on BlogTv of course - http://t.co/BaVHQtZMJg I'll do it 7 - 11pm ET.

2013-03-19‎@markiplier is markiplier@gmail your email?
2013-03-19‎So it was the wires on the battery that connect to it. They're loose so wasn't major. Need new connectors.
2013-03-19‎@dpnh I know. Hoping it's nothing major.
2013-03-19‎Five minutes later COMPLETELY dies. Unreal, I got the car barely a month ago. I was just to get back on the fricken interstate.
2013-03-19‎You are kidding me. Was at an intersection red light. Light turns green, car quits. Completely dies, comes back. I fly into a parking lot
2013-03-19‎FUUUUCKK! My car just died. Flat out died on me. Noooo!
2013-03-19‎New video out tomorrow, first legit one since Christmas! http://t.co/dnQnwq9uU8
2013-03-18‎@Ninja_somewhere Who knows lol
2013-03-18‎@twwc960 Very funny Dave...
2013-03-18‎That I should've thought of a long time ago that I do a LOT. This is a million view type of idea. Of course that won't happen lol but still.
2013-03-18‎At long last I am finally back to making a new legit video. Been since Christmas (not counting the last Sucks video). This is a golden idea
2013-03-17‎@Ninja_somewhere I don't have a top hat....
2013-03-17‎I really thought I could get through this no problem but every play through I get flat out stuck anymore.
2013-03-17‎Out, try for 20 mins, look up a video and the only thing I did wrong was place something out of order. I just..dfjsfhsdfk!!??!!!!
2013-03-17‎Amnesia just makes me want to rage quit anymore. Goddd...I don't mind a challenge but the whole game is a puzzle. I can't figure something
2013-03-17‎@makemebad35 just is more legit for me.
2013-03-17‎@makemebad35 just does it all live. No cuts or transitions. Those are more play throughs which I rather than just messing around.
2013-03-17‎@makemebad35 I guess and as you say you just want it funny instead of legit. Guess I'm just used to channels like Markiplier where he
2013-03-17‎@makemebad35 because you both have to play through it it would be too long.
2013-03-17‎@makemebad35 but you can't really keep attention with 15 min videos I guess.
2013-03-17‎@makemebad35 as more of a lets play. Just irritating sometimes when shots cut ahead and crop in.
2013-03-17‎@makemebad35 well one thing I would do but you probably can't is not cut it up. Just do it Live and play through it.
2013-03-17‎@mattmemelo you don't say? =P

2013-03-16‎@AlonDan Yeah been on there for 4 years. And you should have it. Go to your channel and above your video should be a blue ribbon saying
2013-03-16‎Guess I gotta talk at LOT louder.
2013-03-16‎Wow, so that mic I used, I didn't realize how bad my audio cut out. The sound is better but man...Just looked at a recording.
2013-03-16‎@AlonDan The upside to YouTube is it goes to your sub box, the downside the chat is the comment box. No chat box like Blogtv/Ustream etc.
2013-03-16‎@AlonDan I'm not transfering from BlogTv to there. I just don't like YouNow. Sticking with YouTube. Sucks BlogTv is shutting down.
2013-03-16‎@AeroLiger I know. Been on there for about 4 years and it just shuts down like that. Lot of good memories there.

2013-03-15‎But that's the way it is I guess.
2013-03-15‎It's a shame they're shutting down. Been bcasting there for about 4 years. YouTube just isn't as user friendly with their broadcaster.
2013-03-15‎YouNow just isn't the same. I'll do some final blogtv shows in the coming week(s).

2013-03-11‎I'm not paying $30 for a license and $30 for a music clip. That's horse shit.
2013-03-11‎Screen recorder since it played the music without watermarks in the  audio. Guess you need a license then for proof. Yyyeahh I'm an idiot.
2013-03-11‎The royalty free site I got it from I had to pay $30 for the damn song. THIRTY...DOLLARS for a 60 second song. I just recorded it with my
2013-03-11‎Turns out the reason my gaming videos havent monetized is probably the fricken song I used at the end. Come on I thought I found a loophole!

2013-03-10‎So YouTube rejected revenue sharing on my Slender video. Wtff?! Haven't had this happen in years. My only guess is the music but

2013-03-08‎@dpnh Doesn't matter if I can go back now, they'll force it on everyone eventually. I just did it to my 2nd and Classics channel to mess
2013-03-08‎@dpnh It's just one big block face and videos take it all up. Plus being EVERYTHING is white makes it worse.
2013-03-08‎@dpnh Idk, I get that they want to make it all about the videos but that's all you see. There's nothing dividing things up.

2013-03-07‎@IsaacHarby Slender Space is, yes.
2013-03-07‎@markiplier Isn't Slender The Arrival supposed to be supported by PS3?
2013-03-07‎@markiplier Always seen you play computer games so would be cool to see other consoles. Look forward to it!
2013-03-07‎@IsaacHarby You collect power nodes instead of pages. Slender mechanics are completely different. He actually moves.
2013-03-07‎@IsaacHarby Dead Space with Slender in it pretty much. Never played Dead Space so don't know what's taken from it.
2013-03-07‎Beat Slender Space - http://t.co/quBI4tXh6Z
2013-03-07‎The creator of Slender Space saw my let's play lol Ohh boy.
2013-03-07‎The game itself looks great. Can't wait for the full release. I'll do a LP of it when it is finally out.
2013-03-07‎Somehow managed to find my way and around and beat the beta (Slender The Arrival). THANK YOU UNLIMITED SPRINT!
2013-03-07‎@kungfualice the silliness in it.
2013-03-07‎@kungfualice haha that was one of those moments where it just sounded wrong lol Had no one started laughing I wouldn't have caught
2013-03-07‎"@kungfualice Now you listen to me. I just went out myself and bought two DORITOS tacos with mah own monayyy. I'm too ""cool"" for cool ranch."
2013-03-07‎@5FDPboyyy Yeah I've seen a playthrough of it but playing it is what really shows how the game is. Looked great.
2013-03-07‎@5FDPboyyy Even in the BETA he saw others? Damn!
2013-03-07‎FINALLY got Slender The Arrival for Mac out, thank the lord! Haven't been able to play it yet!
2013-03-07‎Anyone try the Cool Ranch tacos from Taco Bell yet?
2013-03-06‎New video SLENDER SPACE | SCARIEST ONE I'VE PLAYED! - http://t.co/AbVaTO3tQI
2013-03-06‎God do I hate dreams where I get shot. Fuckin hurts!
2013-03-06‎@TheArchfiend Wow is all I can say. At least they're getting cancelled.
2013-03-06‎@IsaacHarby Not sure if you were in there. I don't check Twitter/FB much when I'm streaming because it lags. Just got off.
2013-03-06‎Now off BlogTv, thanks for those who watched as always  ;D
2013-03-06‎Live streaming now on BlogTv - http://t.co/BaVHQtZMJg  Stop in and chat for a while :D
2013-03-05‎@twwc960 I'll be on for a few hours as usual lol
2013-03-05‎@AlonDan @smpfilms I bet you guys would make an epic collab together. Would be hilarious seeing Cory animated.
2013-03-05‎"New ""Sucks"" video from yesterday if you haven't seen, ""Food Industries Suck"" - http://t.co/WKbSy5wn8x"
2013-03-05‎@TheArchfiend They FINALLY removed the ability for wall posts on their Facebook page.
2013-03-05‎Live show tonight on BlogTv 7:30pm ET - http://t.co/BaVHQtZMJg People seem to prefer them there so I shall deliver.
2013-03-05‎@HeyCloverHey lol It's a start  :D
2013-03-05‎@markiplier You missed this in Slender Space. They sing lol http://t.co/hXh7cHPAie
2013-03-05‎Wow, haven't slept in this late in a long time. For some of you 1:30 is normal lol usually get up at 11.
2013-03-05‎1:31 is just impossible not to laugh.
2013-03-05‎Can't...stop...laughing..at..markiplier - https://t.co/Rg1BForWTr
2013-03-05‎@freakshow180 I was tempted to at reply you but figured it was best to let you work lol I actually had an assignment due today &amp; Im on break
2013-03-05‎@dpnh @89Kris Thanks for the RTs guys  :D
2013-03-05‎RT @markiplier: Watch this! It's hilarious! And features me! http://t.co/qLUEYsTKsy
2013-03-05‎My only concern is the length of it. Don't like gaming videos to go over 15 mins.
2013-03-05‎I'll just put them out between normal videos, days after.
2013-03-05‎I know Amnesia is one that was suggested a lot. I love gaming videos but don't feel I need to make a separate channel for them.
2013-03-05‎Recorded it and will upload in the coming days. If you like my gaming videos, suggest other scary ones (MUST be available for Mac).
2013-03-05‎Just played Slender Space and got the shit scared out of me. That is by far one of the scariest Slender games I've ever played.
2013-03-04‎@MinnesotaBurns That's pissing me off too. Everything is bold. At least it's not the phantom message glitch, but you'll never get that lol
2013-03-04‎"New video, ""You Know What Sucks?! - Food Industries"" - http://t.co/WKbSy5wn8x"
2013-03-04‎"New ""Sucks"" video uploading today. Around 3pm ET. Be on the look out."
2013-03-04‎"New ""Sucks"" video out tomorrow afternoon. A shorter one being there's not much to say but something I've wanted to hit for a while now."
2013-03-04‎@freakshow180 No idea. Maybe I've been registered longer? I at reply a lot of people.
2013-03-04‎@freakshow180 ...I have double that...
2013-03-04‎@freakshow180 I know lol They keep deleting their replies though which means they're wusses.
2013-03-04‎@freakshow180 Welp, Onision/EmptysAwesome 2010, TheArchfiend/Nick Studio 10 2013 lol
2013-03-03‎Lots of blurring out in this new Sucks video. Don't want to get sued lol
2013-03-03‎I just smacked myself in the head twice with the visor/mirror in my car. &amp;@$&amp;&amp;$!!?!
2013-03-03‎@freakshow180 What, a man of the lower class?  =P
2013-03-03‎@kungfualice okayy...LOVE!  =P
2013-03-02‎@kungfualice you've really taken a liking for hockey haven you lol
2013-03-02‎"New ""Sucks"" video will be out around Monday. Anyone on Spring Break yet?"
2013-03-02‎Just another one of those writing video scripts at 2:30 in the morning moments. Only took me five minutes  0_0
2013-03-02‎This has got to be the absolute worst show Nick has ever made. I'm not even kidding.
2013-03-02‎Well whoever is monitoring the Nick Studio 10 Facebook page is going to be fired. http://t.co/f4EH1Ifv0h
2013-03-02‎@TheArchfiend Well whoever wrote back is going to be fired. The post is gone now. http://t.co/1AdhLrE8b3
2013-03-02‎@freakshow180 I'm not a huge lover of cool ranch doritos soo...no.
2013-03-02‎Just had @TacoBell three days straight. I should start sponsoring Doritos Tacos for how often I get them haha
2013-03-02‎@TheZacMartin where'd that come from? I didn't even mention Damian lol
2013-03-01‎His channels been growing like crazy. Probably my second favorite youtuber.
2013-03-01‎That's Mark lol check out his channel http://t.co/Bv1joMkSzZ
2013-03-01‎Cheezit WIN http://t.co/ldwLHpOkai
2013-03-01‎Every time I see a box of Cheezits I can't help but think of @markiplier lol Seriously, he was on their front page.
2013-03-01‎@kungfualice that's a Monday face!
2013-03-01‎New video showing you my new car. Finally got around to it  :D - http://t.co/mMF6y0SpVE
2013-03-01‎No idea why this happens when I image map my banners anymore for YouTube. Look how far off I have to place the box! http://t.co/99MYwZGMZH
2013-03-01‎"RT @FabFourFacts: ""I  swear to God or swear to Mao or anybody you like, I had no idea it spelled LSD."" - John Lennon on ""Lucy in the Sky ..."
2013-03-01‎Funny glitch I found messing around with Slender Prison - http://t.co/7R2owKQA2T
2013-03-01‎New Slender Carnival video if you haven't seen it yet - http://t.co/0Bex5Z0hLy
2013-03-01‎@twwc960 I would've gotten the Subaru had my brother not wrecked his car two weeks ago. Actually glad I got the Dodge.
2013-03-01‎Just got gas and noticed I saved $15 compared to my Altima. Damn Dodge you is great!
2013-03-01‎@freakshow180 Haha wow. Was that an independent film or something?
2013-02-28‎@freakshow180 When the hell was this made?? - http://t.co/NK5aYRAIBR.  Might need the period in the link at the end there.
2013-02-28‎I'll be revisiting these maps between regular videos. The screen captures have been drastically improved. No more laggy videos.
2013-02-28‎New video where I return to Slender Carnival - http://t.co/0Bex5Z0hLy  The difficulty has been raised TREMENDOUSLY!
2013-02-28‎@markiplier Mark, this will help you with Carnival - http://t.co/0Bex5Z0hLy  I showed alternate spawn locations in this one, 8/8.
2013-02-28‎So tired of waking up with a sore throat. Been over a week trying to get rid of this head cold!
2013-02-28‎@IsaacHarby Which is why I'm glad most Slender games are made in the Unity Engine (Mac &amp; PC compatible).
2013-02-28‎@IsaacHarby the Beta? I read a lot have that problem. I tried it on my Windows 7 and couldn't even move. I just prefer Macs.
2013-02-28‎"Also they shouldn't be ""darkened"" anymore. YouTube had a habit of making the recordings darker making it harder to see for some reason."
2013-02-28‎So you are guaranteed to see me stressed lol Already recorded three of them.
2013-02-28‎Privatized the older ones from when I did one a day for two weeks since they were poor recordings. Also the difficulty levels were raised.
2013-02-28‎So no more jutted, laggy, shaky captures  :D  Going to be putting out Slender Shadows playthroughs between videos in the coming weeks.
2013-02-28‎The BETA version that is. The full game won't be out for another few weeks. Finally figured out how to improve screen recording performance.
2013-02-28‎Surprised Slender The Arrival isn't out for Mac yet. Come on, I is dyinggg!
2013-02-27‎I think I'm in heaven - http://t.co/E55mGVSaPK
2013-02-27‎@freakshow180 In college you have the freedom to do that  =P
2013-02-27‎Seriously I never knew you could unlock that on that game.
2013-02-27‎That I never got GOLD on before. Never knew it unlocked an extra mode where it mirrors the courses. I can die happy nowww...
2013-02-27‎Finally, after ten years I beat all of the Mario Kart 64 cups with GOLD. Haha swore I did it before but turns out it was just the Star cup
2013-02-26‎@freakshow180 I saw him once when I was helping shoot a video in the lobby in there. He totaled his now??
2013-02-26‎@freakshow180 That parking lot is where I wrecked my car (in front of the advanced tech center by the bridge).
2013-02-26‎@freakshow180 Strange, I remember this video but not the bridge in there lol I still say this is your best work.
2013-02-26‎@markiplier How about finish Slender Carnvial  &gt;:D
2013-02-26‎@freakshow180 On the bridge?
2013-02-26‎The journey begins. http://t.co/IubRCplrFe
2013-02-26‎@mattmemelo Now how the hell can you make and write music at 8am??!
2013-02-26‎@mattmemelo so always need extra time which blows when you're in a hurry or oversleep which I do a lot.
2013-02-26‎@mattmemelo Monday through Thursday my morning classes are at 9:30 or 10:30 so I've had to wake up at 8 and 9. It's a 25 mile drive
2013-02-26‎@JeremyTroyStair try three straight days of Taco Bell then we'll talk  =P
2013-02-26‎@mattmemelo of having to get up early all last month (car and such).
2013-02-26‎@mattmemelo I can't even sleep to 11:30 anymore since last month. My body just wants me awake at 10. Sucks because
2013-02-26‎But this is something that pisses us all off. So I'm gonna do it.
2013-02-26‎"Got an idea for a new ""Sucks"" video but there's not much to say about it. I tried writing the idea months ago but got stuck. Lets try again!"
2013-02-26‎@freakshow180 I hate freckles. I get a little on my face in summer. At least I'm not a ginger.
2013-02-26‎Just gotta get through this week and it's Spring Break which I desperately want lol two more days.
2013-02-26‎Enjoying the new car. Would've filmed a 2nd channel video of it yesterday but the sun was already down. I will tomorrow.
2013-02-26‎@JeremyTroyStair Coming  =P
2013-02-26‎@twwc960 :D
2013-02-25‎My new wheels. 2005 Dodge Neon. Gonna take me a WHILE to get used to this. http://t.co/9HD4R5QtrM
2013-02-25‎@markiplier Mark, this will help you with Carnival - https://t.co/BuJxWXFGUX  I beat it shortly after it came out. Hope it helps.
2013-02-25‎Getting the new car tonight, 2005 Dodge Neon. Finally will be able to get back to happy fun times.
2013-02-25‎@kungfualice good thing I didn't just read this in class or I would've lost it hahaha
2013-02-25‎@freakshow180 that's all I'll remember him as.
2013-02-25‎@freakshow180 really? That surprises me. Yeah Adele def.
2013-02-25‎@freakshow180 Ted didn't get any awards did it?
2013-02-25‎@freakshow180 hahaha I just instantly thought of your reaction to that lol
2013-02-25‎The vocal cords on her #Oscars2013 #JeniferHudson
2013-02-24‎And on fire...
2013-02-24‎Chowing down at Quaker Steak and Lube. I'm sloppy... http://t.co/YiyqOJ5Cjd
2013-02-24‎Going to the Quaker Steak and Lube for dinner. Got some of the hottest wings there.
2013-02-24‎@MinnesotaBurns Don't follow NHL much but like the Stars. Not sure if they're doing good.
2013-02-23‎"If you should ""never mind"" then why do we do it?"
2013-02-23‎@twwc960 it was too small to me though. My Altima was nice. Had lots of room.
2013-02-23‎@Ninja_somewhere lmao
2013-02-23‎@twwc960 my brother just had the 2004 cav (wrecked it). Yeah I'll post it Monday.
2013-02-23‎@kungfualice earmuffs!
2013-02-23‎The car situation is settled. Getting a 2005 silver Dodge Neon Monday night.
2013-02-23‎@freakshow180 seeing The Beatles perform =P
2013-02-23‎@makemebad35 at least you weren't hearing gun shots in your head or I'd say no more COD before bed.
2013-02-23‎"New 2nd channel video, ""I Failed Geometry?!"" - http://t.co/bDAQcRvlKE"
2013-02-23‎If you've seen older SMP Films videos then chances are you've heard his music before.
2013-02-23‎In my opinion. Thanks Nick Wills and others who helped release this album. I've purchased all of his albums and this one is great.
2013-02-23‎"Really hard to believe its been almost 7 months since he died.This is album is almost just as good as the ""Dreaming"" album which is his best"
2013-02-23‎"Just downloaded Nathan Wills' ""Angel"" album. I think are tracks he never really mastered fully or released (demos)."
2013-02-22‎@twwc960 I just don't care =P
2013-02-22‎That NEVER happens when I miss things.
2013-02-22‎I miss my car so much that I actually had dreams where I took it for its final drive and ones where I woke up to the back portion fixed.
2013-02-22‎@FNC Really? haha Glad you enjoy them  =)
2013-02-22‎Going ANYWHERE. I guess I just took the drop in views too seriously. I'm here to stay.
2013-02-22‎Alright, I have no idea what I was thinking. I mean..LEAVE YouTube for a MONTH? I can't do that to you guys. From this point on I'm not
2013-02-22‎Not saying that's the only reason I've lost so many but that is a baaddd bad glitch YouTube...
2013-02-22‎Of the reasons I'm losing subscribers so much anymore. Already found out this has happened to me and a few others. GREAT.
2013-02-22‎So great, apparently I'm being forced unsubscribed to channels I've been subscribed to without even knowing. That could be one
2013-02-21‎@markiplier wish mine was that fast. Don't know how to check.
2013-02-21‎@nfl not saying anything.
2013-02-21‎@kungfualice More like drug eyes  =P
2013-02-21‎Haven't put out a pic of Bruno in a while. This one's a few weeks old, forgot I snapped it. http://t.co/iqeL6BCcHh
2013-02-20‎Well haven't been sick in a while. Damn youu winter.
2013-02-19‎@kungfualice things can only get better here on out.
2013-02-19‎@kungfualice thanks. Just trying to get through this week. Trying my best to stay positive. Just hard when my whole house is a wreck.
2013-02-19‎@freakshow180 The race around the world hahaha
2013-02-19‎@mattmemelo Under settings you should see it near the bottom of the page. Says download your twitter archive or something along those lines.
2013-02-19‎It downloads as a ZIP file where you can sift through tweets by month for your year of choice.
2013-02-19‎@freakshow180 Mine was instantaneous so I the file right away. Not sure if yours will be the same.
2013-02-19‎It's pretty much exactly like Facebook's Timeline. It's under settings.
2013-02-19‎Anyone download their Twitter Archive? Finally got it for my account. Can't believe some of my tweets from when I first signed up.
2013-02-19‎Just want this car thing settled.
2013-02-19‎We know a guy who buys the cars &amp; fixes them up for good prices so thats probably the route to take. Strange having to get two cars at once.
2013-02-19‎Looking into Chevy Cobalts. Don't look too bad of cars.
2013-02-19‎@freakshow180 Ramen is good!
2013-02-19‎@markiplier Proud of you man! Very interesting news segment. Sorry about your dad.
2013-02-18‎@twwc960 It was half since I backed into a truck behind me. So it was a 3 car fender. My brother hit an SUV head on pretty much. Both go up.
2013-02-18‎@twwc960 gonna go up though.
2013-02-18‎@hawk4444 @livinginthenorm I'm sorry about our pasts. Just want to get this out. With everything going on I just lost my grip on things.
2013-02-18‎All I care is none of us were hurt or hurt the other drivers. Both of our cars totaled.
2013-02-18‎Racked up $7500 in damage combined to mine and my brothers car in a week and a half. $3400 for mine, $4100 for his.....
2013-02-18‎@markiplier I'd sleep to 1 every day if I could.
2013-02-18‎I was just about to buy my car this morning. Unfricken believable. Both drivers were okay bottomline. This is just a nightmare.
2013-02-18‎I honestly can't fathom how bad this year is. Not even two weeks after I totaled my car, my brother just wrecked and totaled his last night.
2013-02-18‎@dpnh And years from now we'll be saying similar things haha
2013-02-18‎@twwc960 Yeah I've heard of twitch. Seen markiplier on there once. Have to look into it. Already have an account but never broadcasted.
2013-02-18‎@dpnh So glad they finally released this. Most I don't ever remember tweeting but then again it was back in 2009.
2013-02-18‎@dpnh You're not alone man haha I seemed to have had a habit of repeating tweets days later. They were really short and choppy ones.
2013-02-18‎@dpnh Been trying to do this for years. Finally got my account approved.
2013-02-18‎@dpnh I forgot about the new Twitter archive! Was gonna say I probably have too many tweets to use those websites to search my first ones.
2013-02-18‎...yeah... X( http://t.co/P2NOOKuf
2013-02-18‎@freakshow180 Thought smosh would've been up there. They're number one on YouTube for god sakes.
2013-02-18‎@freakshow180 haha So you're saying it was good but...the same old, same old.
2013-02-18‎@freakshow180 I don't think I've once watched the Streamys.
2013-02-18‎If you missed the show, I have it unlisted here - http://t.co/IDG5Raqz
2013-02-18‎Hmm..some of it looks a bit buggy but nonetheless it worked pretty well. I'll try to do more in the future!
2013-02-18‎Only downside is I couldn't play and look at the chat simultaneously.
2013-02-18‎Thanks for those who watched! That was different. I'll have to review the footage to see how the gameplay looked.
2013-02-18‎Live now, playing some Slender games live - http://t.co/K4l82TWd  I'll start at 8pm ET stop on in!
2013-02-18‎Think I figured it out.
2013-02-18‎Aghh damn, I thought I'd be able to broadcast my webcam and desktop simultaneously with Camtwist.
2013-02-18‎Live show at 8pm. Going to play a few Slender games Live. Stay tuned for link.
2013-02-17‎NO “@meelzdiva17: @PioneersProd hey randy, u should do a Harlem Shake video”
2013-02-16‎@kungfualice grandfather and a friend passed away. Just a horrible year.
2013-02-16‎@kungfualice YouTube channel isn't doing well. Job is pissing me off.
2013-02-16‎@kungfualice just been a lousy year for me. 13 being my least favorite number (unlucky) its 2013. Just nothing has gone well for me lately.
2013-02-16‎@kungfualice that, sleep deprived 3 weeks, yard caving in, my routine. Life's just not treating me well right now.
2013-02-16‎Miserable.

2013-02-14‎What are your favorite love songs? Happy Valentines Day!
2013-02-14‎@MagicofRahat lol better than McDonalds.
2013-02-14‎@markiplier sorry I'm straight =P
2013-02-14‎@meelzdiva17 I'm thinking its just the cool dry air.
2013-02-14‎@meelzdiva17 because I really did throw out my voice for the next day after I shot.
2013-02-14‎@meelzdiva17 I would know if I was dehydrated. Been scratchy the past couple days. Just figured it was from yelling too much.
2013-02-14‎@Ninja_somewhere Are you serious? Damnn man. Never heard of that happening =[
2013-02-14‎@Ninja_somewhere whenever I'm sick it's almost always in around early March. Getting close lol
2013-02-14‎But I filmed last Wednesday. Or just the weather? Idk.
2013-02-14‎It's weird because this happened two years ago when I last threw out my voice making a video. I got sick afterwards.

2013-02-12‎@makemebad35 Videos because of music. Even our first video you and I did, that old Q&amp;A one. Had Raunchy in the intro. So
2013-02-12‎@makemebad35 Damnnn man, all of your earlier Torturer videos?! That's why I'm super careful with music. I had to delete a few of my older
2013-02-12‎@ThatOneNugget Thanks for stopping by! That's a long time!
2013-02-12‎Thanks for those who stopped by! Show was fun.
2013-02-12‎@makemebad35 Still it's copyrightable music. Surprised you got away with it for this long.
2013-02-12‎@makemebad35 Rotten luck man. At least you never got banned for too many infringements losing over 100 videos.

2013-02-11‎@twwc960 I'm not an expert on cars.
2013-02-11‎@twwc960 Well it isn't my choice it's my parents decisions. Not sure how expensive or cheap Focus' are. Need a good 4 wheel drive.
2013-02-11‎@twwc960 looking into Subaru's. Saw one I liked today. Just up to my parents on the decisions.

2013-02-11‎Downloaded Slender: The Arrival and it lagged horribly. Guess I gotta wait for the Mac version. You'd think they'd release simultaneously.
2013-02-10‎@IsaacHarby Ah really? Never played it. Not sure how big it will be. They have compatibility info on the site where you go to purchase.
2013-02-10‎@IsaacHarby Its only a beta though so its not anything like the game will be.The actual game has a story and everything. It's like a remake.
2013-02-10‎@IsaacHarby Is great. It will def. be worth the money being it's a higher level production company they teamed up with.
2013-02-10‎@IsaacHarby Yeah, it's only for PC right now which sucks for me but you have to pay for this one. They let you pick how much though which
2013-02-10‎RIP Car - http://t.co/Vha3tVpZ  Not easy losing it. Decided to put a montage together from the times it appeared in my videos.

2013-02-10‎@89Kris that's where I took it to.
2013-02-10‎@89Kris yeah that the fan everything coming out of the vents.
2013-02-09‎@89Kris and of course the back.
2013-02-09‎@89Kris my fan for my air wasn't working except on 4. Front bumper had a scrape on it.
2013-02-09‎Crazy how many videos my car was in. Putting a video montage up tomorrow.
2013-02-09‎So they're totaling it. I can't believe this. I loved that car so much.
2013-02-09‎So my car is going to cost $3400 to fix. GOOD...LORD.
2013-02-09‎@freakshow180 soo many memories with this bottle... http://t.co/rZDu8Z7I
2013-02-09‎Go to leave work in my dad's truck, door is locked. Tap on the door, about a foot of snow falls off the roof of the store onto me.
2013-02-09‎@dpnh idk, YouTube just isn't what it used to be anymore.
2013-02-09‎@dpnh nowadays if I go to edit video settings my tags aren't even visible. There's nothing there which makes me wonder if they really save.
2013-02-09‎@dpnh I don't look at my earnings much but losing views kills your channel. I've lost lots of views over the months. Everyone has.
2013-02-09‎@dpnh they're just lousy changes anymore. Especially for a site where changed affect revenue you make.
2013-02-09‎@dpnh I know that I complain a lot about the changes. They're wrecking our views and sub boxes with each change.
2013-02-08‎Seriously I might tear up if its totaled lol so many memories with that car.
2013-02-08‎I really love my car. REALLY hoping its not totaled from that. Had around 178k miles on it.
2013-02-08‎Well getting the car looked at. Damage is so complex they can't even give me an estimate.
2013-02-08‎So last night in my dream my mom asked if I wanted a piece of cake. I shoved the entire thing in my mouth. Tasted damnnnn good!
2013-02-08‎@JigsawdeadPage they haven't been the same for years.

2013-02-07‎@TheTadambag101 I remember I was online but must've been on the other team. Honestly I don't know what happened.
2013-02-07‎You know...the irony in all this is today I got a discount for safe driving. Yeah...... FUCK.
2013-02-07‎"@meelzdiva17 scary stuff though. There's always a ""what if"". But what are you gonna do."
2013-02-07‎@meelzdiva17 he was wayy more nervous than I was. We're all insured. It happens. I was shaky but able to get it under control.
2013-02-07‎@freakshow180 yeah it could've been loads worse. In a way glad it happened. Never been in a situation like that firsthand.
2013-02-07‎But my car got all of the damage. The trucks bumper broke off halfway. Guy who hit me just got a scratch.
2013-02-07‎Happened so quick couldn't even honk.
2013-02-07‎Since I shifted to reverse to back up he hit me as my foot hit the gas causing me to hit a truck behind me.
2013-02-07‎I'm okay bottomline. It was a 3 car bump. Guy in front of me backed up to get to a space he missed and hit my front.
2013-02-07‎My bumper rather. Guy backed into me causing me to hit the gas into a truck behind me. http://t.co/kRB7kvhX
2013-02-07‎Well got into my first fender bender. My trunk is fucked.

2013-02-05‎@freakshow180 http://t.co/FLkmqG5K
2013-02-05‎@freakshow180 But I never heard of them. I'm still new to networks but just a video that attracted attention like THAT? I'm confused.
2013-02-05‎"@freakshow180 Called ""Node"". Their channel is legit and all. Freddie Wong and others are a part of a weekly series on it."
2013-02-05‎It only has 111 views. This baffles me.
2013-02-05‎Okay..I really find it hard to believe that a video I put up 3 days ago has a network interested in partnering me. Wtf?!
2013-02-05‎I always regret having 9:30/10:30am classes because I'm always fricken up this late!
2013-02-05‎@RADICALisaac I dont even know with YouTube anymore.I havent for the last 3 years. They just continue to kill a site that was once creative.
2013-02-05‎@freakshow180 They made it so it's viewable on any mobile device. Just watch her video, walks you through most of it.I still hate it though.
2013-02-05‎@freakshow180 Well I just watched...ughh iJustines video on it and saw how it works. It's REALLY different.
2013-02-05‎@freakshow180 Not even an option. You have to make it part of your background. It's stupid.
2013-02-05‎@freakshow180 I know. Like I said, they seem to keep slowly releasing partner features to everyone. I mean the banner now is
2013-02-05‎@makemebad35 No more backgrounds. No more ANYTHING. Hate this shit.
2013-02-05‎@makemebad35 There is no hope in getting back the user friendly customizable layouts we used to have. No more colored pallets.
2013-02-05‎@makemebad35 It's HORRID. Everything anymore is just WHITE, WHITE, WHITE, WHITE, and did I mention WHITE?
2013-02-05‎@TheArchfiend The channel stats don't even have fucking commas.
2013-02-05‎@TheArchfiend Everything is a mess. The white makes nothing stand out or pop except the featured video player. Everything is buried.

2013-02-05‎@TheArchfiend I saw it from @freakshow180 first. THIS IS HORRID. All YouTube is anymore is white, white, white, WHITE.
2013-02-05‎@Bigbattle22 I have no faith in YouTube anymore.
2013-02-05‎@freakshow180 Every time I'm on YouTube anymore my eyes are straining from just staring at WHITE. I have to watch videos full screen anymore
2013-02-05‎All YouTube is anymore is WHITE, WHITE, WHITE, WHITE. Nothing sticks out or pops. Just the featured video. God only knows the next change.
2013-02-05‎No more custom backgrounds, custom colored pallets, custom margin layout. Everything is buried in the layout and not in plain sight.
2013-02-05‎"I thought Cosmic Panda was a bad change, THIS isn't even a ""CHANNEL"". There is no hope in getting anything like the older channels back."

2013-02-04‎Patriots (39), Steelers (40), Colts (41), Giants (42), Steelers (43), Saints (44), Giants (46), and now Ravens (47). Hmm...  ;D
2013-02-04‎The Ravens are the 8th team in the last 9 seasons to win the Super Bowl wearing white (Packers wore Green in SB XLV).
2013-02-04‎Idk about you but I can def. say the team wearing white is going to probably win the Super Bowl.
2013-02-04‎@TheArchfiend yeah. And especially NO INTs. Craziness.
2013-02-04‎@TheArchfiend I still standby what I said saying I can't picture Flacco with a ring. Still seems crazy.
2013-02-04‎RT @makemebad35: So yeah, way to go Ravens! Looked scary as the 49ers were scratching to the top but you came out in the end. Great win!
2013-02-04‎This is just another punch to the gut for Browns fans. They leave town, win 2 Super Bowls in 12 years.
2013-02-04‎That concludes my Super Bowl tweets for this year. You're welcome for flooding your feeds ;)
2013-02-04‎A storybook end for Ray Lewis as well.

2013-02-04‎Alright down to Baltimore D! Let's go! #Ravens
2013-02-04‎I give SF a lot of credit for staying in this and fighting back. 28-6 made it look like this was a blowout. Hope the Ravens win though.

2013-02-02‎So they didn't need editing.
2013-02-02‎Strange going back to editing after not doing a video in a month. Even if it is a Sleep Talk video.Remember I did Slender videos for a week.
2013-02-02‎Feels like I haven't edited a video in a month..oh wait..
2013-02-02‎@twwc960 it feels loads better but I can never style it right for the first week and a half. Headphones very true.

2013-02-01‎@Ricketts4644 ah that makes sense.

2013-02-01‎@makemebad35 As for your video views I still blame the recent layout changes
2013-02-01‎@makemebad35 I don't know I guess they're trying to clean out dead video views now too I have no idea.
2013-02-01‎@makemebad35 YouTube removed a million views from my total view count last week. a MILLION.
2013-02-01‎A lot more cussing and silly stuff in this one.
2013-02-01‎New Sleep Talk video coming out tomorrow. Been since September since I made one. These recordings are clearer now that I use the iPhone.
2013-02-01‎Again, I lost a MILLION views from the changes they're making. I saw Shane Dawson lost a million on one of his videos. Wtf is going on?!

2013-01-29‎This is something I've been uneasy on for a long time since I deleted an NFL music video that had over 200k views at one time back in 2008.
2013-01-29‎YouTube fixed something I never thought that they ever would, total views. I originally had over a million, now down to 400k.

2013-01-28‎@CyberAceTV I know. Times are changing.

2013-01-28‎You really want me to upload to an online converter and lose a tad bit of quality don't you? Grr...
2013-01-28‎I love you iTunes but WHY must you not show album art when songs are .aiff?! It just has to be mp3 doesn't it?
2013-01-27‎@markiplier When are you attempting Slender Carnival again?
2013-01-27‎Wow I have NOT been using my 2nd channel that much lately. My vlogs are lackinggg!
2013-01-27‎I honestly can't tell you one time where I've sat and watched an entire NFL Pro Bowl game.
2013-01-27‎Marc Steene, Wray Burgess, and everyone who worked on the game did a great job. I even donated a few dollars towards their production.

2013-01-20‎@TimKennedyPKR that's one of the very few games I've ever wanted to fricken break. That's the only madden where I throw an INT every pass.

2013-01-19‎I honestly can't believe the amount of people hating on Prank Tour for including Onision. Honestly I don't even like the guy.
2013-01-18‎That ones like fricken impossible. 10 keys plus escape. I have my doubts on this one.
2013-01-18‎The only Slender Shadows map I have yet to beat is Claustrophobia. I've beaten them all (minus the Xmas special). Craziness!
2013-01-18‎I beat one of the toughest Slender games, PRISON - http://t.co/pUFvI0O4
2013-01-18‎@RADICALisaac Amnesia has also been suggested to me.
2013-01-18‎@RADICALisaac Doing skits and such all the time is tiring so doing something simple like a gaming video helps get a video out quicker.
2013-01-18‎@RADICALisaac I don't plan on doing many game videos. Just once in a while. I looked it up once. Maybe one day.
2013-01-18‎The main reason I put them out on my channel is because making a separate channel for games would be pointless. But that is all lol
2013-01-18‎At least they're daily videos for you lol Never did that before.
2013-01-18‎Until last week. So have always wanted to play and screen record them. Be back to regular videos soon.
2013-01-18‎There's 9 Slender Shadows maps plus the original Eight Pages, so lots of Slender videos for a week and a half. But Shadows was only for PC
2013-01-18‎I know a lot of you aren't interested in these Slender videos as I've said, but have no fear, only 5 more to go and I'll be done with them.
2013-01-17‎@makemebad35 And stay safe on the airlines.
2013-01-17‎@makemebad35 Don't forget to write! lol Seriously, hope it pays off for you man! Traveling for videos takes a toll I imagine.
2013-01-17‎@livinginthenorm I havent had many jump scares at all. They're different than the original game.
2013-01-17‎So that leaves Hospice and Claustrophobia which have always kicked my ass. AND the original Slender The Eight Pages. So three videos left.
2013-01-17‎7th Street I might not do because it lags like CRAZY. Even in the new released update it's still really bad.
2013-01-17‎Somehow managed to beat Slender Prison. I am conquering every Slendermans Shadow map! No idea how. I have two left.

2013-01-15‎@mattmemelo I know but it takes hours to get it up. I haven't had time to re-render and upload since my deadlines are daily.
2013-01-15‎If I were to export H.264 it would take hours and hours to upload. So that could be it. But why it darkens like that, I have no idea.
2013-01-15‎I'm really wondering why my footage from ScreenFlow is darker once it's on YouTube. I export in MPEG-4 and it's fine but darkens uploading.
2013-01-15‎@freakshow180 their Facebook doesn't even have over 1k likes yet. And video promoting it got loads of thumbs downs.

2013-01-15‎@cat_swagger they were originally PC only so never played them until now since they finally made Mac versions.
2013-01-15‎@cat_swagger Carnival, Prison, Elementary, Sanatorium, Mansion, etc are Slendermans Shadow series not by the guy who did the original.
2013-01-15‎@cat_swagger Slender Carnival? Any Slender game is possible. The original Slender Prison is insane though. Never played that version.

2013-01-10‎@freakshow180 You've seen the first? First season is better but I still loved this year's. So many twists like last year as well.
2013-01-10‎The last time I fucked up that much for a video honestly must've been the Whale Xmas from last year.
2013-01-10‎In reality 5-8 lines. They're just really in-depth and took me FOREVER to nail. Two hours for that little script is insane.

2013-01-08‎@markiplier Did you see Marc Steene is asking for money for the new Slender Shadows maps?
2013-01-08‎Stating in the final week before release that it's going to cost money is very short notice.
2013-01-08‎On a project that was someone elses big idea is ridiculous.I know games cost a shitload to make but the fact these were free made them great
2013-01-08‎I mean...$7 isn't much but ripping off Agent Parsec's dominating game to have your own little series is one thing, but asking for money
2013-01-08‎Wow,the owner of the Slender Shadows series is asking for money now to download the mac versions &amp; newest Carnival map?You said it was free!
2013-01-08‎Got academic honors on the deans list from last semester, woo! You have no idea how good of news that is, struggling last year.
2013-01-08‎@JeremyTroyStair now that is fucked up!
2013-01-08‎@TheStupidWizard damn, man! No idea how you do that. I think 6 hours is bad.
2013-01-08‎Holy hell why am I still upp???!
2013-01-08‎@SlendysShadow Any updates on when the maps will be out for Mac? I know you said when Carnival is out. Eager to play!
2013-01-07‎@Ninja_somewhere Because you probably know from my bloopers that I fuck up a LOT.

2013-01-04‎@freakshow180 I've always said twenty ten. So now what, is it going to be the 50s, 60s, 70s, 80s, 90s again or the twenty sixties?!
2013-01-04‎Ohh is my sleep schedule messed up. When college starts back up I'm screwed.

2012-12-31‎RT @DanWetzel: Really strong column on Romo http://t.co/N2tEXhYO by @LesCarpenter
2012-12-31‎@Ninja_somewhere very true lol
2012-12-31‎@churchy281 but if I'm down in the 4th quarter with a 2 minute offense, I'll take Romo any day, just not in an elimination game in December.
2012-12-31‎@churchy281 He's a great quarterback, just not when in elimination games. He chokes in big games.
2012-12-31‎Changes need to be made. Proud of them for fighting the last few games &amp; not giving up. But losing in the last game hurts #CowboysNation
2012-12-31‎Now if you'll excuse me, I'm going to go take my rage out on COD. Good day sir.
2012-12-31‎Fuck the Redskins. Fuck 'em.

2012-12-28‎@cinemassacre change can be good, interested in seeing it.
2012-12-28‎@JWO92911 Better safe than sorry!
2012-12-28‎@Ninja_somewhere Was unsure on the size since those games are huge.
2012-12-28‎@Ninja_somewhere Ah really? I didn't put any games on my mac yet besides Slender. Was looking into the Sims earlier in the year but
2012-12-28‎@Booondock I go back the 14th. I'm in no hurry  =P
2012-12-28‎@livinginthenorm It'll help me do a gaming video now and then which will be nice.
2012-12-28‎Finally can screen record.
2012-12-28‎Also finally bought Screen Flow for Mac. Just in time for Slender: The Arrival! Not sure when they're releasing that but
2012-12-28‎Last year I bought a 16 GB flash drive and it wouldn't work after a few months. Bologna!
2012-12-28‎Got a TB external hard drive for Xmas. Could fit everything I have on my Mac onto that fucker. Through putting stuff on 8 GB flash drives.
2012-12-28‎@makemebad35 A guy I work with said it's like Skyrim with guns. Never played Skyrim though.

2012-12-26‎@livinginthenorm same to you, and sorry about the late reply ;D
2012-12-26‎Funny watching my mom play Space Invaders on the Atari since she played it when she was little. I love the Atari.
2012-12-26‎@kungfualice sick for Christmas rots! Get well!
2012-12-26‎Got a new Atari 2600 model for Xmas. Has around 50+ games on it. Neat to see the early stages of video games. http://t.co/DVn0yPcr
2012-12-26‎@JigsawdeadPage cool to see the early stages of video games with pixelated objects barely representing what they're supposed to be.
2012-12-26‎@JigsawdeadPage I never knew they made them. They're these mini models of the 2600 and was only about $50.
2012-12-26‎@JigsawdeadPage some DVDs, American Eagle stuff, Atari console which is cool. And other things.
2012-12-25‎Here's my Christmas video if you haven't seen the little Jack Nicholson in me yet! - http://t.co/ajGCcynV

2012-12-25‎@freakshow180 really taking a new direction so don't want a lot of the older ones associated with the newer ones.
2012-12-25‎@freakshow180 ah I shouldn't be talking. I've privatized quite a few older videos lately. Especially a few Horse Head ones.
2012-12-25‎@TXBrad hope you're having a great one :D
2012-12-25‎Anyone get anything cool for Xmas?
2012-12-25‎@freakshow180 why private them?

2012-12-24‎It still amazes me how many people shop the day before Xmas, Thanksgiving, etc. Shop in advanceee!

2012-12-23‎@mattmemelo definitely. I they said no less than $20.
2012-12-23‎Come on Cowboys! Beat them Saints! #CowboysNation
2012-12-23‎@MinnesotaBurns dude when I wrap it looks like Homer Simpson did it.
2012-12-23‎@freakshow180 you should do music videos of your tracks. Like just a picture with the music playing.
2012-12-23‎@NintendoSawce hahaha yeah it could.
2012-12-23‎@MrsanprodHD2 Never been better.

2012-12-20‎I had 4 hours to come up with something to film yesterday or chances were, I wasn't going to get a video filmed in time for Xmas.
2012-12-20‎This Christmas video, I'll go out on a limb and say is both funny yet..frightening lol Starts out funny but takes a suspenseful turn.
2012-12-20‎@livinginthenorm Still can't kneel on it fully but it's getting there.

2012-12-18‎Looks like there will be an Xmas video. I just got an idea now that's a tad different than what I was planning on doing.
2012-12-18‎"Which morphed into a field where smosh was just running going ""Wahhh!"" as if they ate something really spicy. I just..don't even know.."
2012-12-18‎Why the fuck did I dream of a friend of mine turning cannibal on me, saying my blood is like wine and my leg like meat?! That is FUCKED.

2012-12-17‎@dpnh technically nearly had both since it gave a me a fever for two days. Shivered for what seemed like forever that night.
2012-12-17‎@dpnh It took six days until it swelled overnight. So been dealing with it for 3 weeks now.
2012-12-17‎@dpnh Kneeling on the hard store floor for an hour scrubbing the bottom shelves for every aisle. Tiny piece of skin came off and infected.
2012-12-17‎@dpnh and protrudes out still. These pills better be magical  =P
2012-12-17‎@dpnh Yeah it's been a week and a half since it swelled up so really am getting tired of it. The swelling pretty much gone, just hurts
2012-12-17‎@livinginthenorm It finally seems on its way out. Got more meds to hopefully rid of it.
2012-12-17‎Major changes coming to my channel in 2013 - https://t.co/UMzQzo8J
2012-12-17‎So they're giving me another prescription for my knee since it's STILL not fully healed. Been a week and a half since it swelled up.
2012-12-17‎@mariolunaone headed back to the doctors today since its not healed yet.
2012-12-17‎@TimKennedyPKR hahaha that sucks
2012-12-17‎@DeMarcusWare You guys made me nervous at the end there. Way to step it up when it mattered and stay in the NFC East race!
2012-12-17‎@dpnh And here people are bitching that it interrupted their football game and Survivor. Good....lord...
2012-12-17‎Just really hoping the Ravens knock off the Giants next week. Redskins have the Eagles which I'm not too confident in. All in all, go 'Boys!
2012-12-17‎This is going to be a nerve-racking final two weeks of the season. Dallas has the Saints and then the Skins. Biting my nails here.
2012-12-17‎@cinemassacre Do you have a favorite NFL team James?
2012-12-17‎RT @EmmittSmith22: How bout them Cowboys

2012-12-16‎@IsaacHarby other than that, Dallas just racking up yards on offense.
2012-12-16‎@IsaacHarby Cowboys up 17-10 in the third. So close to bringing Ben down.
2012-12-16‎Thank you Atlanta for pummeling the Giants today! Cowboys better step it thr hell up vs. PIT today! Do or die!
2012-12-16‎@89Kris Keeps saying it's down on http://t.co/r9ZRK7dx. No idea what's going on with it.

2012-12-15‎A video will be out in the coming days on this.
2012-12-15‎And will not be THAT bad. Experimenting is key to figuring out your routes and paths to success on YouTube.
2012-12-15‎I don't want to be remembered on YouTube for being someone who spoofs and parodies two YouTubers their entire career. The change is coming.
2012-12-15‎The all-out crazy ones you know me for now, will dissipate to occasional videos, rather than each upload.
2012-12-15‎One might be a documentary type approach. It's all up in the air. I'm going to experiment with different genres and styles in 2013.
2012-12-15‎As I tweeted last week, the style of video is going to drastically change each video I put out.One may be serious/dark, one might be comedic
2012-12-15‎In 2013, there will be big changes coming to my YouTube channel. Some you may like, others you might not like.
2012-12-15‎Crazy to think only 16 days until the new year! However, with a new year there's changes.
2012-12-15‎@makemebad35 ohh YOUU bastard. Enjoy that warm weather!

2012-12-14‎@makemebad35 Everyone struggles from time to time. Don't feel you HAVE to get a video out every week. That's tough to do.
2012-12-14‎@makemebad35 As I said on your Facebook post, it's all part of video-making.Public videos are very difficult and you've done great with them

2012-12-13‎"@makemebad35 The biggest issue though is that What To Watch box and not having ""Browse Videos"" there. Doesn't really matter who you are"
2012-12-13‎@JigsawdeadPage It's pretty much the same as a YouTube partner, just getting revenue from another source through YouTube.
2012-12-13‎Took me 4 and 1/2 years but finally partnered with a network on YouTube besides Google Adsense.
2012-12-13‎@FNC Ohohohoo that hurts! (Subscribers are pointless)
2012-12-13‎@makemebad35 Under the channel dropdown on the homepage would show you all of the videos and more, there wouldn't be a huge drop in views.

2012-12-12‎12/12/12 a once in a lifetime experience.
2012-12-12‎I had to waddle to my final exam today lol had it nearly a week now (Thursday) so really sucks.
2012-12-12‎Really wanting this knee infection to fuck right ahff! It's about 85% gone but still hurts like hell.
2012-12-12‎Dearrr mee..when I get going writing scripts I am truly amazed at how I can take a simple rhyme and make it dirty for your viewing pleasure.
2012-12-12‎Scripting the Christmas video now. Loads different than my previous ones. This one is narration rhymed lol My heads gonna kill me when done.
2012-12-11‎RT @makemebad35: It would've been Wes's birthday today. He would be 49. Man, really miss you Wes. Miss you so much.
2012-12-11‎Got it screen recorded. Tried going back to the starting point but fence was still there. Wonder what would happen if I had gotten 8.
2012-12-11‎Was able to go get the 6th page and still no music. And after about 5 minutes of walking around looking behind me he spawned again.
2012-12-11‎over time with the page 5-6 and then page 7 music since I was taking so long to move. And then suddenly it stopped. Walked outside and was
2012-12-11‎Had a crazy glitch happen in Slender (The 8 Pages). I just stood in the bathroom hallway for about 15 minutes. The music kept advancing
2012-12-11‎Well the semester is finally over. Crazy how fast this one flew!
2012-12-11‎But the swelling has moved downward and is slowly, slowly disappearing. Still on antibiotics but signs are looking up! Today wasn't too bad.
2012-12-11‎As for my infected knee...it's getting there. It still hurts a lot and doubt I'll be able to kneel on it for another week.
2012-12-11‎One final exam tomorrow and the semester is historyyy! Can't come soon enough being it will hopefully be my last general studies class.
2012-12-10‎Each video will be a different variety/genre than the previous.
2012-12-10‎I know a lot of you won't mind this change. So ie, two Frog/Whale videos, two yelling videos, etc won't go back to back.
2012-12-10‎Going to be putting out different varieties when I get the chance to film, edit, and upload. No two videos will be back to back genres.
2012-12-10‎My videos are going to be changing for the future. In the mix will be videos like I just put recently, my normal stuff, and more.

2012-12-10‎Uploading a video I wanted out last week before infection took over my body. Should be up soon.

2012-12-10‎@kiersten522 It'll fly over your head before you know it. I've already been out for a year and 1/2.
2012-12-10‎@IsaacHarby Sadly I wouldn't be surprised. We've won our last four games or so, so we'll see.
2012-12-10‎@makemebad35 I'm not liking the playoff picture anyways if we were to get in. ATL, SEA, CHI, GB, WSH, NYG, SF, that is a mean picture.
2012-12-10‎@makemebad35 Doesnt help that the Giants are going to win either. We need a lot of luck to beat PIT, NO, and WSH.Pretty much need to win out
2012-12-09‎We got the Steelers, Saints, and then finish at the Redskins. Good lord...
2012-12-09‎Damn you Seattle, damn youu! 48-0 over Arizona??! Need a lot of luck for my Cowboys to make the postseason.Pretty much need to win division

2012-12-09‎Come on Cowboys, get it together!
2012-12-09‎@makemebad35 tell them about the NES. I had that as a kid. Now THAT is old. GameCube is only 8 years old or something right?

2012-12-08‎Still swelled up but not nearly as painful. Just hoping the swelling starts to dissipate.
2012-12-08‎Well I'm alive. Wasn't as bad as a night as compared to Thursday. Last night I was warm instead of shivering. So the antibiotics are working
2012-12-08‎Thanks for those who watched. Helped lift my spirits a little having that infection.

2012-12-07‎My thoughts on the new YouTube layout- http://t.co/V7X90o9J
2012-12-07‎I shivered like hell last night and today I felt fine but having an undercover fever like that is scary. I barely notice anything.
2012-12-07‎Infections like that are scary. After getting a cut on my knee TWO WEEKS ago, it swelled up yesterday with infection.
2012-12-07‎Whats also strange is I actually have a 101 degree fever but didn't even notice untill they took my temperature at the doctors office.
2012-12-07‎I have an infected bursitis in my knee. Greeaatt...
2012-12-07‎Going to the doctors soon.
2012-12-07‎I didn't do ANYTHING, it just happened overnight the other night. Just got an infection out of nowhere.
2012-12-07‎Sooo my right knee is about twice the size as my left right now. This... Is fucked upp!
2012-12-07‎Mr. Randy is dowwwnnn and ouuut.

2012-12-07‎@freakshow180 Trying to see what I can take without going to the doctor..

2012-12-07‎@TheArchfiend Why they removed the browse videos section I'll never understand it...
2012-12-07‎@J1mmyist That long long? Holy shit..
2012-12-07‎"@J1mmyist Not sure if you mean the layout where ""what to watch"" is default rather than subscriptions.The video page layout is different too."
2012-12-07‎@JigsawdeadPage It's called the wayback machine.
2012-12-07‎@MinnesotaBurns What to watch is the default tab instead of who you're subscribed to...So in a nutshell...9000
2012-12-07‎@YTCreators I can't stress enough how messed up that is not seeing what you're subscribed to as you go to the homepage.
2012-12-07‎@YTCreators What would really help is having the uploaded videos from your subscriptions as the default home tab instead of what to watch.
2012-12-06‎RT @JigsawdeadPage: YouTube, why you always have to be such a dick?
2012-12-06‎Annnnd the video page is different too *claps* *claps* What a shit change YouTube.
2012-12-06‎I've said it a million times in the past..and I'll say it once more..THE YOUTUBE HOMEPAGE LAYOUT IS FUCKING HORRIBLE!
2012-12-06‎"The ""YouTube"" homepage that is."
2012-12-06‎I know a good bit of people had it for a week now or so (what to watch layout). I just got it.
2012-12-06‎@JigsawdeadPage Was a glitch and I was back to the newer layout again. I still dont have the What To Watch one yet.
2012-12-06‎@JigsawdeadPage I had the newer layout a month back and flipped on it (pissed off) and it somehow switched back to the older one but it
2012-12-06‎@ThatOneNugget Not even the smallest tree diminishes Christmas spirit  ;D
2012-12-06‎"@makemebad35 It's just ""Ohh YouTube took away another vital thing from their website away.."" I don't care anymore.."
2012-12-06‎@makemebad35 Not much difference between the two I don't think. But YouTube, I'm not surprised with anything anymore.
2012-12-06‎@makemebad35 I still don't have the new layout with the what to watch default. I have that white one with everything mishmashed together.

2012-12-05‎@TekCrazy7 Thats similar to what I've had. Didnt change yet for me.
2012-12-05‎@TekCrazy7 But now what to watch is default which I dont have yet.
2012-12-05‎@TekCrazy7 I haven't gotten it yet I guess. I thought people were talking about the all white one that I just got a month ago.
2012-12-05‎@makemebad35 Maybe Pwnage is the reason why? That extra channel probably consumes a lot of time, especially getting vids out weekly on it.
2012-12-05‎@dpnh thanks for the RT lol
2012-12-05‎That could be a new series of videos lol Just flat out rage on something.
2012-12-05‎"So it's not meant to be legit, even though I do stress over trying to be more ""original"" in my videos. That was the point of it."
2012-12-05‎A key thing is to not reply to hate and ignore it.Thats the hidden meaning in that video. Im bringing attention to the matter &amp; losing cool.

2012-11-26‎It's just tricky because the old iTouch recordings compared to the iPhone are astonishing in quality difference. I have only

2012-11-21‎I will however throw out the bloopers/extras from the Furby video. It is LOONNG, so for those who enjoy my bloopers this is for you.

2012-11-19‎@makemebad35 You'll never see ANYONE get featured that's a lower rank like me. It's all about what's most popular to get more views and $$$
2012-11-19‎@makemebad35 Most of it is all garbage with rotten misleading titles and thumbnails which grinds my gears and brings my piss to a boil.
2012-11-19‎@makemebad35 It's all the same shit in most viewed/popular these days; Smosh's million channels, Shane Dawson, RayWJ, fuckin VEVOs, etc
2012-11-19‎@makemebad35 I mean HOW does some of your latest not even have 200k?! YouTube's shooting themselves in the foot with layout changes...

2012-11-16‎@freakshow180 My face seemed to get longer too lol
2012-11-16‎@freakshow180 The 2010 more rapid talking one (2 years on Youtube) and now the one nowadays.
2012-11-16‎@freakshow180 To be technical, there's the '08 higher pitched kid voice I had (and the edited high pitch), the '09 going through puberty one
2012-11-16‎@freakshow180 It was however the end of the older type video era for me. Crazy yes, how we both transitioned like that.
2012-11-16‎@freakshow180 haha Idk when my voice changed dramatically. It just did. There's I'd say at least four times my voice has changed since 2008.
2012-11-16‎But no, I did NOT get copyright infringement notices or flags on the video. I took it down for caution in itself.
2012-11-16‎Your youtube videos. I've constantly had to remove older videos with problems such as this. But nonetheless, that is that lol
2012-11-16‎So that's a little memory of the past gone. Wasn't the greatest collab I've done with someone but shows you, be sure you own everything in
2012-11-16‎It was the farthest my current videos go back (September 21, 2009). But nowadays I make sure I have rights to use the stuff I do in my vids.
2012-11-16‎To infringe.But after three years and the views near 30k,I figured one of the bands would claim rights so decided to rough it and delete it.
2012-11-16‎I had two well-known band songs in the video and didn't want to continue the risk of copyrights. That's something I take precious care not
2012-11-16‎Well something I've gotten away with for three years finally made me delete a video, the original makemebad35 Q&amp;A vid.

2012-11-14‎@IamBoobie_miles That's one I never play but true. They're missing a few. I just can't stand Core. Takes too many hits to kill people.
2012-11-14‎@CyberAceTV Should be able to now. I wasn't following you for some reason.
2012-11-14‎Plus the fact there's no ricochet, so every few games I kill my own teammates. It sucks lol There's no real way to tell if it was your team.
2012-11-14‎Gotta give it time though. Just shocked at how good people are at it already.
2012-11-14‎for Black Ops 2. MW3 never had that but Black Ops does. Thats taking me a WHILE to get used to. And there's no HC Kill Confirmed.
2012-11-14‎They both have advantages and disadvantages. But so far I'm leaning towards MW3. The one thing that drives me crazy in on HC the respawn
2012-11-14‎It's been two days and boy do I flat out suck at shooting far on Black Ops II. Not sure which I'm liking more so far; BO2 or MW3.

2012-11-14‎Except ScreenFlow and Camtasia which I've already used. Just not willing to pay $99 for ScreenFlow just yet.
2012-11-14‎Finally got a decent recording of beating the game. Screen recorders are a bitch because all of the big ones with trials have watermarks

2012-11-14‎@_Michael_Myers ahhh! Hahaha
2012-11-14‎@livinginthenorm it's not being scared its wanting to beat it.

2012-11-14‎Save the nightmare for last, thank you brain. I rarely get them.
2012-11-14‎Still can't believe SMP Films is leaving YouTube. That is a huge loss. 7 years is a lot for video making on a social network.

2012-11-09‎@freakshow180 So was just able to render the screen tests video. So just deleted that. Once I get the rest of the bloopers/extras edited
2012-11-09‎@freakshow180 I have so much Furby footage it's insane. I got over 5 hours of the video footage itself, and about 15 minutes of screen tests
2012-11-09‎@freakshow180 I know AVGN has lots of hard drives.
2012-11-09‎@freakshow180 yeah since my Furby footage over 5 hours long PLUS I have all of Damian's Alligator/Horse Head 1&amp;2 raw footage, that's HUGE.
2012-11-08‎@cat_swagger That's awful. I'd go crazy with no sun!
2012-11-08‎Wow, 1 TB external hard drives are actually around $99, I'm speechless lol The Furby stuff filled up everything.

2012-11-07‎@freakshow180 Boooo, it's so close!
2012-11-07‎To stray away from the election for a bit...here's a funny picture of a bird - http://t.co/I780208b
2012-11-07‎RT @freakshow180: Remember when Donald Trump almost ran for president? That was weird...
2012-11-07‎@SuperEd86 Ummm.....
2012-11-06‎@makemebad35 @kungfualice glad you're having fun! Lucky to be in warm weather. Fuckin 35 here.
2012-11-06‎@makemebad35 @kungfualice yay you're alive lol how long you away for?
2012-11-06‎@yosoyian don't say or it won't come true ;P
2012-11-06‎And I was VOTER #666...that's good to know...
2012-11-06‎@jfra yeah probably will be a while being it's neck and neck.
2012-11-06‎Voted for the first time. We'll see what happens in a few hours!
2012-11-06‎I have a feeling this election's going to come down to the wire.
2012-11-06‎Okay I just tried drinking water with the cap on. Wtff??!
2012-11-06‎"@freakshow180 like you would say ""UH-OHHhh"" or ""OH NOOO!"""
2012-11-06‎@freakshow180 lmfao I've seen a few that looked like you from time to time.
2012-11-06‎"RT @freakshow180: Just saw a kid who looked identical to @pioneersprod on my campus. I yelled ""RAAAANNNNNDDDDDYYYYY!"" It wasn't Randy."
2012-11-06‎Voting for the first time tonight.
2012-11-06‎I encourage everyone over 18 today to vote. It might seem silly but every vote matters in changing America #Vote2012
2012-11-06‎Hate waking up to frost. http://t.co/46RIMvXE
2012-11-06‎Woke up to frost this morning, noo!!
2012-11-06‎@dpnh Youtubes never given me issues other than the chat not updating properly.
2012-11-06‎@dpnh to me blogtv lagged badly. So glitchy. Never used that other site.
2012-11-06‎@dpnh But yeah, the G+ Hangouts records straight through which sucks since it will always end up being uploaded.
2012-11-06‎@dpnh No one's going to sit through hours of me talking to text that people can't see. Unlike blogtv where the chat overlays the video.
2012-11-06‎@dpnh It's a 4 hour show so I don't plan to. The first one I did back in September I left up for a few days but I just private them now.
2012-11-06‎Been trying to for 10 minutes but says editing settings aren't available yet.
2012-11-06‎Ignore the video when it shows up in your subscription box. I can't private it just yet for some reason.
2012-11-06‎@RandomShadowMan And then got MAJORLY sick.
2012-11-06‎@RandomShadowMan I've only been drunk once but all I did was laugh...and laugh...
2012-11-06‎Show was fun! Thanks to those who watch for 4 hours. Was crazy!
2012-11-06‎Live on YouTube for a bit - http://t.co/rmK01ZX8  make your Monday less shitty and chat  =)
2012-11-06‎Going live on YouTube for a bit around 8:15 pm ET.
2012-11-06‎Same producer, my bad.
2012-11-05‎One of the best recent horror films I've seen, next to Insidious. Was the same director.
2012-11-05‎Sinister was a fucked up movie but damn was it good!
2012-11-05‎@Ariel_Warren1 okay...that was over a week ago lol
2012-11-05‎@Ariel_Warren1 some what? So confused haha
2012-11-05‎@Ariel_Warren1 wait...the what now??
2012-11-05‎"Anyone see ""Sinister""? Off to see it now."
2012-11-05‎@freakshow180 I'll be done with them after this semester ends.
2012-11-05‎@livinginthenorm Oh, well then your point is valid lol And I have a small gap in between classes.
2012-11-05‎@livinginthenorm Or he's desperate..
2012-11-05‎@freakshow180 So glad I have my last general class now, which is my third science class, which should've been only two. I just want a C.
2012-11-05‎@freakshow180 I never finished the class, dropping it near the deadline. I would've flat-out flatline failed that class.
2012-11-05‎@freakshow180 Who I couldnt understand a damn word that came out of his mouth. He even caused a fuss when people would leave the room.
2012-11-05‎@freakshow180 Damn, well hope you pass that class and never have him again. I've only had one instructor like that, a foreign Bio instructor
2012-11-05‎@smpfilms All of it lol That's insane. Obama must be desperate.
2012-11-05‎@freakshow180 hahaha I forgot about those. I've only done two or so in my college career. That's funny though, I just laughed out loud.
2012-11-05‎@yosoyian I don't mind the Bears. Still haven't forgotten that big loss to them earlier though lol
2012-11-05‎Well this isn't the season I was hoping for..last chance saloon next week at Philly..
2012-11-05‎Congrats Jason Witten, most receptions in Cowboys history! #CowboysNation
2012-11-05‎@The_Dempsey damn straight haha
2012-11-05‎@The_Dempsey come on, don't tell me you've never referred your favorite team(s) as we in situations =P
2012-11-05‎@davedays I would if it didn't shake me up. I buzz.
2012-11-05‎We hit Matt Ryan so hard the hashmark paint is on the front of his helmet lmfao #SNF #CowboysNation
2012-11-05‎@cinemassacre awesome, give a heads up when you expect it to surface  =)
2012-11-05‎Huge game for my Cowboys tonight at Atlanta. Make or break game. #GoBoys
2012-11-05‎@cinemassacre Will the trailer be online eventually?
2012-11-04‎So that could be why. But iPhone records clearer.
2012-11-04‎Idk if the iTouch is more sensible to sounds but I moved the iPhone closer last 2 nights. My recordings are usually me talking softer
2012-11-04‎I usually average one every other night, so to go nearly 2 weeks with nothing but tossing is strange. It's been since I got the iPhone.
2012-11-04‎"I said ""That last duck scene (seen) I just keep getting her...every game"". Yep...makes a whole lot of sense!"
2012-11-04‎So FINALLY after about 2 weeks of nothing I got a strange Sleep Talk recording last night. Probably the longest I've gone.
2012-11-04‎@FNC forgive me but I laughed at this tweet.
2012-11-04‎Because of the hour change. He manually set it back but it reset on its own so he was up right when he should've gotten to work lol
2012-11-04‎"My dad woke up this morning feeling great, showered, turned on the TV and said ""SON OF A BITCH!"". His alarm clock was set wrong"
2012-11-04‎@smpfilms judging by the title...I don't even wanna click that video haha
2012-11-04‎@davedays That movie gets funnier each time you watch it. My dad is obsessed with it lol
2012-11-04‎I think only twice I stayed up to actually WATCH the time switch back &amp; what it would switch to...and that one time was last year.Yyyeahh..
2012-11-04‎Think of how many extra 1 HOURS you waste after you're dead from daylight savings. I guarantee mostly everyone would've used it for sleep.
2012-11-04‎Keep forgetting I have that extra hour tonight so it's really 11:45. OF ALL the things I could be doing I use it for sleep.
2012-11-04‎Everyone remember to set your clocks ahead an hour tonight.
2012-11-03‎I have the latest version so there's no $20 mode. I am satisfied.
2012-11-03‎Well finally did it. Completely beat Slender (Normal, Daytime, Marble Hornets mode).
2012-11-03‎@makemebad35 @kungfualice enjoy the vacation!  :D
2012-11-03‎@makemebad35 @kungfualice youuu lucky ducks. How long you gone for?
2012-11-03‎@kiersten522 lmao what the hell are you feeding it?
2012-11-03‎Why am I still up? I blame Chi Tea.
2012-11-03‎RT @smpfilms: The videos that @YouTube tried to upload on SMP Films today were videos that I removed YEARS ago.  This means, everything  ...
2012-11-03‎@smpfilms that is just crazy..
2012-11-03‎@smpfilms what da eff??! I'd kill to have my old videos back from 4 years ago!
2012-11-03‎@89Kris Damn, I always forget to do FFs. Thanks for including me  =)
2012-11-03‎@smpfilms That's screwed up! Of all the ones I've seen that's definitely something new.
2012-11-03‎Why does Twitter always have an 8 bit shit when I want to change profile pics? EVERY TIME!
2012-11-03‎@TekCrazy7 Really? That's fucked up!
2012-11-02‎@TheArchfiend I blame the new homepage.
2012-11-02‎I can't believe I'll be hearing Christmas music in stores in the coming weeks. Summers already long gone, noooo!
2012-11-01‎@jaelentruong boo this man!
2012-11-01‎My point exactly how EVERY YouTube change is horrendous!
2012-11-01‎Oh..myyy....god....YouTube made ANOTHER change. Now all of my videos in the my videos section over 1000 views it just says 1k. Really???!
2012-11-01‎So thank you all for your awesome comments and tremendous feedback. I really do appreciate it. I swear I lived and slept that video.
2012-11-01‎So got a commentary, bloopers, and extras/behind the scenes stuff coming out for that video. As I said, so much work went into it.
2012-11-01‎"Got a few behind the scenes video for ""A Furby's Calling"" coming out in the coming weeks. College will be limiting me with production"
2012-11-01‎"@makemebad35 So that's why we're seeing so many more channels with ""names"" instead of usernames."
2012-11-01‎@makemebad35 They ask for feedback but instead do the total opposite of what we're complaining about. THAT IS ALL..for now..
2012-11-01‎@makemebad35 I've used it last year and it as more junk/spam/even porn than Facebook. Idk what goes through they're heads in design.
2012-11-01‎"@makemebad35 Your damn channel under an ""Advanced"" box that is near invisible. They REALLY want G+ to get big but I can't see that happening"
2012-11-01‎@makemebad35 I can ramble forever about this stuff. And when you sign up for YouTube, it's a G+ profile now. So you gotta manually create
2012-11-01‎@makemebad35 Theyre incorporating it since Google owns YouTube I guess.But they want your G+profile to be your YouTube profile which is shit
2012-11-01‎"@makemebad35 You'll see in related videos ""TITLE OF VIDEO"" by Michael Buckley, but in reality it's by peron75. See how that fucks up?"
2012-11-01‎@makemebad35 Why it doesnt mix is b/c they encourage now to make your name your username. It's so annoying having those mixed with usernames
2012-11-01‎@makemebad35 *AREN'T organized left to right
2012-11-01‎@makemebad35 The other section is G+ shared stuff. They better change something and soon because that's going to lose users even more views.
2012-11-01‎@makemebad35 So I've had to scroll forever to find video subscriptions that I've missed since it's one stack feed.
2012-11-01‎@makemebad35 By one user. So if they put out more than one it's just single file in no particular order from top to bottom.
2012-11-01‎@makemebad35 One of the most boneheaded moves YouTube's ever made. And plus, the videos are organized left to right for multiple uploads
2012-11-01‎@makemebad35 It's an entire feed in one. So the Liked/Favorited/Commented/any activity sharing mixed with subscriptions.
2012-11-01‎@makemebad35 Here's a pic of mine from when I got switched over - https://t.co/x77GMiqV  There's no subscriptions section ANYWHERE.
2012-11-01‎@makemebad35 In the end, the site will just be white. That's all. They keep changing and removing everything.
2012-11-01‎@makemebad35 well if that's true it doesn't phase me. They change everything that made the site successful.
2012-11-01‎@IsaacHarby Anything it's up to you haha try to do it on something that's hot right now it'll get you more views.
2012-11-01‎Definitely feels like November, brrrr! Only 40s here.
2012-11-01‎@livinginthenorm me exactly. It would take me two months to get a scruff.
2012-11-01‎Just beat Slender Daytime mode as well w00t! Marble Hornets I got 7/8, go figure...Good night!
2012-11-01‎I can die happy nowww!
2012-11-01‎My brother heard me yelling with joy lmao
2012-11-01‎HAPPY FUCKIN HALLOWEEN!
2012-11-01‎YESSSS!!! FINALLY BEAT SLENDER THE EIGHT PAGES! FUCKK YEAHHHH! Got it screen recorded too. OHHH YESS!!!
2012-11-01‎My favorite horror series: Halloween, Friday the 13th, Scream, Child's Play, Insidious, The Shining, Paranormal Activity, annd many more.
2012-11-01‎@smoshanthony thanks, you ruined the word horror for the rest of my life haha
2012-11-01‎@kungfualice that's the coolest kid in class there!
2012-11-01‎@makemebad35 Dude that is fuckin scary haha How the hell could YOU not get a reaction??!
2012-11-01‎@hawk4444 Same to you  =)
2012-11-01‎@MMyers78 Watching Halloween as we speak (1978)  =)
2012-11-01‎Halloween, the night HE came home.
2012-10-31‎SERIOUSLY??! It's always after the rocks heading for the red brick silo thinger. EVERY TIME!
2012-10-31‎7/8 AGAINNN! FUCKK! That's about the 18th time since last night that I got 7/8 and got boned. I..FUCKING...SJFKOFS!!!
2012-10-31‎New video for Halloween if you havent seen it yet! - http://t.co/QfNRipxi  put lots of work into this.
2012-10-31‎I swear...I'm still stuck on 7/8 pages, goddd! (Slender)
2012-10-31‎@TekCrazy7 I've had mine for a few weeks now, lovin it!
2012-10-31‎Badass snapshot from the Halloween video. http://t.co/EIcxIqy3
2012-10-31‎@FNC haha that would be crazy! Def. gotta be a Brendan character.
2012-10-31‎Happy Halloween!
2012-10-31‎I'm going to see that damn Slender map in my sleep.
2012-10-31‎Alright...I'm done for now. About 4 hours playing and I lost on the 8th page about 15 times...I hate you Slenderman..Good NIGHT!
2012-10-31‎RT @IsaacHarby: @PioneersProd I know, but I have faith in you my brother
2012-10-31‎I always get to the rocks on page 7 and the 8th is always the red brick dildo thinger. That's what fucks me up because it's hard to see.
2012-10-31‎@livinginthenorm Nevarrr!
2012-10-31‎@IsaacHarby I can't do $20 mode until I beat the normal mode. I think daytime mode comes after and then $20 mode.
2012-10-31‎I'm going to screen record this one for luck. I have to beat this already, I'm beyond pissed.
2012-10-31‎I've been playing this for about 2 and 1/2 hours now, let me win alreadddyy!
2012-10-31‎heh..guess what...7/8 again...Idk why I'm even still trying..GODDDD!
2012-10-31‎Slender....you're a slender cock..
2012-10-31‎Alright..I'm fucking pissed. About 7 times now in the past few hours I got 7/8 pages. This...shits....SDJHKFIFSHFSLI!!!?!?!!
2012-10-31‎Goddd! 7/8 for about the 5th time, fuckkk youuuu!
2012-10-31‎Again 7/8 FUCKKK! This is  the third time today...I will beat you Slendy...I will DESTROY YOU!
2012-10-31‎@makemebad35 You just got it back now? Damn..Here's my Halloween vid that took a week to do - http://t.co/QfNRipxi
2012-10-31‎Good god, I've been playing Slender for hours now and I still can't beat it. I got to 7/8 pages twice. I was literally 70ft from winning.
2012-10-30‎New video for Halloween for those who have electricity - http://t.co/QfNRipxi  I put a shitload of work into this, enjoy!
2012-10-30‎@makemebad35 came back an hour ago for me.
2012-10-30‎@makemebad35 shocked you're able to tweet. I got one tweet through when I lost power at 10 last night.
2012-10-30‎@livinginthenorm Yeah I just beat the power going out. Took me about 4 hours to upload the damn thing lol
2012-10-30‎RT @FNC: Pretty amazing considering he shot this himself. Love it @PioneersProd http://t.co/wbtGPKro
2012-10-30‎@FNC Thanks Jared, took a lot of work!
2012-10-30‎Power just came back on. Figures, right after I use bottled water to wet my hair.
2012-10-30‎Noooo! The electricity just went out! Effffff!
2012-10-30‎@smosh I'm in Pennsylvania. Still have power, w00t!
2012-10-30‎@makemebad35 If you didn't lose electricity, here's my Halloween video that I put a weeks work into - http://t.co/mIkopm9i
2012-10-30‎It is lengthy yes, but hardly seems that long when watching. This took me an entire week day and night to complete so hope you do like it.
2012-10-30‎"New video for Halloween! ""A Furby's Calling"" - http://t.co/mIkopm9i  Watch with headphones for a chilling experience!"
2012-10-30‎@RandomShadowMan Well I started uploading around 4pm ET and it just finished uploading now. Wasn't going to stop halfway.
2012-10-29‎@makemebad35 that's rotten luck. Stay safe out there!
2012-10-29‎Doing my best to upload now. It's going to take about 3 hours. I might lose power within that time so we'll see what Sandy does...
2012-10-29‎#Sandy has arrived. Stay safe and stay indoors!
2012-10-29‎@mattmemelo Just started raining harder not too long ago. I'm more in higher elevation so I don't need to worry about flooding. Stay safe!
2012-10-29‎@kungfualice stay safe! Just started pouring here.
2012-10-29‎And obviously the fade credit text duration makes the program crash completely. Just can't trust it anymore.
2012-10-29‎I just can't stand iMovie anymore. I've had so many audio issues. I'd split an audio track and it would mute the ENTIRE music track, da heck
2012-10-29‎Wanted this out this evening before the heavy rain starts but not sure if that's going to happen with all of these rendering issues.
2012-10-29‎And now the ending transition throws off the ending audio....I'm going to sit in a corner and SCREEAMMM!!!
2012-10-29‎@markiplier Love the Slender videos.
2012-10-29‎@markiplier I don't know how you manage to put out so many videos, major props to you  =)
2012-10-29‎@FNC Up then I have a big problem.
2012-10-29‎@FNC It's not worth rendering it two more times for one fade in lol I just took it out and started rendering it now. If it's still messed
2012-10-29‎Takes me 2 hours to render the damn video, godddd...Damn you iMovie, damn youuu..
2012-10-29‎WTFF??! It's still out of sync! All I have is a fade in transition from black and it throws of the entire video's audio from start to finish
2012-10-29‎Just depends on the storm. It's gonna take HOURS to upload this. It's 16 minutes long.
2012-10-29‎Shows you, the slightest thing can wreck your video lol Re-rendering now. If everything checks out, I'll either upload today or overnight.
2012-10-29‎Rendered the Halloween video overnight and one transition effect threw off the ENTIRE video's audio from the first line to the end.FUCK YOU!
2012-10-29‎@cinemassacre Damn, James you got mad carving skillz!
2012-10-29‎It looks and feels like a short film. So I put lots of work into this.
2012-10-29‎But when watching it, it hardly seems that long.
2012-10-29‎The video itself is 14 minutes long pretty much, not counting intro/end credits. So 16:30 total. My longest video EVERRR!
2012-10-29‎@RandomShadowMan yeah, in middle school I wanted to be a meteorologist so I always watched the Weather Channel during Hurricane season.
2012-10-29‎@RandomShadowMan Same thing happened when I put out Alligator/Horse Head 2, I lost power the weekend I was supposed to upload.
2012-10-29‎@RandomShadowMan I know, it just had to come for Halloween. The one time I put 10x the effort into something lol We'll see what happens.
2012-10-29‎This video has been so crazy, taking a full week to shoot and complete.
2012-10-29‎I never thought it would happen but FINALLY finished the Halloween video completely. Rest relies on Sandy as to when I'll have it uploaded.
2012-10-28‎That was so close. By a centimeter. This one hurts...
2012-10-28‎Ughhh what a crock of shit that call against the Giants. I swear Dez had that TD.
2012-10-28‎Finally done sifting through footage! All that's left is to add the remaining music tracks. I can't believe I'm finally pretty much done.
2012-10-28‎@makemebad35 That way if you lose power, at least it'll be uploaded.
2012-10-28‎@makemebad35 What you should do for your video is if it's already finished and ready to go, upload it now on a scheduled release.
2012-10-28‎Nearing the end! Random screenshot lol http://t.co/4fhAV5iT
2012-10-28‎@FNC Which why I'm hoping my campus is closed the next two days lol
2012-10-28‎All the while iMovie's been giving me audio glitches again, where it mutes the clip for no reason and crashing when I change fades on text.
2012-10-28‎Just hoping I don't lose power in the coming days from Sandy...that bitch...Stay away!
2012-10-28‎I have been doing work on this video ever since LAST Saturday. Every day except one since then. Been crazy so finally nearing the end.
2012-10-28‎Finally at the ending of the video in editing. Still laying down music tracks but I finally see LIGHT AT THE END OF THE TUNNEL!
2012-10-28‎"I am just realizing how many ""Fucks"" I said in this Halloween video. More than usual haha Every time in a desperate situation, ""Fuck"""
2012-10-28‎Humans, the only species that goes to bed when they aren't tired and wakes up when they are. Screw waking up early!
2012-10-28‎You will def. get spooked watching with headphones, I assure you.
2012-10-28‎Boy are you guys in for a surprise with this Halloween video. I'm spooking myself editing it. I mean it lol If you enjoy demonic sounds.
2012-10-27‎@IsaacHarby I bet haha this is an old 2001 one.
2012-10-27‎@IsaacHarby demonic Furby
2012-10-27‎@IsaacHarby thanks, it's taken so long to make
2012-10-27‎Which normally aren't much longer than 4. Lots of work was put into it and so far it's turning out great. I'm about 8 minutes into it.
2012-10-27‎This year's Halloween video is more like a short film. It's gong to run about 15 minutes long which is bizarre for my videos
2012-10-27‎@cinemassacre Check out the jack-o-lantern my brother made - http://t.co/tTO8xuM2
2012-10-27‎Hoping Sandy doesn't affect my uploading for the Halloween video. Hoping to get it out Tuesday.
2012-10-27‎I had the same issue with Horse Head Lives last year. Was terrified to sleep, AND I'M THE ONE WHO MADE THE VIDEO!
2012-10-27‎Of my shots and then actually walking through there right now thinking he's there. Man I have problems haha
2012-10-27‎But jeez after editing for hours tonight I can't get that scary image out of my head. Just thinking of where I had him in the backgrounds
2012-10-27‎God..I swear that Furby's burned into my retina. I keep thinking it's behind me being how I shot the video lol I made him pretty spooky.
2012-10-27‎@livinginthenorm I have 6 hours of footage for this and shot for about 15 hours for this video. It's been crazy.
2012-10-27‎@livinginthenorm So far it's 5 minutes long and that's only 1/4 of it edited. It's going to be around 15 minutes long.
2012-10-27‎@livinginthenorm It's great so far. It'll take me until Monday to finish editing it. But got some music down on it now and it's good.
2012-10-27‎This is where I was when I found out Ryan Dunn died. http://t.co/wg8ihHvN
2012-10-26‎@livinginthenorm good for you! Keep working at it :D
2012-10-26‎They're in my iTunes. Wtf?
2012-10-26‎iPhone 5 users does your music just randomly vanish? It's the songs I play most they'll disappear and come back randomly.
2012-10-26‎And this is without the Furby sounds in it. I have long way to go yet but nice to have the hard work paying off!
2012-10-26‎It is slower paced so it is going to be a lot longer than my usual videos. I have 5 minutes of it edited so far and I'm speechless.
2012-10-26‎I think this video might be my best video I've ever done. The music just fits and makes it spooky. I went all out in this one.
2012-10-26‎@freakshow180 Ironically the one time I look at a newspaper was today and I saw on the front cover talking about the storm.
2012-10-26‎My normal videos are 2 and 1/2 at most but fucking SIX??! My god..and I'm only 3 minutes into the video out of possibly 15.
2012-10-26‎I have a total of six hours of footage to sift and edit through for the Halloween video..HOLLLYY SHITTTT!
2012-10-26‎@buckhollywood Thanks Buck, you have a great one as well  :D
2012-10-26‎Last year was Horse Head Lives, this year the demonic Furby. Lots to edit for this but should have it out October 30th. http://t.co/RTb2UJqy
2012-10-26‎@FNC Or can't see that it's a fucking phone instead of the Fox News logo  XD
2012-10-26‎@FNC lmao I see how they think FNC is Fox News.
2012-10-26‎RT @TheArchfiend: Today at work someone got out of a taxi and took a shit in front of the building. Guess he couldn't make it indside in ...
2012-10-26‎@TheArchfiend I'm shocked Buck made the Peron75 video centering around you lol

2012-10-26‎After planning this since July, it def. feels good to be done. Editing is another story but thank the looord!
2012-10-26‎I've filmed for about 15 hours total for this. That is INSANE for my videos. Now I got a shitload to edit lol
2012-10-26‎Just finished filming the Halloween video. Holy crap..this is by far the most time I've ever put into filming a video.
2012-10-25‎Time to finish shooting the Halloween video. This my 4th damn night filming this lol
2012-10-25‎@KristinRoseFNC I don't even know if my community college has class ranks. I wouldn't want to see mine lol
2012-10-25‎@cat_swagger So the paper just slipped my mind for some reason haha
2012-10-25‎@cat_swagger I've actually been doing all the work lol It's just me and my brother. I did the laundry, dishwasher, trash, mail, everything.
2012-10-25‎@cat_swagger they just blew out from the box since it was stuffed since Monday lol
2012-10-25‎My parents are away for the week and I forgot about getting the newspaper... http://t.co/SSxY2FYO
2012-10-25‎Got word they just found the guy now.
2012-10-25‎@mattmemelo REALLY?? Damn people are just stupid sometimes...
2012-10-25‎@FNC Every Tuesday/Thursday theres a mandatory hour &amp; a half or so where theres no classes from 11-12:30 or so. So I'm not there right now.
2012-10-25‎Got an emergency text alert from my college. Some 20 year old was seen with a firearm around where my college is.
2012-10-25‎I just spent an hour editing a 37 second intro for the Halloween video...an HOUR..You are not serious..
2012-10-25‎@freakshow180 Whatt??! Why??!
2012-10-25‎@freakshow180 I still can't find the most subscribed list. I've been looking at Social Blade and Vidstats for the past year.
2012-10-25‎@livinginthenorm Sound effects I gotta edit into this and need to be sure it flows smoothly. This is different than any video I've done.
2012-10-25‎@livinginthenorm There's over 100 clips already. So much footage. I hope to have it out the 30th at the latest. There's just so many
2012-10-25‎@livinginthenorm I still have to film the last quarter tomorrow night. I haven't started editing yet which I'm about to start now.
2012-10-25‎I can't sort by uploads. EVERYTHING is mishmashed into one feed. This is awful.
2012-10-25‎I can't stand this layout. And yes I know I bitch about every layout change on YouTube but this may be one of the absolute worst.
2012-10-25‎So now on the new YouTube layout when you like a video, in the activity feed it says You and X others liked this.Who cares how many others?!
2012-10-25‎@smosh It's as if the activity sharing and uploads were thrown into a blender with a blinding light. It's AWFUL!
2012-10-24‎@buckhollywood it's way too messy! Its as if Activity sharing and uploads were thrown into a blender.
2012-10-24‎RT @buckhollywood: @YouTube remember when you use to warn us that the layout was going to change? #Partners
2012-10-24‎"Can I go at least three YouTube videos without ""I grew up in a socialist country...the American dream""?!?"
2012-10-24‎@makemebad35 how...the hell...did you do that??!
2012-10-24‎@hawk4444 alllrightyy thennn! How can you eat soggy cereal??
2012-10-24‎@livinginthenorm as the semester goes on, getting up earlier gets harder for me.
2012-10-24‎@livinginthenorm don't start with me &gt;:P
2012-10-24‎@smpfilms haha my new Halloween video is on Furbies. The 2001, not the 2012 one though.
2012-10-24‎Want it finished already! http://t.co/mCTwEzQL
2012-10-24‎@kungfualice that much. Not a bad artist in my mind though. My moms obsessed with her and Adele.
2012-10-24‎@kungfualice we are never ever getting back together was stuck in my head for a while when that was released. I don't listen to her
2012-10-24‎Ever since the dark days of middle school Ive been doing videos and he thought they were stupid.Little did he know where I'd go with them ;D
2012-10-24‎Lighting for the mood and feel is everything. Nearly finished though!
2012-10-24‎Setting up and lighting has taken twice as long as my normal videos being it's nighttime shooting.So getting the right
2012-10-24‎All that's left to shoot now is the outdoor portions and one other location. Should be able to wrap it up Thursday night.
2012-10-24‎"Ask my brother for help on two shots for the Halloween video ""Hurry up shit ass"", never thought he'd help  XD"
2012-10-23‎I feel like I should sport a shirt and tie more often in my videos. Fun to wear something different. http://t.co/OVx3elnv
2012-10-23‎@makemebad35 Shooting at night also takes its toll. It just flies by and before you know it it's midnight.
2012-10-23‎@makemebad35 Everything has to be well lit, it's just so time consuming but way worth it in the end. Just so much setting up!
2012-10-23‎@makemebad35 Looking forward to yours! Mine's just taking so long to film. Halloween always gets the best of me anymore when I do videos.
2012-10-23‎Ive been shooting so many takes for this it's ridiculous. The other night 4 lines or so was 50 mins of footage.In the homestretch!
2012-10-23‎Editing is going to make this video what it is. That's my main concern. Finishing this up and seeing what it looks like in post.
2012-10-23‎Of blood on my shirt, that's it there's no going back. So I need to shoot in order, which I didn't last year for Horse Head Lives.
2012-10-23‎It's just going to be a messy second half of filming it. That's the biggest reason why I can't shoot out of order. If I have a few drops
2012-10-23‎I got half of it shot. The rest is mostly outdoors so I won't have to worry about being home alone to shoot.
2012-10-23‎Gonna take me at least another two nights to finish this Halloween video. Things always take longer than I expect them to when filming.
2012-10-23‎You know you've been filming for too long when you get in the hot tub in your boxers...
2012-10-22‎Off to shoot more of the Halloween video. Wrapping it up the next two nights.
2012-10-22‎"@TheArchfiend Feedback on his videos (minus the ""gay"" comments). So to see fans outrage like this pleases me for someone doing it for money."
2012-10-22‎@TheArchfiend He's getting loads of hate from his own fans. That's when you know you fucked up. Buck has always been the one with positive
2012-10-22‎@Ashleysykesomg @RandomShadowMan thanks, just stating the truth.
2012-10-22‎For those who follow me and @RandomShadowMan I apologize for the tweet overload
2012-10-22‎@RandomShadowMan You get the point I'm trying to make though? That was a shitload of tweets from me lol
2012-10-22‎@freakshow180 I only know a select few users near the top that don't whore their stuff out.
2012-10-22‎@RandomShadowMan But thats my honest thoughts. Just the way it is these days  =/
2012-10-22‎@RandomShadowMan Stay on top and that nets them money. Money on YouTube just grinds my gears. People on bottom get no recognition.
2012-10-22‎@RandomShadowMan Look at iJustine. She has around 6. SIX PARTNERED CHANNELS. That's ridiculous. They need to do everything they can to
2012-10-22‎@RandomShadowMan That's what people on top do. That's what they rely on, it sucks. That's why they have a million accounts.
2012-10-22‎@freakshow180 That's what I feel too. They sold out. All it is today is everything that's a celebrity, nudity, and such. Fame got to them.
2012-10-22‎@freakshow180 The partnership program ruined everything. That's what it's come to anymore on YouTube, cash.
2012-10-22‎@RandomShadowMan Making people who put time &amp; effort into their videos to make them presentable look bad and keep them out of the spotlight
2012-10-22‎@RandomShadowMan I'm not saying it in a harsh way or anything. It's just too easy to do.
2012-10-22‎@RandomShadowMan of dollars are doing these channels just b/c they can suckering in viewers for cash on videos that require little effort
2012-10-22‎@RandomShadowMan Is just a bonus. It helps out in times like these with college. But top elite partners who make hundreds of thousands
2012-10-22‎@RandomShadowMan I'm just saying, that's what it's come to anymore. I do videos because I love to do them. The partnership program
2012-10-22‎@RandomShadowMan viewers. And they know people will watch because they'll play games that are mega popular to get more hits and obviously $$
2012-10-22‎@RandomShadowMan As well as http://t.co/wRbCGJWO They got more than enough money and they just make gaming channels to cash in on more
2012-10-22‎@RandomShadowMan Look at Smosh. They have at least 6 types of videos and at least 4 other channels besides the new gaming channel.
2012-10-22‎@RandomShadowMan it's a shame. And that's what YouTube is coming to anymore. People on top making gaming channels just because.
2012-10-22‎@RandomShadowMan Top partners are making gaming channels because they can for more revenue just by recording voice overs over gameplay
2012-10-22‎@RandomShadowMan But he's still doing it for the money.
2012-10-22‎A lot longer than my usual videos. So we'll see what happens.
2012-10-22‎It also depends how long it runs. If it's 16 mins or longer, it'll be two parts most likely, because I do know this is going to be
2012-10-22‎I had doubt that I'd get it all done in one night. Hope to have it all edited and out before the 30th. That's the plan, not guarantee.
2012-10-22‎So Monday and Tuesday night I will film the rest of the Halloween video. I got extra time Tuesday now so that helps a SHITLOAD.
2012-10-21‎I AM SO SICK OF TOP ELITE YOUTUBE PARTNERS MAKING GAMING CHANNELS. This is just getting out of hand anymore. (cont) http://t.co/AacXgLBR
2012-10-21‎@TheArchfiend Smosh especially.
2012-10-21‎@TheArchfiend I automatically hate any top YouTuber that creates a gaming channel pretty much. It's just getting ridiculous.
2012-10-21‎That's the way it goes with shooting. Just gotta put in the effort.
2012-10-21‎I'm gonna have to bust my balls to get this done Monday night. I mean BUST. Monday's my only slot.
2012-10-21‎Well after all the setting up and wardrobe and such I only got about 5 lines shot. It's ridiculous how time consuming setting up is.
2012-10-21‎Red Bull is going to be my best friend tonight.
2012-10-21‎@89Kris Certainly =)
2012-10-21‎Summer so really glad I'm finally going to get this shot. can't wait to see the outcome!
2012-10-21‎Going to begin filming my Halloween video tonight and wrap it up Monday night. Been planning to do this one for months now pretty much since
2012-10-21‎@makemebad35 shooting mine Monday night. Best of luck!
2012-10-20‎Sleep well my followers. Watch out for Slender Man in the dark corner of your bedroom!

2012-10-20‎Finally got 7/8 pages on Slender. Been stuck on 6 pages for weeks. The damn fog is what pisses me off most b/c I can't see what's ahead.

2012-10-19‎RT @freakshow180: .@PioneersProd It's true, I remember very well. Those caps would just break in the middle of class at the worst times.
2012-10-19‎@JigsawdeadPage idk, those vids are just getting old to me. I loved the 2011 one but this one just wasn't that funny.
2012-10-19‎Not sure when AVGN started the bullshit series but wasn't long before then.
2012-10-19‎&gt;@freakshow180 can vouch for me on this
2012-10-19‎True fact my first sucks video was actually back in 2008 about how Vitamin Water caps suck. Way before I knew of AVGN.
2012-10-19‎@JigsawdeadPage yes
2012-10-19‎Not that it wasn't good...just seemed lacking something. Idk.
2012-10-19‎That..might have been the worst Food Battle yet..

2012-10-19‎@kungfualice Blood, it's for my Halloween video haha
2012-10-19‎Paints fuckin expensive yo!

2012-10-17‎I've been saying this for YEARS now. Almost three years. I'll always love them but these changes drive me crazy.
2012-10-17‎ALWAYS, as soon as you just get used to the damn layout YouTube changes it again making it even worse than the last.
2012-10-17‎Am I the only one who misses the good old days where you were able to customize your channel layout colors? Yeah I guess @YouTube doesn't.
2012-10-17‎There is so much white, it buurrnnns!

2012-10-17‎I even said something when I woke up at 6am about a dream I had and it didn't even pick that up. Going to dual set up tonight
2012-10-17‎Noticed I've been getting a LOT less recordings on the Sleep Talk App since I got the iPhone. It records a shit load less.
2012-10-17‎@cat_swagger True dat!
2012-10-16‎I'll still edit it, I do NOT want to do that map again haha
2012-10-16‎Web cam didn't even work with the screen recording program so had to use my t2i and it's really dark. Ughh..
2012-10-16‎Why must the newer Slender Shadow maps be for PC only??! The screen recording has the mouse pointer on it, damnnn youuu!
2012-10-16‎Just filmed a new Slender video on one of the newer maps. Failed epically!
2012-10-16‎I've been really trigger happy with Instagram now ever since I got the iPhone. Must...slowww...dowwwnnn!

2012-10-16‎@IsaacHarby Copyrighted music. That's a big reason for deleting a lot of my older videos, either they were REALLY bad or I had music that

2012-10-16‎@IsaacHarby The blast from the past one? Haha it did for me too, it was like opening a gift finding old footage like that  XD
2012-10-16‎I never knew there were more maps for Slender besides the main one everyone knows. EXCEPT they're all for PC which sucks. They look amazing!
2012-10-15‎@thedarksquid Tenth grade is when I really changed (2009). Always fun to look back than to not have the footage at all though  =)
2012-10-15‎@thedarksquid haha I know, I always look back on when I first started YouTube four years ago and can't believe how different I was.
2012-10-15‎Will only be about the 3rd time I've had to film a span of over a few days to a week (Horse Head Lives, Just One Of Those Days)
2012-10-15‎This might run over 12 minutes long too so I really hope it turns out. Monday we launch!
2012-10-15‎This is a tall order. Halloween just crept up on me so fast!
2012-10-15‎This one deals with Furbies. I got Monday-Friday (October 22nd - 26th) to shoot it all and get it edited over the weekend for Halloween.
2012-10-15‎Friday will have been a year since I filmed Mr. Horse Head Lives, boy does time fly anymore. Working on the new Halloween video next week!

2012-10-14‎@HarlsJane the Super Bowl yes, that's the championship.
2012-10-14‎@HarlsJane we haven't done anything all year that's been remotely impressive besides beating the Giants. We're always playing catch up.
2012-10-14‎Season just keeps slowly slipping away.
2012-10-14‎Holy wow with the waste of clock Cowboys, wtff??! Great comeback but horrible finish.
2012-10-14‎Well this Yankee game is crazy. I'm not a huge baseball fan but have been a Yankees fan all my life. 4 runs in the bottom 9, whaatttt??!

2012-10-12‎It's just a repeated picture..I thought I had around 30+ recordings I couldn't hear from last night but in reality there was only 11.
2012-10-12‎Wowww...I am an idiot. The Sleep Talk recorder history preview has the blue sound waves (which I thought were the recordings) but

2012-10-02‎@kungfualice Win, I mean, how many more chances does he get? He just makes too many mistakes. It was back in 2009 when I said I'll give
2012-10-02‎@kungfualice Great when he has to at times and I admit he's stunned me quite a lot, but he still can't win the big one. Only has one playoff
2012-10-02‎"@kungfualice 2006/2007 Romo I loved (not counting the botch in SEA playoff game), but from 2008 on it's been, ""ahh jeez Romo!"" He can be"

2012-10-02‎Lots of rebuilding still to do with my Cowboys it seems..
2012-10-02‎@IsaacHarby Thanks man! I knew when I was editing it was gonna end up crazy lol Didn't expect it to turn out the way it did.
2012-10-02‎@kungfualice But you can't throw 2 INTs for TD's and throw 3 more and win..
2012-10-02‎@kungfualice I know Romo's better than that. But our defense completely fell apart against the pass. Ground game on DEF was great.
2012-10-02‎@kungfualice I'm disgusted by that loss. When you do that poorly in front of your home crowd in Jerry World, you're in deep trouble.

2012-09-12‎The area above where the platform to snap it onto the camera is.I guess since I was spinning the monitor around frequently it came unscrewed
2012-09-12‎SHIT! My monitor just got knocked loose while filming and was all caught on film. Somehow the second lowest portion came unscrewed and fell.

2012-09-12‎@NkotbsbZoe Flips are generally for vlogging.
2012-09-12‎@NkotbsbZoe I wouldn't recommend it for that. The zoom is awful. For a concert I'd recommend that Sony Handycam HD.
2012-09-12‎@NkotbsbZoe That's the one I have and now a hundred dollars less. They aren't the greatest unless you vlog. Quality isn't the best.

2012-09-12‎@mattmemelo It's just X everywhere.

2012-09-12‎@NkotbsbZoe Has the flip out viewfinder and such but you'll have to spend $170-$250.
2012-09-12‎@NkotbsbZoe Sadly you'll have to spend over $100 to get a decent camera. Even the old Flip HDs are $120 or so. I'd recommend a Sony Handycam

2012-09-08‎I apologize for my massive tweets today lol So pissed about that game
2012-09-08‎@makemebad35 Re-downloading them all now, I got work until 9 so praying it works. I haven't seen these maps yet either. So let's hope!
2012-09-08‎@makemebad35 Never knew that was even possible. A fuckin map pack you DLd can prevent you from playing the damn game? lol
2012-09-08‎@makemebad35 PioneersProd has started playing Modern Warfare 3 and then it would freeze there and blink every 4 seconds.
2012-09-08‎@makemebad35 Between my two consoles. Ridiculous. Like what would happen is I'd get to the black screen where you begin and it would say
2012-09-08‎@makemebad35 I had to uninstall the map pack alltoghether and have to re-download it AGAIN this evening. This will be THREE times.
2012-09-08‎@makemebad35 Doesnt make any sense. So I bought a new $60 game for nothing, there was NEVER anything wrong with the damn disc.
2012-09-08‎@makemebad35 yeah I saw on a few Activision forums that the new DLC 4 map packs are causing stuff like that
2012-09-08‎@makemebad35 The game was never broken.
2012-09-08‎Thank you Xbox, no really thank you lmfao
2012-09-08‎THAT'S why I couldn't get past the black screen menu last night. It's the damn map packs that glitched the game. Unbelievable....
2012-09-08‎I'm gonna flip shit. That whole Xbox trouble I had with mw3 was the new DLC 4 map packs I bought.
2012-09-08‎@makemebad35 The disc was never broken. FUUUUCKKKKKKKK! I just spent $60 on a brand new mw3 and the disc was fine all along.

2012-09-08‎@makemebad35 very funny haha yeah it does. Used games are $50 RIDICULOUS. So bought the new disc for $60.
2012-09-08‎@makemebad35 I mean wtfff lol $20 for the maps I couldnt play + broken disc + $30 for a pre used game...THATLL TEACH YA
2012-09-08‎@makemebad35 didnt work. so wasted an hour and 1/2 for nothing. BULLLLSHIIIITTT...
2012-09-08‎@makemebad35 it's too scratched to play and sucks b/c it worked on my bro's xbox. Moved it up to my room redownloaded the maps AGAIN and
2012-09-08‎@makemebad35 yeah I sent you guys lots of messages. I'm at game stop now getting a pre-used one.
2012-09-08‎@makemebad35 Way to rub it in lol what'd I miss?
2012-09-08‎There goes $20 on the new maps and now most likely another $20 to buy a used game, grrr...
2012-09-08‎And yes I did try various techniques cleaning the disc. Its been scratched a bit but worked fine until now. Figures, when the maps come out.
2012-09-08‎Tomorrow to buy a pre-owned disc. Thank you xbox...no really thank you.. X(
2012-09-08‎I sat for an hour and a half waiting for those maps to re-download and this is what I get. Just greattt..looks like I'll be at game stop
2012-09-08‎Re-downloading the maps on THAT xbox and then not having the disc work whereas it did just before you downloaded the maps. WHAT...DA...FUCKK
2012-09-08‎You know what's bullshit? Downloading new mw3 maps and then having a disc read error on your xbox. Having the disc work on your other xbox

2012-09-07‎@NkotbsbZoe Yeah, as long as it isn't something recorded from the tv it's fine. Read the terms of use.
2012-09-07‎New Sleep Talk video will be out this weekend or Monday, keep a look out!
2012-09-07‎@nfl Ohh stupid me..didn't see the link haha Thought you meant perfect in general.
2012-09-07‎"@nfl No such thing as a ""perfect"" QB."
2012-09-07‎@freakshow180 lmfao
2012-09-07‎@NkotbsbZoe hate helps you improve. Unless it's a comment saying you suck, that doesn't really give a valid reason why they didn't like it.
2012-09-07‎@NkotbsbZoe Remember what I said, you can't let hate get to you. Ignore them. It's just a guy hiding behind his words in front of a computer
2012-09-06‎New video! Slender Gameplay Reaction - http://t.co/cmZIKowK
2012-09-06‎Might be a few hours until it's up being it's 10 mins long.

2012-09-06‎@dallascowboys Huge boost for us to defeat the Giants on the road to open the season. This aint the same ol' Cowboys defense!
2012-09-06‎Well what a relief to best the Giants on the road.
2012-09-06‎@TheArchfiend awfully quiet Archie &gt;:D
2012-09-06‎How bout them Cowboys! @kungfualice
2012-09-06‎@SEMPERFIDELIS29 gaming videos aren't my area of expertise
2012-09-06‎@dallascowboys they're doing better defensively. Three points allowed vs Giants is a huge step.
2012-09-06‎@SEMPERFIDELIS29 I don't use one but I always try Amazon.
2012-09-06‎To be honest I'm stunned we held NY to 3 in the first half.

2012-09-05‎@joshuashanevis true lol
2012-09-05‎@makemebad35 What're some of the good players you drafted?
2012-09-05‎@makemebad35 I've been doing fantasy for about 7 years. It's fun if you're in a league with people you know.
2012-09-05‎@MinnesotaBurns the bee trolled youu!
2012-09-05‎@smoshanthony if I had a nickel for ever time you've included RT in your tweets, I'd be a millionaire.
2012-09-05‎Yess! Back to NFL Football tonight! My Cowboys have a tough year ahead of them. A win over NY would be huge.
2012-09-05‎@iFahmi13 lmao in the dream or the game? The game I can only get 4. Dream I was frozen lol
2012-09-05‎Guess who woke up at 5am from a Slender Man nightmare? THIS GUY. I swear when I woke up I saw him lol
2012-09-05‎@SEMPERFIDELIS29 It takes strategy lol That dungeon maze building he scared the shit out of me. Came flying around the corner and DUNNN!
2012-09-05‎@makemebad35 haha yeah I can only get 4 pages though. That dungeon maze building fucks me over every time.
2012-09-05‎@kungfualice lol I've been playing it for over an hour. I can only get 4 pages. That damn dungeon maze building fucks me every time.
2012-09-05‎@makemebad35 Best I got were 4 pages.
2012-09-05‎@makemebad35 That game makes me sweat haha First time I played it I had headphones in and I jumped a foot out of my chair at the first sting
2012-09-05‎The best I got were 4 pages. That game makes me sweat haha
2012-09-05‎@imatu777 Sprinting makes it worse? I sprint to get there faster.
2012-09-05‎@imatu777 haha no, I only get like 3 pages and I get stuck, or my flash light gets too dim. I can never tell where I'm at.
2012-09-05‎My reaction to playing Slender the first time the first sting went off. http://t.co/WrdZza1Y
2012-09-05‎@kungfualice I had headphones in mind you  =P
2012-09-05‎@kungfualice I just played the game now lol I jumped so high when the first sting went off lmao
2012-09-04‎@imatu777 haha wow. And a day before my 20th birthday. Won't film it until the first week of October or so. Need the autumn leaves.
2012-09-04‎RT @imatu777: @PioneersProd http://t.co/ZaiToDvN You should release your Furby vid on 9/16/12 because that's when the new Furbies are co ...
2012-09-04‎@Ricketts4644 Now with that new layout there's no way customize your channel layout with colors. That was the fun part of it being creative!
2012-09-04‎@Ricketts4644 Took me days to realize there was the option. I don't know what YouTube's smoking incorporating G+ as the default for accounts
2012-09-04‎@Ricketts4644 How you sign up for a G+ account and have to manually create a channel in a very hidden section of the settings.
2012-09-04‎@Ricketts4644 When I made my PioneersClassics channel, I couldn't believe how different it is now when new users create accounts.
2012-09-04‎Video filmed, looks like this one will be this years. Really gonna work hard on lighting for this one. Even composed some music myself.
2012-09-04‎I got a lot of setting up to do for this year's so this month I might even be shooting portions of it. The past two years I've had a big
2012-09-04‎when I was a kid. Now it's time to make them scary on the YouTube silver screen  &gt;:D
2012-09-04‎Finally got what will be the structure for my Halloween video this year in the mail today. Furby's scared me a little http://t.co/ZBsw56fT
2012-09-04‎@makemebad35 that was the fun in it, being creative with layouts making your channel pop. Why they took it away I'll never know.
2012-09-04‎@makemebad35 only the background color can be changed its stupid. Can't change the module colors.
2012-09-04‎Ohh Labor Day weekend why you have to end??!

2012-09-03‎@makemebad35 At 3:16 in your Jimmy video my gamertag popped up saying I left the game because I tried to switch teams, that's funny lol
2012-09-03‎The bulk of this hasn't been seen in bloopers. This shows all the setting up and a good bit of mistakes on Damian's end lol
2012-09-03‎Happy 1 year anniversary for Alligator/Horse Head 2, here is a raw footage video - http://t.co/q2fPMzff  full of straight footage.

2012-09-03‎@MirroredTheory still more work to do on it?

2012-09-03‎@RandomShadowMan I should've for fun lol It was bad. Haven't hiccuped that much since high school. That went for 40 mins. This, about 25.
2012-09-03‎"I think I'm done then out of nowere hubuupp! They're not ""hicuppp!"" hiccups, there more like gasping for air hiccups lol"
2012-09-03‎Godddd I have been hiccupping non stop for 20 mins, da fuckkk??!
2012-09-03‎@GermoRumask The live show? I don't do them often, only once a month pretty much. We'll see..
2012-09-03‎@GermoRumask Okay, followed back  =)
2012-09-03‎Thanks to those who watched and chatted at the live show, was fun! Think the different web cam made a huge difference in quality.
2012-09-03‎Live now, watch here - http://t.co/fEZi90pl
2012-09-02‎@imatu777 haha ohhh Ask Pioneers, that's so old. Definitely horror.

2012-09-02‎20 mins long  o_0 but bulk is all raw footage you haven't seen in the bloopers. Just wanna show what goes into shooting a collab like that.
2012-09-02‎I'll just do a revisited video next year or sometime down the road when I run into walls and are unable to film much. This video is
2012-09-02‎It is long as shit but want try to and show how much work was put into it. I only have Damian's footage, deleted mine last year which sucks.
2012-09-02‎Got a whole video full of raw/unedited footage from Alligator/Horse Head 2 coming out tomorrow afternoon for the one year anniversary.
2012-09-02‎@NkotbsbZoe We have Kindergarten, and then first through twelfth. None of that stuff.

2012-09-02‎@freakshow180 You know what I instantly thought of the other day for some reason? That video we watched in the auditorium once where
2012-09-02‎@synthplaya That's not easy to do, hope it works out  =)  Let me know once you get it rolling.
2012-09-02‎Out first since it's the anniversary tomorrow, craziness!
2012-09-02‎I'm probably going to wade it out for one more bizarre recording and make the video. Want to get an Alligator/Horse Head 2 REVISITED video
2012-09-02‎So I have a total of 44 new Sleep Talk recordings for the new video.That's over ten more than the last one. This goes back to June 4th or so
2012-09-02‎@synthplaya stick with that. I only used it once though.
2012-09-02‎@synthplaya I know. I think a big reason is because I'm not on blogtv that much anymore. I tried that new youtube hangouts and might
2012-09-02‎@synthplaya best of luck to you man!
2012-09-02‎@kungfualice lmfao
2012-09-02‎That'll NEVER happen again, EVER. I usually average 23 kills or so. To get 50 twice in a night is ridiculous.
2012-09-02‎I may very well be on @kungfualice and @makemebad35 hitlist after getting 55 kills and 51 kills on HC RIC KC on mw3 tonight. CRAZINESS!

2012-08-31‎Well I finally saw the news article on @nathanwills and the way he committed suicide. Stabbed himself to death my gosh...
2012-08-31‎@TheArchfiend I just realized you never told anyone on YouTube your real name :O
2012-08-31‎@makemebad35 I had just gotten on xbox and invited you and you logged off, damn lol first time I've seen you on in over a week lol
2012-08-31‎The Canon T2i really made that one, one of my best videos.
2012-08-30‎Wont shoot it for another month or so but been looking forward to this one for a while. last year's was Mr. Horse Head Lives.

2012-08-29‎@kungfualice Any word on your nephew? Fever go down?
2012-08-29‎@NkotbsbZoe yeah I saw Ted back in July. One of the best movies I've seen for today's movies. I'm hard to please with comedy lol

2012-08-29‎@imatu777 Please tell me they've already discovered facebook  =X
2012-08-28‎@IsaacHarby I don't know how to notice if it is modded though. Like gameplay would be altered you'd think? Nothing seems out of the ordinary
2012-08-28‎@IsaacHarby away, but glad it isn't tampered with.
2012-08-28‎@IsaacHarby I noticed it takes a little longer for the tray to open/close. But works fine.The faceplate and cables caught my attention right
2012-08-28‎@IsaacHarby Yeah I've never bought a used game console before so took a bit of a risk but I mean it's used so it isn't like brand new.
2012-08-28‎"New 2nd channel video out as well ""Back to the Grind"" - http://t.co/c1g8fgjU"
2012-08-28‎@IsaacHarby The console could be 4 years old for all I know. Stuff breaks over time.
2012-08-28‎@IsaacHarby Yeah but it was pre-owned. Someone could have bought a custom faceplate and cables because something happened to the others.
2012-08-28‎@freakshow180 haha yeah I just saw on Pardon the Interruption that they have pretty much the best record and saw on http://t.co/u1cyNXCR

2012-08-28‎@freakshow180 Okay..I don't follow MLB much but the fuckin Nationals have the best record??! Where are my glasses??
2012-08-28‎As in microsoft sticker I mean the warranty sticker.
2012-08-28‎that means it was tampered with but mine is still firmly attached so I guess it's not modded after all. That would've sucked.
2012-08-28‎Okay just did some research and on Ehow they said if you pull the faceplate off and the microsoft sticker is missing or ripped
2012-08-28‎Game play or anything. That would fricken suck though if it is modded. I'll have to do some research....
2012-08-28‎I hooked those up to my brothers Xbox and used the standard red/white/yellow that came with our original xbox. Never noticed a difference in
2012-08-28‎These are the RCAs that came with it as well. That's what caught my eye at first at being suspicious. I didn't use those cables though.

2012-08-27‎Not too much fun you can make out of cables behind your TV lol
2012-08-27‎It is a good video but is lighter on the comedic side. This one is more about something that is just stressing Hard to make jokes in it.
2012-08-27‎Should have the new Sucks video finished edited this evening.
2012-08-27‎@FNC Ahhh I want!
2012-08-27‎@NkotbsbZoe Thanks, wasn't bad at all.

2012-08-24‎@freakshow180 Thanks. He was my great uncle. I didn't know him too well or saw him often. Still hurts though.
2012-08-24‎Crazy to think I'll be 20 on the 17th next month though. Hard to believe I'm in the final month of my teens.
2012-08-24‎Is strange how you run into people who you did things with over 10 years ago and they ask to grab a drink with you...if only I were 21 lol
2012-08-24‎Well with this event that happened I havent gotten to edit the Sucks video. I wanted it out tomorrow but we'll shoot for Saturday then.
2012-08-23‎Going to a viewing. That is just so eerie...

2012-08-17‎There are scene selections in the description.
2012-08-17‎Fatass: The Movie - http://t.co/EoHbrcqo   Here it is. Filmed all of this from April through July. If you like Jackass, you will def like it
2012-08-17‎@nnaatteeks And my brother actually had all the ideas and edited the movie. I just added in transitions. It's looks great though.
2012-08-17‎@nnaatteeks So is like one last hurah. Who knows, maybe we'll make another next year.
2012-08-17‎@nnaatteeks I'd love to make another one, but only reason we made a movie out of it is because our friends are going away to college.
2012-08-17‎@nnaatteeks portions (I'll have scene selections in the description) are in April so we're in jackets/hoodies. And then we're in summer lol
2012-08-17‎@nnaatteeks It was lots of fun making it. Only thing is it spanned all summer. We didn't do it all in one sitting. You'll see, the first
2012-08-17‎@freakshow180 If a higher user did, then the likes would be over 100 by now. Doesn't make sense.
2012-08-17‎@nnaatteeks We cut out some public portions with liquid ass since nothing really happened. So sucks a little didn't make it.
2012-08-17‎@nnaatteeks and the stunts are 10x as dangerous for some. So you will def. like it.
2012-08-17‎@nnaatteeks and being we're 4 years older, we can drive and go places we couldn't before in public. There's two public portions I believe.
2012-08-17‎@nnaatteeks I finally got a chance to watch the whole thing and it is pretty awesome compared to our original videos.
2012-08-17‎@nnaatteeks Yeah, I'm going to try and overnight it. That should work being I won't be on the internet possibly interrupting it.
2012-08-17‎Eight comments isn't a lot at all, but for a year old video in one day, that's crazy for my channel.
2012-08-17‎"Wtf, my ""Dog Hates The Word PAW"" video is blowing up with comments today, what's going on herezzz?"
2012-08-17‎@RandomShadowMan I'm always glad I don't have to deal with the drama.
2012-08-17‎@RandomShadowMan I, to be honest, just don't care that I don't have a gf. Yes I'm straight lol but idk why, I just don't care right now.
2012-08-17‎@RandomShadowMan and happy early birthdayyy! I'll be 20 in a month. I can't believe it.
2012-08-17‎@RandomShadowMan I changed a LOT in the past 4 years
2012-08-17‎@makemebad35 to it by pure random. He's not even on my friends list. So crazy for that to happen lol
2012-08-17‎@makemebad35 Craziest thing just happened. Remember that Egypt guy we used to play mw3 with? I was just in a random match he was connected
2012-08-17‎Fuckkkk, it froze halfway through the upload. Just greattt. I'll have to try overnight then. Thank youu YouTubeee!
2012-08-17‎Video is at 40% now. Says 150 mins left. Will be up at - http://t.co/wiivH3yk
2012-08-17‎@RandomShadowMan Said would take a little over 200 mins. At 153 now. God, takes forever.
2012-08-16‎And I think I finally done it. Hopefully will be up in a few hours.
2012-08-16‎Never in my life have I had to upload a 20+ min video to YouTube. This is so stressful trying to get it compressed so it can upload.
2012-08-16‎It definitely has the Jackass feel to it. Just waiting for the compression to finish to see if it helped.
2012-08-16‎The Fatass Movie turned out great. I'm just trying to get it compressed and uploaded ASAP. Won't be in a week after all.
2012-08-16‎If I just upload it, it says over 500 mins remaining and counting up to upload? I don't want a lot of quality drain.

2012-08-06‎The video was cheesily edited but still hard to believe the positive feedback I've gotten on it for 2 years.
2012-08-06‎Hard to believe it's already been 2 years since Mr. Horse Head Meets Mr. Wooden Alligator was put out. Over 1000 likes is crazinessss!
2012-08-06‎Am I the only one who thinks the new Nike uniforms (NFL) are worse than the Reebok ones? Or whoever owned them before this year?
2012-08-06‎Holllly CROW!!! http://t.co/0yEcXr4k
2012-08-05‎@NkotbsbZoe thanks, glad you enjoy them!
2012-08-04‎@freakshow180 I think at the end I died.
2012-08-04‎@freakshow180 Yeah, I don't remember much either, just that I was checking my messages and freaking out over them.
2012-08-04‎@freakshow180 But I still have a printout of my channel back in 2009 and from that day, I had gotten up to over 200 spam messages.
2012-08-04‎@freakshow180 screen recorded it and stuck it in the video. I don't have them anymore though, they're lost in cyberspace forever sadly.
2012-08-04‎@freakshow180 kept coming back after I'd block him and he actually answered it and he was recording on blogtv so later I went back and
2012-08-04‎@freakshow180 yes, had two parts. Remember Michael Buckley was in it? I posted on his live forum that there was an annoying youtuber that
2012-08-04‎5 downloads already on the medley? Awesome, thanks!
2012-08-04‎"@imatu777 lol eventually. I plan on some ""Revisited"" videos soon, like Alligator/Horse Head 1 and 2, Horse Head Lives, etc."
2012-08-04‎@freakshow180 and lmao no shit!  XD
2012-08-04‎@imatu777 That's not me...
2012-08-04‎@freakshow180 haha yeah, I still have it bookmarked
2012-08-04‎@JigsawdeadPage I just don't even know with YouTube anymore. I haven't for the past 3 years.
2012-08-03‎I'd say it's physically impossible for anyone to imitate my voice. I'd kill to see anyone do it.
2012-08-03‎Another YouTube change, another FAIL....
2012-08-03‎"If you uncheck ""Show Uploads Only"", it's a mess. There's every activity from all 200 of my subscriptions in one stack."
2012-08-03‎The put the X back a few days ago and yet they take it away again. Now all videos I watch are transparent and huge.
2012-08-03‎YouTube's new homepage is a disaster.
2012-08-03‎For some reason I had to urge to edit it, so enjoy!
2012-08-03‎There's time codes in the video description to hear differences in tracks.
2012-08-03‎And also check out this Mirrored Theory Medley Remix if you haven't - http://t.co/Kxh4XVfr  It get's better the farther you get into the mix
2012-08-03‎@freakshow180 That is by far, one of the funniest things you have edited together
2012-08-03‎RT @freakshow180: I totally found that commercial http://t.co/78k7dV91
2012-08-03‎RT @freakshow180: I heard that @PioneersProd was in a Jif peanut butter commercial years ago.
2012-08-03‎@freakshow180 That is...just...lmfaoooo!
2012-08-03‎"New video ""A Whale Of A Wake Up Call!"" if you haven't seen it yet! - http://t.co/1oeYSLWI"
2012-08-03‎@freakshow180 lmao
2012-08-03‎@jaelentruong I have them off too, gonna be sweet.
2012-08-03‎@makemebad35 if it was a spider bite it would probably hurt like a mofo. I got a few ant bites the other week and it itched a lot.
2012-08-03‎Music cures everything.
2012-08-03‎@TheZacMartin One of the best movies I've seen in ages.
2012-08-03‎@TheZacMartin So I don't know. So this would be the third time.
2012-08-03‎@TheZacMartin It's not a bad idea but it's just kind of the same thing I did with the Alligator/Horse Head concept of shipping it away.
2012-08-03‎It's a little messy but nonetheless not too bad!
2012-08-03‎Edited together an @MirroredTheory medley remix - http://t.co/m5jzwJyV  Not perfect but stunned I managed to connect these songs together.
2012-08-03‎@imatu777 haha now who's deleting videos?  =P
2012-08-03‎@reallesstroud Can't wait for your new episodes Les!
2012-08-03‎RT @reallesstroud: Hey everyone - a great article by Whitney Matheson. http://t.co/Z5WBlK7R
2012-08-02‎This was a suburban road too. Rarely see cops sit there.
2012-08-02‎I swear my family is plagued by cops. I got 2 tickets in 2 years, my bro one last year, my dad just now for speeding. Da fucckk?!
2012-08-02‎@smpfilms One of the best albums I've ever bought.
2012-08-02‎"@smpfilms Nathan's ""Dream"" album is incredible. I still haven't gotten tired of it. Still hard to fathom he's passed on."
2012-08-02‎And by far the best one he's made. Still hard to fathom he's passed on.
2012-08-02‎"The ""Dream"" Album by @nathanwills is pure awesomeness. Still haven't gotten tired of listening to it. One of the best albums I've bought."

2012-08-02‎@RandomShadowMan Well it's just the internet. People come and go =/
2012-08-02‎@JigsawdeadPage That is the question  =)
2012-08-02‎"I made it muffled because it just seemed too...well..""gay"" lol"
2012-08-02‎Did anyone figure out the hidden Whale vocal at the very END of the video where it cuts to black? Very deep meaning if you figure it out lol
2012-08-02‎"RT @FNC: I don't get this commertial. If someone said ""Let's have a Barbecue"" and took me to Burger King I'd be pissed."
2012-08-02‎"New video, ""A Whale Of A Wake Up Call!"" - http://t.co/r2u02j2D  I can't seem to get any peace and quiet around here anymore..."
2012-08-02‎@imatu777 love what you've done though with the videos. It's awesome. You made them 10x better than what they were.
2012-08-02‎@imatu777 I tried eliminating that history and then you came along haha You won't let me erase it  XD
2012-08-02‎@imatu777 Other than that, never saved them. Cleaned them out when I switched to the mac.
2012-08-02‎@imatu777 Yeah the only pic I had was the profile pic where I'm sitting in my chair in my room in front of the computer. But it was tiny.
2012-08-02‎@imatu777 I don't. Not even on flash drives.
2012-08-02‎I shot it around 7 at night as the sun was setting yet with editing tricks, it looks like a morning sunrise  ;D http://t.co/W045QbmX
2012-08-02‎@IsaacHarby not sure. I usually do them when I feel like it.
2012-08-02‎New Whale video out tomorrow. A very crazy one indeed lol
2012-08-02‎RT @smpfilms: RIP Nathan Wills http://t.co/FTwKsEKV
2012-08-01‎@imatu777 that's just crazy lol I had a YuGiOh video once called A Man's Game. It was just like makemebad35's Angry Gamer but 2 years before
2012-08-01‎@imatu777 Ohh noo...
2012-08-01‎@freakshow180 I'm sick of all of those text pics in general.
2012-08-01‎@dpnh I know. Forget the last time I talked to him.
2012-08-01‎@dpnh Yes, he messaged me today about it. Craziness haha
2012-08-01‎@dpnh Heyyyoo!
2012-08-01‎@imatu777 Think I ran away from the horse head from the basement upstairs. Can't remember much else but not sure if you still have that one.
2012-08-01‎@imatu777 not sure if you remember Run for Your Life where I went down the stairs in the sleeping bag (the escape hatch) at the end?
2012-08-01‎New Whale video out Thursday. Been since Christmas since you've seen him. http://t.co/2Og22Pkn
2012-08-01‎"@imatu777 Oh man ""Home Invasion"" I barely remember doing. Can't believe you had that saved."
2012-08-01‎This may very well be the craziest I've voice-overed for a whale video. My throats in shreds.
2012-07-31‎Can you guess what I'm shooting?  =) http://t.co/6lvLMwVa
2012-07-31‎Thank you ToxicXEternity for making awesome metal music!
2012-07-31‎Mr. Horse Head Lives Music Video - https://t.co/BFu8cPqU Put this together in about an hour and felt like sharing. The song seems to fit.
2012-07-31‎Just realizing that now since he was decapitated and his head was in Damian's bed. Now in Horse Head Lives he's in one piece...well mostly..
2012-07-31‎Funny, I'm surprised after Alligator/Horse Head 2 when I made Mr. Horse Head Lives, no one asked how he got his head back on.
2012-07-31‎WTF??! -  http://t.co/uTq0vqnB
2012-07-31‎@NkotbsbZoe Glad you like my videos, followed  =)
2012-07-31‎"So last night I said ""You're a towel. Got the towel? Yeah"" and made a sound after that made it seem I was high. Wtf?"
2012-07-31‎"RT @smpfilms: NEVER delete pictures and videos!  No matter how ""bad"" they are, one day, they just might be the most precious video you have."
2012-07-31‎@freakshow180 and I got work in the mornings
2012-07-31‎@freakshow180 same here!
2012-07-31‎@makemebad35 So now I see why that guy thought I destroyed it. That's screwed up. Didn't even touch it. I just ran past it.
2012-07-31‎@makemebad35 So I looked at the mw3 clip of that sam turrant or whatever and I ran past it, about 8 ft from it and it just destroyed itself.
2012-07-30‎Read the video description.
2012-07-30‎used to post videos on. The channel was Point2122. I have four of these old videos recovered and will post throughout the week.
2012-07-30‎"Old 2008 video as I was just starting PioneersProductions, ""The Mysterious Car"" - http://t.co/CDAhKjVN A video on a channel me and my bro"

2012-07-30‎I just...dont't even know anymore....
2012-07-30‎So what the fuck. Last night I dreamed @makemebad35 was working at White Castle, walking around humming to himself. WTF??!
2012-07-30‎@imatu777 wtf?
2012-07-30‎@ThatOneNugget well I never unfollowed :D
2012-07-30‎Wtf brain??!
2012-07-30‎Always when I know I have to get up early I can NEVER sleep.It takes me an hour or more at times.I dont drink caffeine before bed.
2012-07-30‎@imatu777 Like, Mr. Horse Head (the original video) has that cutoff to me. That's when things got different. Everything there on changed.
2012-07-30‎@imatu777 It doesn't even feel like they're my videos.
2012-07-30‎@imatu777 Yeah &amp; even my main channel videos from 2009/2010.It's like a different chapter of my life. I cant believe how different I am now.
2012-07-30‎@imatu777 I can't believe how different I was back in those videos. Wow  =X
2012-07-30‎@ThatOneNugget Hey! Not too bad here. I always forget since you twitter name is different.
2012-07-30‎- http://t.co/a9u7T9t9  The older one I posted on PioneersClassics had a portion cut out. This is the true video.
2012-07-30‎"If you remember ""Chip's An Apple!"" The video back in 2009 that started the ""makemebad"" type skits, here's the OFFICIAL VERSION of it"
2012-07-30‎@imatu777 I can't believe you have those older 2nd channel videos. You've really been saving  =X
2012-07-30‎@imatu777 Just saw you added more old stuff to the cloud storage site. Downloading now lol
2012-07-30‎WTF? Apparently I am the Dark Knight? - http://t.co/nIDAgUkt

2012-07-29‎@makemebad35 not sure if AMC has that feature too
2012-07-29‎@makemebad35 you cant watch on AMCs website? I know FX's site has shows on their site to watch for like 5-8 of the latest episodes
2012-07-29‎Pretty lengthy though, almost 11 mins long  =X  Debated on cutting it in half but don't want to bother uploading two videos.
2012-07-29‎On a positive note, got a funny yearbook collection video coming out on the 2nd channel either tomorrow or Tuesday afternoon.
2012-07-29‎That's crazy. I had just purchased one of his albums two days ago. Can't believe he took his own life. Life's just crazy anymore...
2012-07-29‎@IsaacHarby I don't even recall following? No matter, followed.
2012-07-29‎RT @smpfilms: RIP @nathanwills.  I hope you knew how much you were loved. :'(
2012-07-29‎What the fuckk?! @nathanwills passed away? Damn, man  =(   #RIPnathanwills  Sorry for your loss @smpfilms
2012-07-28‎Everyone wish @kungfualice a happy birthday!
2012-07-28‎Time to drift off to a land of craziness...
2012-07-28‎Sometime down the road.
2012-07-28‎Might split it into two portions since it's 10 mins already and I didn't even do 9th-11th grade yet. And eventually will tell stories.
2012-07-28‎Got a yearbook collage video coming out on the 2nd channel this weekend. Showing every yearbook photo of me. Ohh boyyyy!
2012-07-28‎Looks like @Cinemassacre was here.. http://t.co/sT1fJIce
2012-07-27‎My account was made in 2005. Crazy how fast that flew. I don't even recognize half the people on there anymore.
2012-07-27‎Wow, just logged into my old AIM Instant Messenger account and can't believe the contacts I had in there are still there lol
2012-07-27‎@TheZacMartin That they do. I still think it's faster than what it used to be. HD files are just huge so takes forever.
2012-07-27‎"@TheZacMartin instead of a ""Feed"" tab on your channel, there's a ""Browse"" box where the comments, activity, etc is stored."
2012-07-27‎@TheZacMartin It's just when YouTube decides. My 2nd channel seems to get the changes before my main. The sub feed is different and
2012-07-27‎@TheZacMartin From what I know, some people have had it for months.
2012-07-27‎@TheZacMartin Main channel doesn't have it yet. Video thumbnails are bigger in the subscriber feeds and profile pics are on the top left.
2012-07-26‎@imatu777 In the New Blood, Manhattan, and Jason X, Hodder played Jason. Maybe Hell too but not sure on that.
2012-07-26‎@imatu777 He's my favorite Jason actor.
2012-07-26‎@imatu777 Jason X was okay, not my favorite. Just doesn't work being away from Crystal Lake. But Kane Hodder really makes it interesting.
2012-07-26‎"@imatu777 Jason X I also had to buy separate I guess since those two didn't have ""Friday the 13th"" in the titles."
2012-07-26‎@imatu777 I just had to buy Jason Goes to Hell since it didn't come with the set. I never saw that one but heard it's not that great.
2012-07-26‎@imatu777 and extra stuff.Even a bonus DVD with secrets behind the gore &amp; such. Just as good if not better than owning individual copies =)
2012-07-26‎@imatu777 Friday the 13th - Jason Takes Manhattan all came in a box set that I got for Christmas years back. They all have commentaries
2012-07-26‎@jfra not sure if they doctored the DVD version to eliminate the use of glasses. But it's one of my favorite ones.
2012-07-26‎@jfra Yeah that would be neat. Interesting since you didn't need 3D glasses for that movie back then.
2012-07-26‎@imatu777 Grr, my search continues!
2012-07-26‎My Halloween collection is complete! http://t.co/vK9GQqyI
2012-07-26‎My Friday the 13th collection is complete! http://t.co/FYJOkqCu
2012-07-26‎@TheZacMartin  Now it's nice, on my 2nd channel there's a new layout where they brought back the X button to hide videos in your sub feed.
2012-07-26‎Freak windstorm blew through here. So much stuff thrown everywhere. Went out to eat, trash all over the parking lot. Crazy..
2012-07-26‎Tornado warning, ohhh shittt!
2012-07-26‎"@freakshow180 When they said ""There's a storm coming Mr. Wayne"" I almost burst out laughing in the theater last week lmao From you."
2012-07-26‎Only four weeks until I go back to college?? Summer, slowww downnn!
2012-07-26‎@TheArchfiend What special project were you going to do when Shane Dawson became number one most subscribed on YouTube?
2012-07-26‎@TheStupidWizard with Instagram I forgot all about Dailybooth. Never posted on there though.
2012-07-26‎@imatu777 That's my account on the wikia that commented just so you know it's real.
2012-07-26‎What crazy stuff are we going to dream about tonight mr. brain??
2012-07-26‎@imatu777 tutorials on youtube. Sounds funny though but I don't have the editing tools to pull that off.
2012-07-26‎@imatu777 I tried a split screen for Horse Head Lives but after hours of playing around with it I couldn't figure it out. Even looked up
2012-07-26‎@imatu777 thats tricky editing for that.iMovie is more difficult believe it or not compared to the split-screen effect I had for movie maker
2012-07-26‎@imatu777 I have no words after reading this...
2012-07-26‎@freakshow180 haha you actually would film with people home?
2012-07-26‎@IsaacHarby I always do  =)
2012-07-26‎@imatu777 testing the new profile pic. Different formats.
2012-07-26‎@IsaacHarby Yeah loads better when the chat isn't flooded with people. Easier to communicate back to people lol
2012-07-26‎@dpnh I'm not concerned about it, since my shows are hours long. I don't need to save them.
2012-07-26‎@dpnh Strange, I dont have a live tab. What's really weird is on my 2nd channel there's a store tab.
2012-07-26‎@freakshow180 You'd make great shows.
2012-07-26‎@freakshow180 You know you wanna use the YouTube Live broadcaster on your channel  =P
2012-07-26‎@dpnh Now you can X out the hangout videos. Awesome.
2012-07-26‎@IsaacHarby Ah okay, thanks for stopping in! I'm as new to the feature as anyone else lol
2012-07-26‎YESS! @YouTube finally brought back the X button to hide videos from subscriber feeds!
2012-07-26‎@imatu777 I dont even think that's a side channel of ishatonu. Same mask but probably different guy. Only 70 views..
2012-07-26‎@IsaacHarby Yoo!
2012-07-26‎@imatu777 For some reason I commented a year ago on it. Don't remember seeing this lol Doesn't remotely relate to my video lmao
2012-07-26‎@TheZacMartin They haven't worked all the kinks out of it yet. Like the dead subscriber videos. But great thing to try out!
2012-07-26‎Delete the show from the my videos section it's still there in the feed. But nonetheless, great idea @YouTube!
2012-07-26‎Only thing that sucks is the dead videos that will be in your subscriber feeds. I can't do anything about that, sorry =X  Even though I
2012-07-26‎The YouTube Live Broadcaster is actually pretty nifty! Thanks for those watching, was fun! Might do that from now on instead of blogtv.
2012-07-25‎Live show tonight on YOUTUBE, not blogtv at 7pm ET - http://t.co/gF5Bc7lJ  I'll post the show page when I start it up. First time trying it.
2012-07-25‎Might try that new YouTube Live broadcaster in a couple hours for a bit and see how it goes. Stay tuned.
2012-07-25‎You can download old videos of mine and see pre-PioneersProductions stuff here for free thanks to @imatu777 http://t.co/rw9eMtrP
2012-07-25‎The first second is me screaming. So if you wear earbuds, please adjust your volume lol
2012-07-25‎"Also new video out on PioneersClassics ""Chatroulette Insanity!"" - http://t.co/Ww4mZbZp  Fair warning, TURN DOWN YOUR VOLUME!"
2012-07-25‎Possible 2 Bloopers! - http://t.co/82LEHmqM  Lots of crazy ones haha

2012-07-25‎RT @freakshow180: Christian Bale has been visting the victims of the theater shooting in the hospital. That's actually pretty nice of him.
2012-07-25‎@freakshow180 I saw that. I remember seeing a popular pic of a post going around saying Bale should do that. Anything to help the situation.
2012-07-25‎@mldnl It's Firefox. I don't always wear the earbuds but thanks for the tip!
2012-07-25‎Check out this wikia @imatu777 made of me - http://t.co/E8yoXH1P  lots of interesting info lol
2012-07-25‎That pic doesn't even look like me.

2012-07-25‎@mldnl Really? Seems to only happen when I click to go to another part of a website. Guess it makes sense.
2012-07-25‎God I fricken hate it when my earbuds just randomly make a slight pop sound when Im using them on the computer.Why does this have to happen?
2012-07-24‎Not as many people watch my 2nd channel so might at well post bloopers there. Bloopers will be out tomorrow.
2012-07-24‎Going to start putting bloopers out on my main channel and use the 2nd channel (PioneersProductions2) for short vlogs.
2012-07-24‎@Ricketts4644 Not you saying that, the people telling you that. Good movie nonetheless!
2012-07-24‎@Ricketts4644 Jeez, that's not even funny. It's actually a pretty long movie though, but doesn't seem like it once the action gets going.
2012-07-24‎@makemebad35 but I showed some of them. 10x worse than my 2008 ones when I started out lol
2012-07-24‎"@makemebad35 Go for it. I posted videos from around 6th grade on my 2nd channel called ""Blast From The Past"". It's like 20 mins long"
2012-07-24‎How Is It Possible 2 bloopers will be out later today hopefully. Really debating whether I should post on the main or 2nd.
2012-07-24‎@makemebad35 you there just for today? Have fun!
2012-07-24‎@makemebad35 That's only 2 hours from me. Do the Stormrunner!

2012-07-24‎Is it just me or does 3:55 into this video sound like me from 2008 - http://t.co/IO0VjZhx  Hugh Jass (The Burglar) much?
2012-07-23‎Saw The Dark Knight Rises last night, couldn't live up to the Dark Knight but I guess it was pretty good. A little long but good.

2012-07-19‎"@makemebad35 I bet it cant beat ""Busy Bee""  =)"
2012-07-19‎@JigsawdeadPage I'll figure it out down the road.
2012-07-19‎@JigsawdeadPage Youtube would be lots easier for people to watch since they don't need to sign up but blogtv has better quality.
2012-07-19‎@JigsawdeadPage I did a test recording earlier but there was nothing in sub boxes saying I was live. The video published in the boxes after.
2012-07-19‎@JigsawdeadPage that's what I mean. It's the video with my profile pic right?
2012-07-19‎Like months ago, I even deleted the video from the my videos page right after it was uploaded. Still stuck in the sub boxes.
2012-07-19‎Yet Mystery Guitar Man's video goes away when he finishes broadcasting. What's going on herzz??
2012-07-19‎The quality isn't the greatest compared to BlogTv though. So not sure which I should stick to...
2012-07-19‎But it still for some reason posts an annoying deleted video in the sub boxes from the test video I did. @YouTube fix this!
2012-07-19‎So it looks like I now have the Live broadcaster on my YouTube channel. Still confused why it doesn't appear in my sub box feed.
2012-07-19‎Jeez, lately I've been having so many dreams about people dying. What is going on here??

2012-05-22‎I ran around screaming, jumped on the back of a car &amp; started shouting that I had the better SpongeBob &amp; Patrick voice. What da eFfFfFf???!
2012-05-22‎Man if only my dreams dialogue could be transferred from my mind to Sleep Talk. I would be considered insane.

2012-05-21‎@ScottiScittles Awesomeness!
2012-05-21‎@livinginthenorm sounds like a relief!
2012-05-21‎@ScottiScittles There was one time where the user said they werent working. Just want to make sure so I can delete the footage from my mac.
2012-05-21‎@ScottiScittles So they take hours to send which sucks BUT is worth it in the long run at least. The download links worked though right?
2012-05-21‎@ScottiScittles No was day here when I finally sent it. Had to stay around the computer. But so glad it finally sent. HD files are so big.
2012-05-21‎Friend climbing a tree to get his $8 fishing leur back. Dedication haha http://t.co/55UKDHyO
2012-05-20‎Something always seems to go wrong when I go to do these lol and also supposed to rain all week, it's an outdoor video, greattt..
2012-05-20‎Couldn't get the public video done this weekend. Ran out of time so gotta wait until later in the week.
2012-05-20‎@ScottiScittles Hopefully was what you expected lol
2012-05-20‎@ScottiScittles Alright sent it all luckily. So should have it all now in your email, two clips. Enjoy!
2012-05-20‎The unfinished Xbox video from two months ago - http://t.co/sMwi9xdc  Wasnt turning out like I'd hoped.
2012-05-20‎@ScottiScittles Okay should have the first clip in your email. Just got one left to send.
2012-05-20‎@ScottiScittles Trying my best to send 1 of 2 now.
2012-05-20‎@ScottiScittles This never happens, so guess I'll have to keep making sure the monitor doesnt go to sleep. B/c it never even hits 1%
2012-05-20‎@ScottiScittles Fuck, it still didnt send. You're gonna have to postpone that video since I wont be able to be around the computer until Mon
2012-05-20‎@freakshow180 Doubt it haha when do you think it'll be out?
2012-05-20‎RT @freakshow180: Damn... darkest video I've ever made, lol. Hope it doesn't get flagged. It shouldn't. It'll be up later this week.
2012-05-20‎@jadenam1447 I know he didnt have the original idea of calling it public trollin though.We'll see.Ill have a couple days to think of a title
2012-05-20‎@jadenam1447 I dont know. If I call it Public Trollin people are gonna bash on me on how it's copying Damian.
2012-05-20‎@ScottiScittles If it doesnt send tonight, you'll have to most likely postpone. I gotta shoot all day tomorrow and have work tomorrow night.
2012-05-20‎@ScottiScittles Yeah we'll see what happens. I've been super busy lately so am at least glad I got this filmed that quick.
2012-05-19‎Will shoot mine tomorrow.
2012-05-19‎Well ran out of time to shoot my video but got one done with freakshow (james), which may after it's edited start a conspiracy about me lol
2012-05-19‎@RandomShadowMan G+ pretty much IS your account now. And you have to dig deep into account settings to get a channel url. Awful.
2012-05-19‎@RandomShadowMan I created a new account a month back or so and was so f'd up it's crazy how they incorporate G+ into your account.
2012-05-19‎@RandomShadowMan Onision hit the nail on the head in that video. I can personally say new users are scraping the bottom of the shit barrel
2012-05-19‎@jadenam1447 what?? lol
2012-05-19‎@lizzieish Thanks for watchin!
2012-05-19‎Shooting a public trollin like video today, wish me luck!

2012-05-19‎You know, some days I wake up and cant believe I have a drivers license, a job, and drive a car. All the things I was nervous about I have.
2012-05-18‎Highlight of my day, my friend climbing a tree over the pond, leaning over the water to get his $8 fishing leur back. #CRAZINESS!

2012-05-16‎@JigsawdeadPage Ah really? Didn't know that.
2012-05-16‎Like even the time uploaded is glitched. Someone uploaded it yesterday but says 28 minutes ago.
2012-05-16‎@ScottiScittles Oh sorry, now you should be able to. I had to follow you first.
2012-05-16‎"I'm getting fed up with my YouTube homepage sub boxes being switched to ""Highlights"" instead of ""Everything"". It's been so glitchy."

2012-05-14‎Stunned at the amount of subs AVGN has lost.
2012-05-14‎Can't handle criticism. Why keep making comments set to approval and ratings disabled??
2012-05-14‎Mike is ruining AVGN  X(  I like him and all but damn enough with the censoring and removing videos.
2012-05-14‎@CyberAceTV Well huge congrats man!
2012-05-14‎@CyberAceTV Wow, that's craziness!
2012-05-13‎But I know some are really looking forward to this thing. Anyways filming a new video in public this week so keep an eye out for that!
2012-05-13‎Just not as fun anymore as it used to be for some reason. So idk, but the footage is great so far. Most I'll be doing it shooting at times.
2012-05-13‎Lots of stuff in this thing and cant keep up so he's running it. It will be posted on my Facebook when it's up.
2012-05-13‎Chances are youre not going to see me much if at all in this Fatass thing. It's my bro's project and just gonna let him do the work.

2012-05-11‎Getting back to making videos this week since college is out, keep a look out!
2012-05-11‎Never know though, has to be me. I'm in another world when I go lights out. Guess I make noises I never thought I could make.
2012-05-11‎Does NOT sound like me haha
2012-05-11‎"It's titled ""wtf"". Sounds like someone else says ""is there somethin"" and sounds like I say ""can't get in here now cuz there's...."""

2012-05-11‎@hawk4444 that wasn't from us playing
2012-05-11‎@LucasCruikshank It was alright the first time I tried it but then got progressively more fishy as I dug into it. I'm 50 50 with it.
2012-05-11‎@CyberAceTV Been wanting to try it out!
2012-05-11‎@CyberAceTV Nice, see you got the Live feature for youtube. For some reason my G+ doesnt have it though, not sure why.
2012-05-10‎@kungfualice good luck! fight the pain!
2012-05-10‎@kungfualice lmao!
2012-05-10‎@dpnh yeah same email and everything.
2012-05-10‎@dpnh pretty sure it's the same gmail. I'll check in a bit.
2012-05-10‎@freakshow180 but I didnt even do it lol I did it asleep somehow. What next haha
2012-05-10‎*had a dream within a dream
2012-05-10‎Because I know for sure it was off. That's so strange lol
2012-05-10‎WHAT DA FUCK??!
2012-05-10‎Apparently I just I a dream within a dream but get this, I somehow set my alarm AFTER I was asleep &amp; and said how did I set it when asleep
2012-05-10‎@RandomShadowMan haha thought you'd like that
2012-05-09‎@dpnh Ah alright that makes sense now!
2012-05-09‎@TheZacMartin I know Live sucks, I had to use it to send audio clips for my xbox video. It's confusing as hell.
2012-05-09‎@dpnh That's strange though. Not sure if it's because I deleted my G+ and made a new one. Hope it's not for original users =X
2012-05-09‎@TheZacMartin Never really figured out how to upload in a 480p high quality. I know there's programs to compress more though.
2012-05-09‎@TheZacMartin All depends on the compression really. I've had three minute videos take an hour an a half at times. I use iMovie.
2012-05-09‎@TheZacMartin Just a glitch, it's back now
2012-05-09‎@freakshow180 Let me know whenever you're up for filming. I know you said you needed to get one done.
2012-05-09‎@dpnh Slight problem, I don't have that enable on air check box. Everything else was the same as your video but I dont see that..
2012-05-09‎@FNC Not sure yet, open for anything. Long break compared to high school lol
2012-05-09‎Crazy freshman year of college is over already! Does not feel like in a month I'll be out of high school a year already. Hello summer!
2012-05-09‎@dpnh I know, I still got another two years but this one flew!
2012-05-09‎@freakshow180 Wait'll you start taking the classes you major in, it'll go even faster!
2012-05-09‎@RandomShadowMan Like it way better than high school but I had my ups and downs throughout the year. Just glad to be finally done!
2012-05-09‎Hard to believe today's my last day of freshman year of college. Damn!
2012-05-09‎@FNC I can only imagine with you Jared lol
2012-05-09‎@freakshow180 You got me into that 90s life twitter now lol
2012-05-09‎@The90sLife lmao!
2012-05-09‎@dpnh Alright, gonna have to do it tomorrow since I got finals to study for right now.
2012-05-09‎@dpnh Just unsure how that connects to your youtube page? Give me some info later if you could, thanks!
2012-05-09‎@dpnh I'll have to look into that. I deleted my G+ though, so that probably affects it. Have to sign up again.

2012-05-01‎"@makemebad35 I've been mumbling stuff lately but two nights ago I said ""Creepy HAHA"" and heard a strange noise in the backing of the tape"
2012-04-30‎@gamezdeluna All I had this year was general classes so havent even touched communication classes yet.
2012-04-30‎@yosoyian ...and life is CRAZY!
2012-04-30‎@TheZacMartin My work schedule will remain mostly unchanged so we'll see. I do have lots of ideas.
2012-04-30‎@gamezdeluna I know. College has been easy at times but I've had my fair share moments this year. Ready to be done and finally take majors.
2012-04-30‎Crazy to think this is my last week of freshman year of college. CRAZIENESS!
2012-04-30‎@cinemassacre haha that's def. the Nerd
2012-04-30‎"And last night in my sleep I said ""Creepy Haha"" after thinking about it. Now THAT is creepy lol Got it on the sleep talk app."
2012-04-30‎Jeez, every time I think about the smiling family from Insidious before bed I cant sleep. That scene still freaks me out haha
2012-04-29‎@freakshow180 I remember Tropic Thunder they blackfaced someone
2012-04-29‎@freakshow180 @imatu777 I was thinking to deep into it for some reason.
2012-04-29‎@freakshow180 @imatu777 Ah okay, using black makeup? No can't see me doing that haha
2012-04-29‎@imatu777 What is that?
2012-04-29‎@cinemassacre Certainly won't be hard to act pissed in scenes though!

2012-04-29‎"Done editing. New ""Sucks"" video out tomorrow!"
2012-04-29‎Been like this for weeks. Have like 80 songs on the flash drive. Maybe thats why?
2012-04-29‎For some reason it's been taking as long as five minutes to play music on my Xbox when I start it up, what's going on?! I just hit play all.

2012-04-28‎Okay why did I see a Mr. Horse Head app on the facebook search? I clicked it but said it isnt available. Hmm.. lol
2012-04-28‎@makemebad35 The things we think of XD
2012-04-28‎@makemebad35 Like my videos some actually like the bloopers more than the video itself haha Strange what happens at random when you fuck up.
2012-04-28‎Good picks so far @dallascowboys Gotta work on that defense #AmericasTeam
2012-04-28‎@89Kris Yeah I have a lot of bots/spam followers. Facebook gets more activity. But do like twitter since it's clean and easy.
2012-04-28‎@gamezdeluna Thanks for the FFs man!
2012-04-28‎@89Kris I used to always do them but never think of it anymore.
2012-04-28‎@89Kris Always appreciate the FFs!
2012-04-28‎Also the eerie thing was in the dream it actually was a Friday night. Spooky but glad I made it home okay tonight haha
2012-04-28‎Actually make that four. And also most of them have dealt with me leaving work at night.
2012-04-28‎Me driving and floating off in it during at flood on a river. Is this an omen?!
2012-04-28‎Im dead nervous and concerned about my car. I've had three dreams lately where either someone tried to steal my car at gunpoint or
2012-04-28‎Same manager on and everything at work. Creepy!
2012-04-28‎A bit nervous, I was in the same situation i am now as I was in my dream last night and ended up getting my car stolen.

2012-04-26‎Come on Cowboys, we need a good draft!
2012-04-26‎Got my mom into using the sleep talk app. Last night I was talking as if answering a phone. Very strange...Great app though haha

2012-04-26‎@iFahmi13 I had to do a paper that was assigned from the beginning of the semester and finally handed it in today. So relieved!

2012-04-26‎@kungfualice Could only imagine how pissed you would have been if they lost lol
2012-04-26‎@JigsawdeadPage Never mind, figured it out!
2012-04-26‎@JigsawdeadPage photo library. Idk how to change that. Any idea?
2012-04-26‎@JigsawdeadPage Giving me a hassle. Says I can only upload instagram phots from photo stream but when I transfer from the mac they go into
2012-04-26‎Add me on Instagram if you use it. My account is PioneersProductions   Finally figured out a way to use it without the iTouch camera.
2012-04-25‎@TheZacMartin Spam followers.
2012-04-25‎Also new 2nd channel video about my NES that I bought - http://t.co/fH0b30VY
2012-04-25‎Just caught 14 fricken fish and a bigass bass fishing! Craziness!

2012-04-25‎Ah that's right, Somber was my last video. My bad.
2012-04-25‎Just wrote it and must say this one HAD to be made.
2012-04-25‎@JigsawdeadPage You just saved this guy $200  =)
2012-04-25‎@TheZacMartin Don't really have 500. Lots are bots and mostly people who have seen my makemebad collabs.
2012-04-25‎@JigsawdeadPage Alright, thanks for the info! Defeats the purpose of using the iPod but I'll take it!
2012-04-25‎New video out possibly Saturday. Feels like it's been forever. I think How Is It Possible was my last video!
2012-04-25‎@JigsawdeadPage How do you post to instagram from your computer?
2012-04-25‎@bones6691 We play every other night or so, not a crushing blow lol
2012-04-25‎@smpfilms I'm guessing you've seen the first jackass movie haha
2012-04-24‎@JigsawdeadPage I use an old NV touch. Dont have the money to pay for an iPhone. Too much for internet.
2012-04-24‎Looks like no Instagram for mehh! Not paying $180 for a new one either. That blows.
2012-04-24‎Just great, sent my iTouch all the way to California to fix the camera (under warranty) &amp; they said it was caused by misuse so not fixing it
2012-04-24‎@KristinRoseFNC Broke my collarbone in kindergarten. That was the worst that's happened to me.
2012-04-24‎Hard to believe next Friday is my last day of being a college freshman. Man that flew!
2012-04-24‎Dreams man....just dont..make..SENSE!

2012-04-23‎I'll be posting pics along the way on my Facebook.
2012-04-23‎So going to be months before this is all out.
2012-04-23‎"Those wondering, we're going to be filming all throughout summer for Fatass and compile it all into one full length ""movie""."
2012-04-23‎RT @FNC: There should be a law if you see idiots texting and driving you can ram them off the road. I would have a blast.
2012-04-23‎Gotta go the entire week without my iPod since I'm finally getting the camera on it fixed. Looks like I'll be reverting back to CDs again!
2012-04-23‎@89Kris yeah didnt end too well haha
2012-04-23‎@JigsawdeadPage Yeah I'll have to check it out! We've been doing vids for four years almost. We were pretty young when we started.
2012-04-23‎Got some great footage today! Wait'll you see how the Gallon Challenge ends in this one! Going to edit the entire episode into one video.
2012-04-22‎@kungfualice Why dont you have a youtube channel yet?
2012-04-22‎Rained pretty bad but wasnt too much a factor.
2012-04-22‎Well got some good stuff filmed already but going to be a few more shoots before we get everything done.
2012-04-22‎@MrsanprodHD2 yeah, a secret life of me pretty much that people have rarely seen. Those video go back to 2008.
2012-04-22‎The videos are like Jackass so funny stuff.
2012-04-22‎But doing lots of public stuff. Can't wait!
2012-04-22‎Gonna take a while to film the entire thing but I'll mostly be filming this one so wont be in it much. Using the T2i so I gotta operate it.
2012-04-22‎Filming a new Fatass episode today since it's been years. If you've never seen them check them out - http://t.co/wiiAeDze
2012-04-22‎Getting a new iTouch hopefully soon so should be able to use Instagram. Add me, PioneersProductions
2012-04-22‎Just bought Inception. Been wanting to see this for ages but never bought it until now. This should be good.
2012-04-22‎Shooting the new Fatass episode tomorrow for those who remember it but sadly looks like rain.
2012-04-21‎Read that in my newspaper this morning. Mac's thankfully are protected better. But yeah something with IP addresses from clicking hacked ads

2012-04-21‎I would use instagram if my iTouch camera wasn't broken =\
2012-04-21‎RT @89Kris: @PioneersProd just wait until you get to like level 8 of that, it can change a man, haha XD
2012-04-21‎@89Kris One of my fav. games though but it is RELENTLESS!
2012-04-21‎@89Kris Trust me, it took me years to beat Mario 3. I must have gotten stuck on World 7 and 8 for an eternity on the game boy version.
2012-04-21‎NES! I feel like I'm 6 years old again  =D http://t.co/HReGiceg
2012-04-20‎@makemebad35 after you telling me a brief bit about it Im looking forward to it!  =D
2012-04-20‎RT @89Kris: @PioneersProd you better knock on wood or something after saying that, haha XD
2012-04-20‎Wow dead stunned, bought an NES and five games and all work flawlessly for the most part! Craziness!
2012-04-20‎@makemebad35 @kungfualice can't believe it's been a year already =(  thoughts and prayers to you today and stay positive =)
2012-04-19‎@RandomShadowMan Fuck stoners

2012-04-19‎Sorry Google+ but you're a bust  =/
2012-04-19‎By status I mean a normal post or an update on what is new. Every few mins all I saw was a video, news clip, explicit content, ETC.
2012-04-19‎Deleted my Google+. I cannot emphasize how much junk I see every minute on that site.Had 140+ contacts in my circle and never see one status
2012-04-19‎@dpnh lmao
2012-04-19‎@FNC Ahhh jeezzz, thanks for that Jared. Thats almost as bad as Friday....I think it's almost worse..
2012-04-19‎Just want to move on to something else. But will eventually go back to it!
2012-04-19‎It's two mins long but only like three reactions. I'll redo it better down the road and include those clips in it.
2012-04-19‎Well deciding to hold off on this Xbox thing for a while. The footage I have just isnt as good as I thought.
2012-04-19‎RT @freakshow180: Wait... it's 2012... Dick Clark died... The world is supposed to end in 2012... Dick Clark counted down the New Year.. ...
2012-04-19‎@paco13139 sweet!
2012-04-19‎@freakshow180 good to hear!
2012-04-19‎I hate when a user deletes a video that was in my favorites on YouTube but the title gets wiped, so I cant tell what video was removed. &gt;:/
2012-04-19‎@JWO92911 I like the Stars the most but theyre not even in it  =/

2012-04-18‎@gamezdeluna I know! ugh! Hate when it happens.
2012-04-18‎Bought an NES and five games. Got most of the games today but no console yet.
2012-04-18‎This game is fuckin horrible! - @cinemassacre http://t.co/DkFbupyG
2012-04-18‎I'm getting real sick of people shooting at me in my dreams.

2012-04-18‎@kungfualice @makemebad35 the man obviously loves his water
2012-04-17‎WTF iMovie?! - http://t.co/4wmRsNDk
2012-04-17‎@yosoyian It's a 2000 Nissan Altima
2012-04-17‎@89Kris I know right?
2012-04-17‎So it shut off my power steering and leaked fluid when I went to turn. Craziness.
2012-04-17‎Somehow, if that makes any sense I HAVE NO IDEA lol Sounded like I ran over a stick but turns out it was the nut the flew off. $113 ohh joyy
2012-04-17‎So the issue was some kind of nut fell off the belt who's pulley is reversing which is NEVER supposed to fall off but it did
2012-04-17‎Sounded like I ran over a stick but something dropped. Probably a belt.
2012-04-17‎Got to a garage and wouldnt start. Idk whats up but that SUCKED.
2012-04-17‎Somehow made it to a garage. Literally could not steer PERIOD. Must have drove 8 miles on the interstate not able to steer.
2012-04-17‎Car problems again just great. Conked out on me on the fricken interstate and cant even steer the car, wtf happened?!
2012-04-17‎I'm going to murder my alarm clock in four and a half hours..

2012-04-17‎Hopefully finish tomorrow...but...the assholes only come out at night..
2012-04-17‎Have to do a behind the scenes for this one showing the setup because it's been tedious.
2012-04-17‎Working on finishing up Xbox trolling possibly tomorrow afternoon.Its taken so long to get this all recorded.Still dont have enough footage
2012-04-16‎@mrsanproduction I'm great how about you?

2012-04-16‎@SpicyFirestorm Like I'll click file and work offline is checked.
2012-04-16‎@SpicyFirestorm Only thing I notice strange over the months is it says I'm working offline when I open the browser now and then, no idea why
2012-04-16‎@SpicyFirestorm never crashed on me. I mainly use Firefox.
2012-04-16‎@SpicyFirestorm and the whole crew won't be back but a good bit.
2012-04-15‎I love fishing. So relaxing.
2012-04-15‎@freakshow180 Yes sir!
2012-04-15‎@SpicyFirestorm Not sure, gonna take a few days to do everything on our list
2012-04-15‎I didnt do much over the years but we'll see next Sunday.
2012-04-15‎"Those who remember ""Fatass"", we're filming one last episode this Sunday. Check out these old videos here - http://t.co/wiiAeDze"

2012-04-15‎@Jessy_CYR_Fizzy Hello?!
2012-04-15‎Wow, #Titanic isn't even trending, whatt?!
2012-04-15‎@89Kris We got rid of our NES at a county clean up. Really wish I'd seen AVGN back then lol but our console hardly worked anymore.
2012-04-15‎"@89Kris I remember about ten years ago I bought Mario 3 and Mario 2 at a ""gamestop"" called EB Games at the time. Wish they still sold them."
2012-04-15‎"@89Kris and bought it off Amazon. There's loads of them and all are $50-$60 unless you buy a ""like new"" $500 one lol even saw one for $5000!"
2012-04-15‎@imatu777 I used to have the VHS set but had two tapes.
2012-04-15‎@89Kris The games were from 1 cent to $10, not bad at all, it's the NES that cost the bulk of it.
2012-04-14‎Crazy to think, 100 years ago tonight the #TITANIC sank.  1912 - 2012  RIP
2012-04-14‎Bought an NES, with 2 controllers and five games for $80. Not a bad price at all! I was expecting hundreds.
2012-04-14‎On your mark...get set....SHOENICE!   Just showed my mom and bro those videos.
2012-04-14‎BUT the real question will it work lol
2012-04-14‎Had two of them about six years ago and got rid of them. If only I had watched AVGN back then  =/
2012-04-14‎You know what? I'm bringing back a piece of my childhood I should never have approved getting rid of, an NES.
2012-04-14‎What the heck? Lady Gaga's Vevo channel has the old Beta layout. WTF?!
2012-04-14‎RT @TheArchfiend: I uploaded a @YouTube video http://t.co/7wv52TsG Why YouTube?  WHY!?  Cosmic Panda Controversy on Lady Gaga's
2012-04-14‎"It still amazes me that I get replies from people saying ""You're the first/only famous youtuber that's replied to me"". Im not famous  =X"
2012-04-13‎@gamezdeluna yeah there's app called sleep talk and I can hear myself turning
2012-04-13‎Also somehow managed to move the iTouch from one side to the other side of my bed UNDER s pillow, wtf?
2012-04-13‎@makemebad35 @Suckerlove23 lmfao!
2012-04-13‎Didn't talk in my sleep last night but damn I never realized how much I toss and turn!
2012-04-13‎So gonna give this sleep talk app a go and see what happens in the morning. Wonder if I do talk in my sleep!
2012-04-13‎@kungfualice Okayy  =P  better than the flyers though  =D
2012-04-13‎"@RandomShadowMan BUT eventually they're working that into the ""new"" partners. If that makes any sense lol Just missed the fine print."
2012-04-13‎"@RandomShadowMan going to stop accepting full partnership apps and that the ""new"" partners wont get custom thumbnails and branding"
2012-04-13‎@RandomShadowMan Every user can be partnered now if they have at least one monetized video. But at first people thought that youtube was
2012-04-13‎@kungfualice I like the Stars & Pens but not sure if the Stars are even in the post season. I like NHL but just never get a chance to follow
2012-04-13‎@dpnh Very true  =)  but sad thing is youtubes just been caring about $$$ the past few years since partners whored out the system. Sucks  =(
2012-04-13‎@TXBrad The blogspot responded to a comment saying they'll eventually get the thumbnail and other features.I just missed the comment earlier
2012-04-13‎@TXBrad Well the partners are the heart and soul of youtube nowadays.
2012-04-13‎Sorry about the big rant there lol didnt read the fine print WITHIN the fine print, fuck me. I was gonna say youtube cant sink THAT low!
2012-04-13‎@FNC I'm not pointing any fingers though. YouTube is YouTube.
2012-04-13‎@FNC my god. that's what youtube's become and sadly is the only way really to stay at the top.
2012-04-13‎"@FNC Any more it's ""favorite this, thumbs up for.., like for this.., tell me what you think...""which is fine for lower users but elite users"
2012-04-13‎@FNC yeah, which sucks for people that have to live off of the partnership program lower on the ladder.
2012-04-13‎"""we are working on making these and other features available to more partners over time""  Wish I saw this before I unloaded  X("
2012-04-13‎"WOW *facepalm*, quote: ""custom thumbnails and banners are sought-after features by many creators & we’d like you to know that"" (cont.)"
2012-04-13‎@makemebad35 Mm..wish I saw that comment before unloading haha ohhh boyyy *FACEPALM*  X(
2012-04-13‎@FNC I mean, their site they can change what they want but I swear each change it purposely done to suck worse than the last.
2012-04-13‎@FNC The whole site has been fucking itself over since the systems been whored out by elite partners for more $$$ Each change sucks harder.
2012-04-13‎@zxc90260 haha must be a local thing. Never heard of it.
2012-04-13‎@theapplenerdy Ah, they don't have partnership for there? Strange..
2012-04-12‎@theapplenerdy I just didnt read it thoroughly  =X
2012-04-12‎@theapplenerdy Turns out I was a bit wrong. It's a separate program. You don't get some of the benefits regular partners get.
2012-04-12‎@dpnh Ah really? Guess I didnt read the fine print. I know anyone can monetize these days though.
2012-04-12‎@hawk4444 My bro says I have once, and I think one of his friends told me I did. Think I was saying something about a dog.This is years ago.
2012-04-12‎@Apple_Fiend Glad you like the vids  =)
2012-04-12‎@TXBrad Wow you got partnered? Crazy!
2012-04-12‎@makemebad35 You should make a 2nd channel video out of it, like record every night for a week or so. Interested to hear mine lol
2012-04-12‎@makemebad35 Downloaded, this shall be interesting lol
2012-04-12‎@JigsawdeadPage I matched it up as best I could and some footage was somehow lost. I might have formatted the disk on accident but it's fine
2012-04-12‎@JigsawdeadPage Synching to my game play is the hard part since most of it is in the pregame lobby.
2012-04-12‎@JigsawdeadPage but thankfully in editing, I can open the audio to look for waves of sound rather than having to skim through it.
2012-04-12‎@JigsawdeadPage It's a mess really. I have so much game play footage and the headset audio is SEPARATE, which really sucks.
2012-04-12‎@JigsawdeadPage But probably will wrap it up next week. I already have 2 mins worth for a video, just need a bit more.
2012-04-12‎@JigsawdeadPage Not sure. It's taken forever to set up and get reactions. I'll have to put out a video on the process of it
2012-04-12‎Changes Coming to My YouTube Channel - http://t.co/5NWj6D2b  But it shall be a good change!
2012-04-12‎@rubennn____ I never have been either. The sound of my alarm clock brings my piss to a boil.
2012-04-12‎I cannot wait until summer so I don't have to wake up early. I miss that routine.
2012-04-11‎@AaronFuckingB The dad looks like you - http://t.co/41Zf0DkR  o_0
2012-04-11‎This is awesome - http://t.co/NQxRSjwQ
2012-04-11‎@makemebad35 Did you see this awesome painting a guy did from that elephant puppet video? - http://t.co/NQxRSjwQ
2012-04-11‎Finally tried the Dorito's Taco from Taco Bell. Wasnt bad, seemed cheesier.
2012-04-11‎@makemebad35 great news man! So glad he's alright.
2012-04-11‎@RandomShadowMan you certainly like your n_n faces XD
2012-04-11‎@cinemassacre Glad the shoots are going well! I can already picture myself watching it in the theater  =)
2012-04-10‎@imatu777 yeah was strange, must have been only temporary, the hell?
2012-04-10‎@imatu777 Not sure if you got my dm but the links expired or something last night before I got a chance to download. Strange...
2012-04-10‎So this should help interest a little bit of everyone with a variety of different types of vids. It will all happen after the xbox video.
2012-04-10‎@makemebad35 still praying for your grandfather to get better man, keep everyone posted  =)
2012-04-10‎Got more known just by parodying other users (damian, avgn, etc). So we'll see what the future holds for my videos.
2012-04-10‎I've gotten farther than I thought I ever would with that material but think it's time for a change. I don't want to be known as a guy who
2012-04-10‎"I'm looking forward to this BUT might leave lots of subscribers disappointed about not doing the ""makemebad"" type of skits often."
2012-04-10‎but mixing it up with a bunch of different stuff possibly. Like reviews, skits, suspense videos, and more.
2012-04-10‎Also might have big changes coming to my channel, changing material and such...like still doing what I do now here and there
2012-04-10‎Gonna be a while before my next video. Taking forever for this Xbox Trolling video to be put together.
2012-04-10‎@makemebad35 This is the kind of stuff I don't like reading. Very sorry about your grandfather and hope he gets well fast!
2012-04-10‎@dpnh anytime =]
2012-04-10‎"Wow, what a difference the 480p button is on YouTube now. Not sure if it's just for the video I just put out but it made it ""grayer"".."
2012-04-09‎Been wanting to remaster it for a while since I used to edit on windows movie maker, so mac made a hug difference!
2012-04-09‎Alligator/Horse Head Bloopers REMASTERED - http://t.co/rM1E7Czp Color correction,better audio & better fitting music,improved video quality!
2012-04-09‎@makemebad35 I got an instagram but my freakin iPod camera's been broken for months. So cant really use it  =X
2012-04-09‎@dpnh I'll always be there for you Dave  =)
2012-04-09‎@Suckerlove23 I'd sleep the whole day if I could at times.
2012-04-08‎@zxc90260 never had it!
2012-04-08‎Ben & Jerry's ice cream = FOODGASM!
2012-04-08‎So I had a dream where I was at Wendy's and woke up to a Wendy's gift card...eerie!
2012-04-08‎Happy Easter to those who celebrate!
2012-04-08‎@imatu777 Really? Damn haha been over half a year.
2012-04-08‎@imatu777 Some shots may have turned out a bit blueish though after correcting because of my old camera.
2012-04-08‎@imatu777 and color correction? Didn't think Alligator/Horse Head 2 would need it, since I had color corrected it myself lol
2012-04-08‎@cinemassacre can't wait for your finished product man, good luck with the rest of filming!
2012-04-08‎@jaelentruong Somebody's not getting an easter bunny visit!

2012-04-07‎FUCK! Flour shot right up my eye! GOD THE BURNS!
2012-04-07‎Yet ANOTHER dream where some man tries to shoot me in the face, gahh!
2012-04-07‎@jaelentruong yeah, think they said its coming out in summer.
2012-04-07‎@lifewithnick you certainly are tweeting lots tonight lol
2012-04-07‎If you watch the trailer, watch the restricted version XD
2012-04-07‎I will never look at a teddy bear the same way again after I go see this.
2012-04-07‎Holy shit, Ted looks FUCKIN brilliant!  ;D
2012-04-07‎@dpnh because now everyone has the smart and iPhones. So you'd think it be like the normal browser.
2012-04-07‎@dpnh I never understood the mobile backgrounds. I dont think I ever set one up. Not sure what they even consider mobile, like just a cell?
2012-04-06‎Lucy In the Skyy With Diamonds...Lucy In the Skyiyy With Diamonds...LUCY IN THE SKYYIYYYY WITH DIAMONDS!!!  AHHHHHahhHhh!
2012-04-06‎@LogicallyHank thanks! Somber actually didn't take much effort at all!

2012-04-06‎@dpnh that sucks man!

2012-04-06‎@dpnh you alright Dave?
2012-04-06‎Walking Bruno around outside in the dark and take a branch to the head. Yeah...OUCH!
2012-04-06‎@makemebad35 I am now tempted to go out to taco bell.....if it wasnt over 15 miles away  X(  I fricken LOVE taco bell though!
2012-04-06‎Doesnt matter how old I am, I still find the time to play Banjo-Kazooie now and then lol still have the good 'ol N64.
2012-04-05‎Ohh joyy more car problems. This is like the third time in months I've had issues with it.
2012-04-05‎@dpnh my mom forces me and my bro lol I'm not too keen on then either. But I have to watch when they inject. I'm crazy like that lol
2012-04-05‎@AaronFuckingB I think theres a way to go back farther. I always figure it out on accident.
2012-04-05‎@dpnh I've been really fortunate. Got flu shot too. Hope it's just a passing thing.
2012-04-05‎Makes me nervous because I always get sick around Easter/March. Hope it clears out soon!
2012-04-05‎Ugh allergies are kickin my ass right now. Throats sore & dry and can't pop my ears. Nose ran crazy fishing earlier.
2012-04-05‎@kungfualice that must be a fuckin big ass car!

2012-04-04‎@freakshow180 haha really? I always have to check now and then because some channels close on me. Like one was closed for months, didnt see.
2012-04-04‎@dpnh yeah lol keep forgetting he left youtube. Real shame because I recall his channel got sponsored & everything. Was getting decent views
2012-04-04‎@JWO92911 Thanks. Yeah no rhyme or reason to it. Just got the camera out and went and shot.
2012-04-04‎Serious videos that it. They're a nice switch up from constantly being crazy and loud lol
2012-04-04‎New video out. Very different than the usual - http://t.co/m1TZbKHZ  So might not be everyone's taste but I do enjoy doing vids like these.
2012-04-04‎Will help keep it fresh and moving, even if it is just filler content, seems like the way to go being my 2nd channel has little activity.
2012-04-04‎Think I'm going to start doing a mix on my main channel of vlogs and the skits I do. The 2nd channel will be for extras/bloopers only.
2012-04-04‎@makemebad35 how old is it? that sucks man!
2012-04-04‎@dpnh good 'ol mr crazy.
2012-04-04‎@JWO92911 that I am

2012-04-04‎But will have a video out tomorrow. Very different than the usual stuff but hope you like it.
2012-04-04‎Gonna hold off on the xbox trolling video for another week. Gonna take me a while to get a video-full of reactions.
2012-04-03‎@makemebad35 http://t.co/rz00Qjpe
2012-04-03‎@makemebad35 hear NFL got new uniforms? Not major changes for most of the teams. Fricken seattle is crazy though.
2012-04-03‎Best of luck to @cinemassacre shooting his movie! Craziness it's finally being filmed.
2012-04-03‎@cinemassacre Awesome you finally started shooting! Best of luck to ya!  =)
2012-04-03‎RT @cinemassacre: Day 1 on AVGN set! Let's shoot this fucker! http://t.co/d6L5grsd
2012-04-03‎Okay, who's been rubbing fireworks on my bath towels?!
2012-04-03‎Well filmed a bit of xbox trolling today but ran out of time. didnt get much. gonna take days to shoot this.
2012-04-03‎I swear companies should make albums out of them and sell them, out of the ones that are on youtube these days. They're brilliant!
2012-04-03‎My mind is addicted to video game remixes aghh!
2012-04-02‎Mr. Horse Head Meets Mr. Wooden Alligator quote much? Found this card at CVS lol @makemebad35 http://t.co/SsW46Yso
2012-04-02‎Converse are great and classic but over time my laces started tearing and they just arent durable. Just bought a pair of vans, awesome!
2012-04-02‎Well after wearing converse for a year noticed a big difference with these new shoes I just bought. Surprised I'm not flat footed.
2012-04-02‎One of my neighbors just got robbed the other day, multiple flat screen tv's stolen. That makes me feel real secure right now  =/
2012-04-02‎I'm not even going into details with this one..
2012-04-02‎I swear I take acid after I fall asleep. DREAMS JUST DONT MAKE SENSE!
2012-04-02‎@imatu777 No idea, it was mainly my ops on my blogtv but now have over 60 ops so unsure on the original advisers lol
2012-04-02‎@freakshow180 Because I'm youuuu! We are the same and THAT is how it is!
2012-04-02‎@iFahmi13 get well soon!
2012-04-02‎@PointProd ain't no party like an icbal party, who remembers their old vids now?!
2012-04-02‎@PointProd trust me I'll never forget those videos.
2012-04-02‎uh umm.......WHAT THE FUCK?!?! RT @PioneersProd She though she was eating wooden aligator cock! But it was Mr. Horse Heads pole! She choked!
2012-04-02‎@freakshow180 uh umm.......WHAT THE FUCK?!?!
2012-04-02‎@PointProd how do I not remember you making this twitter?
2012-04-02‎Wow so this is what I get after not being on the computer for six hours, thanks @freakshow180 for the spam! Happy April Fools!
2012-04-02‎@makemebad35 Im surprised alicia didnt make you prestige
2012-04-01‎Dont you go messin' with my Mario mushrooms! http://t.co/bbCc0Ckb
2012-04-01‎I'll have a new video out this Saturday dealing with Xbox, so you all should enjoy this one. Gotta film it Tuesday/Thursday.
2012-04-01‎AND click here for a F#ck montage - http://t.co/bsxveTmy
2012-04-01‎No new video this week but check out this video I did with Jamez - http://t.co/pBXgX27b  A collab where he thinks I'm makemebad35
2012-04-01‎So youtube is in the April Fools spirit already...
2012-04-01‎@freakshow180 April Fools must be your favorite holiday..
2012-04-01‎@dpnh thanks, haven't even had tone to take a look until now lol
2012-03-31‎Just havent had the time to look at it. The fucker takes 12 double A batteries! And one of them leaked battery acid so that was the issue.
2012-03-31‎No more blurry shots in my videos anymore, fixed my monitor. Haven't even gotten to use it in one video yet and got it for christmas.
2012-03-31‎To me, mac and cheese breath is worse than morning breath..
2012-03-31‎@freakshow180 That was the best april fools anyones gotten me with
2012-03-31‎@freakshow180 April fools much?
2012-03-31‎@freakshow180 Thats an eerie coincidence being you have a redneck roommate!
2012-03-31‎@makemebad35 What do you mean you cant put them on? They don't show up on the card? Or they're like invalid when you go to import.
2012-03-31‎@freakshow180 Sounds just like you haha yous trollin!
2012-03-31‎@freakshow180 You douchebag! IT'S YOU!
2012-03-31‎@freakshow180 They're just pics really. They make no sense!
2012-03-31‎@freakshow180 http://t.co/KwDRm3ZF - Wtf? That guy's been sending me video responses.
2012-03-31‎@freakshow180 probably the worst nfl draft bust in history
2012-03-31‎Ryan Leaf was arrested? Oh my fucking god...
2012-03-31‎@dpnh Which isnt difficult so I'll look into it!
2012-03-31‎@dpnh something like that would be my best bet since it doesn't open into a folder with clips, it opens like an actual dvd. So would rip it.
2012-03-31‎So if I can somehow manage to rip the footage I'll be in business for supermarket stuff!
2012-03-31‎The reason I also brought that old camera up earlier is because I can use it as a benefit for public videos because it has a mic port.
2012-03-31‎@imatu777 I'll look into it though!
2012-03-31‎@imatu777 Well the thing is, it opens the dvd as if it were in a dvd player. There's no folders of clips or anything like normal.
2012-03-30‎And for those who don't know...my 2008 stuff was SHIT
2012-03-30‎I'm interested to see this footage lol
2012-03-30‎Found old discs with very old 2008 footage on there that I used for videos. One is from a trip I went on and (cont) http://t.co/cBbWSxYl
2012-03-30‎The joys of acid burning your hands in your dream and being able to feel it!
2012-03-30‎@dpnh I can't even go a week
2012-03-30‎@lifewithnick PioneersProd
2012-03-30‎YEP, I'm the only one!
2012-03-29‎For some reason, I just...think I can beat the word counter before it hits 0 but I fuckin fail every time!
2012-03-29‎Am I the only one who thinks it would help by typing text faster when the word counter runs low and has very little space left in a tweet?
2012-03-29‎@RandomShadowMan Just dont have the money to spend to book a flight to Florida. Plus would suck going alone.
2012-03-29‎@RandomShadowMan Well I'm up in PA & can't afford to miss college. But only would go to a gathering if it were around here 4 the time being.
2012-03-29‎@RandomShadowMan Crazy, a few of my viewers were at playlist live. Guess it goes to show lots of lower ranked people do go to these events!
2012-03-29‎@dpnh Jealous!
2012-03-29‎@makemebad35 I think you said? That was a good vid too.
2012-03-29‎@makemebad35 damn man Im sorry! That must really suck after shooting there for days.
2012-03-29‎@freakshow180 lmao at the last tweet
2012-03-29‎@JWO92911 haha I know my autocorrect took over
2012-03-29‎Game chat is loud and clear but I'm quieter. Just gotta amplify in editing which is no big deal.
2012-03-29‎Wow thanks autocorrect, I just butchered that last tweet
2012-03-29‎So just tested it out and turned out great! Just need to an amplify my voice in editing. Weird, game chats loud SNF clear but I'm quieter.
2012-03-28‎@FNC better than that thing you had to copy for that guy as a librarian!  =P
2012-03-28‎The quality will be a little fuzzy since I dont have a fancy HD capture card but thats fine. Cant believe this worked!
2012-03-28‎Had to go out and buy audio splitters but lucked out using a DVD player for a capture card!
2012-03-28‎Well it was a messy operation but think I finally figured it out. Going to be doing an Xbox video series where I troll other gamers.
2012-03-28‎"""Toe Cramps Suck!"" - New 2nd channel video! - http://t.co/Z4RmK53U"
2012-03-28‎This should be a great new additional series to my videos. Just need to buy a capture card. I think you know where Im going with this.
2012-03-28‎@JWO92911 It's fine when that happens to me, I pretty much like any burger supreme except for mustard.
2012-03-28‎So been over a year now since I bought my iMac. Time flies! Still the best purchase I've ever made.
2012-03-28‎God that was just torture. Never in my life has a cramp lasted 12 minutes!
2012-03-28‎@JWO92911 Fuck....NO! Lol
2012-03-28‎@Taylorisanugget I was the entire time haha so gross!
2012-03-28‎RT @JWO92911: @PioneersProd chop it off...just make sure u record it for ur next vid
2012-03-28‎Man...finally pretty much fizzled out. My god. Im used to toe cramps lasting 20-30 seconds at most let alone TWELVE MINUTES!
2012-03-28‎GOD! I've had a toe cramp the past 10 mins and won't go away, wtf do I do?!??
2012-03-28‎Just got a great idea for a new series of videos....but I need to get some cables and splitters first.
2012-03-28‎Thanks for those who came to the live chat. It was fun! Getting on mw3 soon, add me if you play! PioneersProd
2012-03-27‎Live blogtv show for a bit, come in and chat! - http://t.co/4DCnPIOx

2012-03-27‎@MirroredTheory Question Jake, how would I credit you if I used your music in a video? I'm a youtube partner.
2012-03-27‎I am addicted to hot ham and cheese.
2012-03-26‎Okay you know what? I'm going to make a fuckin sandwich and call those campers I just played a bitch

2012-03-26‎@freakshow180 right you are!
2012-03-26‎RT @freakshow180: @PioneersProd It's a Friday Night Cranks reference, right?
2012-03-26‎Okay well thank god no guys answered yes lol 12-6=6 cloud refers to cloud 9 so 69 yes or no. @FNC reference

2012-03-25‎@freakshow180 sad thing is I vaguely remember what you said when you ran in our room. It was a speech worth a 1000 words I'll never forget
2012-03-25‎@freakshow180 I dont even remember who took that picture of us. All I remember was it was at Hard Rock Cafe.
2012-03-25‎I have not ONE single ordinary status update in there. What happened to G+?!
2012-03-25‎Okayyy what the fuck? How is it possible that my ENTIRE google+ stream is full of nothing but videos, pics, and news stories?!
2012-03-25‎@Suckerlove23 thats priceless!  XD
2012-03-25‎@freakshow180 the one on the lock-in dvd is priceless. I hardly remember taking it. I have the most fake smile in my life.

2012-03-20‎@JigsawdeadPage Just depends what you edit with. I edit on a mac so it will be a mov file.
2012-03-20‎@JigsawdeadPage Just need your email, I use a online transfer site and it sends to you. Youll get a download link.

2012-03-19‎Im shocked that people at my work watch my videos.
2012-03-18‎It's still so strange that it's been near 70 all week here and is going to stay that way this is. It's fucking MARCH! Awesomeness  =D

2012-03-18‎@makemebad35 sorry missed you man. must have been right when I went to bed.
2012-03-18‎@AaronFuckingB especially sucks since I have so many bot accounts following me. Used to know the true follower count. Gotta be less than 100
2012-03-18‎@AaronFuckingB my Facebook is way more populated than my twitter. Used to get lots of at replies but as years go on I get less and less here
2012-03-18‎@AaronFuckingB what??! Noo!

2012-03-16‎@89Kris In the most serious of times, like just eating a quiet dinner with the family I almost start cracking up at the most random things.
2012-03-16‎Been making sort of a hit list for those videos lol already got four written down. Been 2 months since I made one so figure I'd get writing!
2012-03-16‎@freakshow180 very funny  =P

2012-03-14‎I dont see why people are making such a big deal about this spiel with AVGN pulling a video a few days back (Mike, not James).
2012-03-14‎I forgot how quiet it gets when the coal burner is turned off.
2012-03-14‎@TheArchfiend You got me on that weird part of YouTube again..

2012-03-13‎@freakshow180 I've been wanting to try that!
2012-03-12‎@makemebad35 What the heck? Why'd that just appear in my stream? That brandtflakeshey. It doesn't exist  =X
2012-03-12‎@89Kris happy three years!
2012-03-12‎How Is It Possible Bloopers out on the 2nd channel! - http://t.co/WZ30MpkF
2012-03-12‎Especially video game metal remixes. Those fucking kick ass!
2012-03-12‎I've made quite a few medleys. Interesting what you can do!
2012-03-12‎I love playing around with music with garage band or audacity and sticking together different clips just to see what I can make.
2012-03-12‎@livinginthenorm yeah I've seen it already. Won't outdo 3 but most likely will buy it when it comes out.
2012-03-12‎@gamezdeluna I know. Only two months left though!
2012-03-12‎Why couldn't spring break have been this week? Going to get over 60 all week. Come on!
2012-03-12‎@89Kris yeah mine just ended as well. Ah well. Two more months till summer break!
2012-03-12‎Ohh spring break, you were great. I don't want to go back to the grind tomorrow...ughh!
2012-03-12‎@freakshow180 hmm..weird. I don't know..
2012-03-12‎@freakshow180 Really? I think mine autoplays even if I dont have that on. The ads make it.
2012-03-12‎@livinginthenorm Really? Looks the same to me? Maybe because I put another up for a second but took it down. Looked similar.

2012-03-10‎@TXBrad and this is normal. My dreams have never made sense. I enjoy tweeting and using them in videos too lol
2012-03-10‎which morphed into me racing to eat a line of ice cream and I won....yes this is all normal to me.
2012-03-10‎Which morphed into me scraping off a mass amount of spaghetti sauce out of my car
2012-03-10‎So I dreamed I was at JFK's viewing in my grandma's living room and he kept waking up and smiling at me, and actually got up and left.
2012-03-10‎@makemebad35 I was a bit confused when you said you were putting music on. Kind of depletes the classic makemebad feel.Looking forward 2 it!
2012-03-10‎@freakshow180 lol not much to change us there? Pisses me off you can't choose color pallets for cosmic panda.
2012-03-10‎@CrazyTechDude I use the t2i. Nice camera.

2012-03-09‎@rubennn____ I'm surprised how many people actually liked that one haha good!
2012-03-09‎@CrazyTechDude Idk what youtube was thinking. There's also a box for banner height.
2012-03-09‎@CrazyTechDude You have to make your background and banner one image. It's so stupid. I couldn't even image map it.
2012-03-09‎"New video out! ""How Is It Possible?!"" - http://t.co/j7vtPOsM"
2012-03-09‎It's early but uploading the new video now. Should be out in an hour.
2012-03-09‎@rubennn____ but it's like all the fricken time, makes no sense!
2012-03-09‎@89Kris they never have made sense. i just don't know what makes my mind think those crazy things while i'm out cold lol
2012-03-09‎RT @89Kris: @PioneersProd ... ... ... I'm not touching that with an 80ft pole :P XD
2012-03-09‎@MysteryGuitarM I say both without thinking about it.
2012-03-09‎The other night I dreamed I was taking a biology test in my basement, in my boxers, which morphed into me being digested inside someone. WTF
2012-03-09‎I often wonder if mw3 alters my mind before I sleep lol
2012-03-09‎Ohh boyy, what am I going to dream about tonight? Last night it was about my bro shoving dead owls and chipmunks in his bed. What next?!
2012-03-09‎Edited for the past 6 hours and filmed for about four today. Im tiredsville..

2012-03-08‎@dpnh I dont know haha I was talking to myself saying something's bullshit and noticed it slid in way too easily. Checked and it disappeared
2012-03-08‎Great, just slid my SD card in the CD slot on my iMac. Just great. Somehow got it out sliding a thin pin in there. Fuck me..
2012-03-08‎Spent all day shooting the new video. Should turn out pretty good. Lots of editing ahead of me though..
2012-03-08‎miles of us. But still, only 150ft long? It's not like it's thousands of feet. But still can be catastrophic I guess.
2012-03-08‎"People are freaking out about an asteroid that ""won't"" hit Earth in February 2013. NASA says it's a 150ft asteroid that will come within 17k"
2012-03-08‎And most of all, the comments are buried behind the layers of the channel. It's awful.
2012-03-08‎Yet all of the top channels like smosh and such are image mapped on their channels, wtfff?!
2012-03-08‎grinds my gears is the partner banners. I cant image map it. I've tried multiple sites weeks ago and tonight and still nothing.
2012-03-08‎I hate this layout mostly because of how cluttered it is. I don't mind the enlarged thumbnails on the channels for videos but
2012-03-08‎@makemebad35 You have to make your banner AND background one image and map it. What were they thinking?! No browse for banner box.
2012-03-08‎@makemebad35 I can't even get the image mapping to work on the banner. It sucks. Tried different sites too.
2012-03-08‎So new the layout has taken over, ohhh jooyyy!
2012-03-08‎RT @makemebad35: Now this, is a commercial done right. http://t.co/aT1Wkb0a
2012-03-07‎Suckers http://t.co/Xq3A1pg7
2012-03-07‎I just screencaptured my channel to remember in the future the old layout.
2012-03-07‎Because today's the big day when they convert.
2012-03-07‎Anyone been switched over to the new design on YouTube yet (by force)? Still waiting on mine.
2012-03-07‎@gamezdeluna Funny I found about three fruit loops from that video today under the coffee table and couch. Been a week since I did the vid.
2012-03-07‎@makemebad35 yeah, I watched it today. And signed the petition. Craziness. Hopefully the US can arrest this madman.
2012-03-07‎#StopKony - http://t.co/VfCcJh5q  I know this is going around everywhere but make your voices heard!

2012-03-06‎@freakshow180 I did. Forgot that was a Kubrick film. Most likely will look into Clockwork Orange or Full Metal Jacket.
2012-03-06‎@Oldgregg2247 yeah I keep getting referred to that one. Have to look into it!
2012-03-06‎What are some good Stanley Kubrick films that you would recommend (besides the Shining).
2012-03-06‎Well my video didn't go so well. Public videos are tough for sure. James' turned out alright but I will have to rewrite later.
2012-03-06‎@Suckerlove23 it's the best!
2012-03-06‎Shooting a fun video today with @freakshow180's help. Hopefully it turns out!

2012-02-19‎@hawk4444 Well IDK if youtube still has it but it would say how many percent published the video was. A lot of time it used to say 0%.

2012-02-17‎Though shit happens a lot here, we did come together this past week and shed light on something tragic. I'm proud of us.

2012-02-11‎Found the issue. Got to make it part of your background. That's stupid.
2012-02-11‎@dpnh Dont think it's a glitch. It's like that for both of my channels. Guess I'll look up some videos.
2012-02-11‎The only banner I can post is a video page banner. And I know for a fact my second channel IS partnered because I had a banner before.
2012-02-11‎I still don't understand why with Cosmic Panda I can't upload a channel banner like other partners that use it. What the heck?
2012-02-11‎@TXBrad Just saw daves video but I dont think youre a bad person at all, man. Things happen with friendships.
2012-02-11‎Guess I'll be uploading overnight. Hope everyone has a great weekend!
2012-02-11‎I was going to post a second channel vlog since it's been so long but it's been taking hours to upload, slowing my internet down.
2012-02-11‎@imatu777 Curious, do you still have the old folder of my old videos?
2012-02-11‎@freakshow180 After giving it time it's not too bad. Still getting used to it.
2012-02-10‎YeeeaAaAhHahhh! Toe cramp!! All five toes FUCKARONI!
2012-02-10‎Oh well, let's get this Friday over with!
2012-02-10‎I've already overslept once  =X  And the one time my iPod alarm didnt go off. Sleep just feels so good!
2012-02-10‎Gosh my alarm clock is really starting to make me nervous. I swear I never remember turning my alarms off when they go off sometimes.
2012-02-10‎Ohh Xbox why are you so addictive that I can never sleep?!
2012-02-10‎surprisingly it's real. Most I've seen are over $130+ so very awesome.
2012-02-10‎I had just bought a box set (mono box set) for $80 on amazon from somebody and have been carefully inspecting it b/c of counterfits but
2012-02-10‎@freakshow180 My dad always looks at me like Im crazy when I say I prefer mono. Some have missing parts though like harmonicas though, sucks
2012-02-10‎@freakshow180 Always has a few though better in stereo (lucy in the sky with diamonds is a prime example)
2012-02-10‎@freakshow180 But Sgt Pepper in mono is great. So much better than the stereo.
2012-02-10‎@freakshow180 huge difference. I still prefer their mono tracks over stereo. Especially the older songs, sound clearer.
2012-02-10‎@freakshow180 Problem was I always used to download off of youtube and the quality was always worse, until I bought the remaster box set.
2012-02-10‎Man I never gave Rubber Soul and Revolver much listening before and man I've missed out. Great albums. Tied with Sgt Pepper for favorite.
2012-02-10‎@SmoshIan I just got it yesterday
2012-02-10‎@freakshow180 oh dear haha
2012-02-09‎@livinginthenorm I kinda double taked for a moment and thought, should I really tweet that haha
2012-02-09‎@livinginthenorm Whenever YOU smile I smile  =D.......=X
2012-02-09‎I feel like...smiling?  =P http://t.co/lwsibDf0
2012-02-09‎@DustyTymes NO!

2012-02-09‎Ive been almost late plenty of times waiting for ice/snow to defrost off of my windshielf and then...it dawned on me. POUR HOT WATER ON IT!
2012-02-09‎@MysteryGuitarM that's insane yo!
2012-02-09‎@wafflefuck I'm...wearing crocs right now....but just as fuzzy slippers! I'm not a douche! Lol
2012-02-09‎@DustyTymes wait, what?
2012-02-09‎@MysteryGuitarM damn!
2012-02-09‎@JWO92911 glad you like my videos =) I have so many dead subs though. I probably really have 2000 subscribers.
2012-02-09‎@makemebad35 so imagine all inactive channels will be available again.
2012-02-09‎@CrazyTechDude like accounts not logged into for five years
2012-02-09‎@JWO92911 I got about 350 falling off, I expected thousands!
2012-02-09‎@makemebad35 had a blog post on it. All inactive and closed accounts removed tomorrow. Even my terminated ones are still inactive.
2012-02-09‎So @YouTube is finally cleaning out dead subs tomorrow, w00t!
2012-02-09‎RT @CrazyTechDude: NOTE TO SELF -- When tomorrow comes around, dont freak out that you lost ALOT of subscribers
2012-02-09‎@yosoyian yeah I mean once in a while isn't bad but it's just gotten ridiculous
2012-02-09‎@CrazyTechDude yeah they pushed it back to tomorrow. Will be nice to know the true sub count.
2012-02-09‎@freakshow180 I don't get them as often as I used to. The old bulletins I think had something to do with it.
2012-02-09‎If you hate that too RT...see what I did there ;)
2012-02-09‎I swear almost every other tweet has RT in it gahh!
2012-02-09‎Idk why but seeing RT if you... or if you do... RT just pisses me off lol I follow a prime example, smosh.
2012-02-08‎@muscleryan lol well glad you're back!
2012-02-08‎@FNC yeah that's gotta burn! Hope you weren't wearing contacts.
2012-02-08‎@CrazyTechDude sorry to hear that man, hope you're well soon!
2012-02-08‎Im sick and tired of smacking my head off this thing! The support beam. http://t.co/8sLsiRAH
2012-02-08‎@muscleryan Where have you been man? Good to have ya back!
2012-02-07‎@DeStorm I dont think I've ever fallen asleep on my keyboard.
2012-02-07‎@JWO92911 yeah idk, everyone's changing their layouts.
2012-02-07‎So YouTube and Twitter are flip flopping layouts. Why do they change things that arent broken?  =X
2012-02-07‎and other tabs at the top of the page.
2012-02-07‎The new twitter layout is crazy. I don't know when they're switching it but it's all backwards. The right module is on the left & at replys
2012-02-07‎@jaelentruong that's awful man, hope you get well fast!
2012-02-07‎@89Kris yeah I know a lot who have ps3, I stopped after ps2
2012-02-07‎Anyone new have Xbox Live? Add me, my gamertag's PioneersProd
2012-02-07‎@livinginthenorm a new layout? Again??
2012-02-07‎@YTCreators nice, I'll finally know my true subscriber count.
2012-02-07‎RT @YTCreators: Closed accounts will be removed from channel sub counts Thurs (2/9), you'll see a one-time sub count adjustment http://t ...
2012-02-07‎@TUMBOMB94 happy birthday! Hope it was great!
2012-02-06‎"""The day after the #SuperBowl should be a holiday so I could sleep in"", I still see posts like this lol"
2012-02-06‎@kurt13warner you guys shouldve beat the Steelers three years ago
2012-02-06‎@freakshow180 I'll pass lol
2012-02-06‎@makemebad35 More important though, the real question is PEYTON or ELI
2012-02-06‎@makemebad35 but man, Eli still stuns me.
2012-02-06‎@makemebad35 Every time the giants are on the verge of losing they somehow win the game, I still cant believe it. It was a close finish
2012-02-06‎@KristinRoseFNC I wish  =(
2012-02-06‎But I will admit that Giants team is incredible. Eli is on his way to being a Tom Brady.
2012-02-06‎That is one of those super bowls where it feels ugly in the end, not just because NY won.
2012-02-06‎Well that last five minutes was crazy ahhh shit...
2012-02-06‎Well here we go, the drive(s) we've been waiting for
2012-02-06‎Come on let's see a big play. There's been none really all game besides that safety.
2012-02-06‎@yosoyian nothing big has happened all game
2012-02-06‎@smoshanthony you'd only be $46 richer if you cared for all of them
2012-02-06‎@jaelentruong gonna be close!
2012-02-06‎RT @daneboe: I'm watching this thing called the Super Bowl. Anyone else watching? It's pretty cool. I wonder if it will catch on.
2012-02-06‎@makemebad35 lmao Well gonna be a close finish!
2012-02-06‎@livinginthenorm Back in 2004
2012-02-06‎@livinginthenorm I was only 11 lol what eleven year old wouldnt want to see that?
2012-02-06‎@FNC Ironic, the ONE time that night I stopped the tape and I missed it. I always tape the game AND halftime but that game.
2012-02-06‎@FNC I never watch halftime. The only time I wish I did was in Super Bowl XXXVIII when Janet Jackson's wardrobe was ripped off.
2012-02-06‎RT @FNC: I Am disappointed in every single person who thought this was a good idea / thinks this is music
2012-02-06‎The past five years the team I've wanted to win only won once (Packers over PIT). But before that, 4-2 (TB over OAK and STL over TEN).
2012-02-06‎Oh well, just want to see a great football game  =D
2012-02-06‎"I'm one of the few people I know that actually doesn't mind the Pats. Guess people are sick of them winning and ""cheating""."
2012-02-06‎I can't stand the Giants but would be rooting for NE no matter what, even if SF or GB got in.
2012-02-06‎@makemebad35 What?! Thought you were rooting for the Pats yesterday haha
2012-02-06‎Here come the Patriots! #SuperBowl
2012-02-05‎Come on Patriots, wake up out there!
2012-02-05‎@livinginthenorm not possible in postseason
2012-02-05‎NE wins it in last second field goal, calling it.
2012-02-05‎@freakshow180 NO!
2012-02-05‎Wanted to shoot myself in the foot for missing Theismann and Plunkett. Got 41/45 right.
2012-02-05‎Can you name every #SuperBowl winning quarterback in 6 minutes? - http://t.co/LaIgcUA5

2012-02-03‎@freakshow180 I know, Fred fell off when he started doing music videos and high budget material.
2012-02-03‎"@freakshow180 Wasnt saying I ""liked"" it. Saying it wasn't bad, for a kid like Fred anyways. His nose is weird though lol"
2012-02-02‎@makemebad35 But Im not a fan of his videos.
2012-02-02‎@makemebad35 yeah lol I havent watched him in years but noticed he lost a shitload of views. The animation isnt horrible though.
2012-02-02‎Was working on a different video but it wasn't turning out the way I'd hoped so decided to finally edit together the Alligator bloopers.

2012-02-01‎I did enjoy doing it though, so will be one clip in the new video.
2012-02-01‎Well watched over the footage and didnt get many reactions. Got one but that was it. Gotta be louder but there were kids all around.

2012-01-31‎Have to see in editing. Thankfully that isnt the entire video. Just for a portion.
2012-01-31‎Shot in there for about a half hour but the flip just sucks. The shots might not be wide enough and my top half might be missing.
2012-01-31‎Just  shot some stuff at a supermarket for the new video but the cart might be blocking some of the frame ughh
2012-01-31‎@RickiGoesRwarr followed
2012-01-31‎@RickiGoesRwarr computer it looks different.

2012-01-22‎WE ARE PENN STATE!
2012-01-22‎Also whats a let down is I'm only an hour or so away from PSU (State College). Never once went to a game.

2012-01-22‎@dpnh how have you been Dave? Feel like I haven't talked to you in a while.
2012-01-22‎@DustyTymes idk I think it makes their earlier stuff clearer and there's no echo. Don't like the split channels. But that's what it is 2day
2012-01-21‎Well took advantage of the snow and went toboggoning and smacked my head multiple times trying to snow surf down the hill.

2012-01-20‎I swear there's some magical force that makes it feel as if your phone's vibrating in your pocket. Only when I wear my kahky work pants.
2012-01-20‎The funny thing is though, the guy in those videos had additional tapes we did. I don't have them and doubt he still does but jeez lol

2012-01-19‎I didnt purposely eat it lol didnt notice until the last few bites and looked down, saw green. Ugh.
2012-01-19‎@dpnh Didn't notice until the last few bites. Noticed it tasted funky, looked down and saw green.
2012-01-19‎It was some damn good bread until it tasted like....well...mold! Had to spit it out of the car lol
2012-01-19‎A bite of moldy bread to start the day XP
2012-01-19‎@ROLFFilms I don't get on much though but you can add me on that one
2012-01-19‎@ROLFFilms I made a new one, well technically found my old one, pioneersprod

2012-01-19‎@Ricketts4644 They change things that arent broken, that's the problem. Each one sucks harder and harder.
2012-01-19‎@Ricketts4644 It's too much of a mess. Plus the comments are burried in the layout.
2012-01-19‎Great, so YouTube is switching all channels over to Cosmic Panda on March 1st. FUCK!
2012-01-18‎Multiple clips from different tapes. Have about 12 tapes.
2012-01-18‎I'll upload this tomorrow. It's 23 mins long so unless you're REALLY interested in these, I don't expect many to watch it fully haha
2012-01-18‎My Philosophy professor loves to say fuck a lot. We'll get along fine =)

2012-01-18‎@freakshow180 I had to take it again because I got a D.
2012-01-18‎You guys will never look at me the same way again. You thought the old 2008 videos were bad, these are 4 years earlier!
2012-01-18‎@nnaatteeks IDK still recording some of the old footage.
2012-01-18‎This is 2004 stuff. And yes, I did do videos before YouTube.
2012-01-18‎This next video is a huge ass blast from the past. Recorded some old footage from MIDDLE SCHOOL and edited together some parts.
2012-01-18‎Two of my classes made us all stand up and introduce ourselves. I havent done that since gradeschool, wtf? They both happened to be biology.
2012-01-18‎I just love the feezing wind blowing in my face on campus. Definitely wakes you up.
2012-01-18‎@hawk4444 Anytime man.
2012-01-17‎@dpnh Well bottom line is I get out earlier than last semester. Go in earlier yeah but works out.
2012-01-17‎Back at the good ol college now and EARLY. Most of my first classes are at 8 which sucks. Only two classes today though.
2012-01-17‎Wishing @kungfualice well on her first day of her job!

2012-01-16‎@DustyTymes Monday's arent at 8 lol they're at 10. Bio is probably the hardest class I have right now. Had a hard time last semester.
2012-01-16‎Last semester we had a flood which led to no electricity & water the first day and now it's all this.
2012-01-16‎My 8am class, joyyyy!

2012-01-16‎Back at the good ol' college tomorrow.
2012-01-16‎@freakshow180 I stopped just before they changed they switched the new new My [___] logo. The 2.0 layout was perfect.
2012-01-16‎@kungfualice Forgot to tell you last night, good luck tomorrow for your first day! Hope it goes well!
2012-01-16‎Is it Spring yet?
2012-01-16‎@makemebad35 Im in trouble. Sf and Dallas have 5 super bowl wins, and the giants are in there. Really hoping for BAL.
2012-01-16‎So Green Bay blew it. Think they've never lost a home playoff game.
2012-01-15‎@jfra I don't have anything against the Texans at all. Just prefer Baltimore. Now if it was PIT vs HOU, HOU all the way!
2012-01-15‎Classic Bruno haha http://t.co/xyOE8S8J
2012-01-15‎@osumnick not easy being a Dallas fan here haha
2012-01-15‎@osumnick for PIT though, they've always won. PITs my 2nd least fav team.
2012-01-15‎@osumnick They best thing NE has done for me, beat PHI in SB XXXIX. Was so nervous for that game, living here in PA. Can't say the same
2012-01-15‎can't stand the giants and SF has 5 super bowls already. Just gotta hope AFC wins the super bowl.
2012-01-15‎So bottom line, I can care less who makes it to the Super Bowl in the AFC (preferably the Ravens), but NFC I gotta hope for GB. Hate GB but
2012-01-15‎@osumnick I'm one of the only guys I know that doesn't mind NE. Guess everyone's sick of them winning..
2012-01-15‎@yosoyian I don't mind the Texans at all. I just prefer the Ravens. Actually saw Dallas play the Texans a few years back.
2012-01-15‎Alright Ravens time to shine. Want them in the Super Bowl.
2012-01-15‎Why cant i SLEEP?!?!
2012-01-15‎Tebow time is done time
2012-01-15‎Here you go Tebow, gotta pull the biggest comeback in your career to beat NE. Not going to happen.
2012-01-15‎You gotta be kidding. I gotta see these highlights when i get home.
2012-01-15‎JEEEZ! How did SF win?! Nooo!
2012-01-15‎Afc anyone. Hoping the Ravens get there.
2012-01-15‎Can NOT have SF or NY in the super bowl. Sf & Dallas both have 5 super bowl wins. I dont like GB either. gotta hope for New Orleans for Nfc
2012-01-15‎Come on Saints, knock of SF. Cant see the game but shocked they came back down 17-0!
2012-01-14‎@FNC Man Jared I'm so glad you showed video for the George prank, your facial expressions, PRICELESS. I must've watched that prank 50 times.
2012-01-14‎@FNC dude I am in tears laughing even after I saw it LIVE! Only caught the 2nd call but man. Wrong to laughter but you can't script that!
2012-01-14‎RT @FNC: The new video is up now! text got all weird but thats okay :D Share this link all around... http://t.co/pvm76dGU

2012-01-13‎Ice on my windshield fuck off!
2012-01-13‎@freakshow180 for his mail video haha
2012-01-13‎@nnaatteeks I don't know haha
2012-01-13‎And this random crap is on a nightly basis. My dreams have NEVER..EVER made sense. It shows in my videos at times the stuff I write.
2012-01-13‎And then randomly I was a blue bird. OKAY!
2012-01-13‎Just a typical night's sleep...
2012-01-13‎The professor had the class do a Q&A video and Damian sends one (which...you can imagine) and then that morphed into MW3 public trolling...
2012-01-13‎and then it morphed me into a college class, which I had to repeat and makemebad35 was supposedly in another one of the professor's classes
2012-01-13‎Started off with my on the computer and a big ass bug with white/red spotted 10 inch wings was right next to my keyboard (I hate bugs)
2012-01-13‎Good god the dreams I have...
2012-01-13‎@freakshow180 You only lost around 25-30
2012-01-13‎@CrazyTechDude Most are bots/spam accounts which suck. Every other day I get spam replies.
2012-01-13‎@CrazyTechDude to 15%. I know for a fact I don't really have 534.
2012-01-13‎@CrazyTechDude I don't even know how many followers I have. It always increases and decreases. I maybe only get tweets/at replys from 10%
2012-01-13‎@FNC The top partners seem to be the most affected. Like RayWJ, nigahiga, makemebad35. They lost from 30k - over 100k
2012-01-13‎@smoshanthony How do you do that? Taco's usually aren't that hard..
2012-01-13‎@freakshow180 all 600 of yours.
2012-01-13‎@freakshow180 Some kind of glitch on vidstats. Shows the total subs they had and shows that they lost THAT many. So you didnt really lose
2012-01-13‎According to vidstats that is. Hasn't shown on my channel yet.
2012-01-13‎Well so far looks like I lost 348 subscribers from the clean up. Not bad. I expected thousands.
2012-01-12‎@makemebad35 I thought spiders was the biggest issue, now video game violence?
2012-01-12‎@livinginthenorm Yeah just read it, strange. Guess they didn't put enough thought into it or something.
2012-01-12‎So they're moving it to tomorrow?
2012-01-12‎So it was postponed? Strange. They make the announcement the other day and changed it already?
2012-01-12‎Anyone have a change in subs today? I'm still unaffected.
2012-01-12‎Cut out the portion about the pedestrian crossing since I felt I went too far with it.
2012-01-12‎"New ""Sucks"" video! ""Traffic Lights"" - http://t.co/XH7c6U6B  Reuploaded, cut out a part since I felt it was a bit harsh"
2012-01-12‎@freakshow180 I want the Child's Play remake already!
2012-01-12‎@hawk4444 I gained quite a lot from the sucks video. Havent lost much at all.
2012-01-12‎Plus takes an hour to fall asleep, grr. Probably the Xbox programs my mind to be awake an extra hour.
2012-01-12‎At times I wish I could wake up around 10:30/11:30 but always ends up after 12.
2012-01-12‎I stay up this late and then can't wake up the next day AND can't fall asleep now, sleep you are a nuisance right now...
2012-01-12‎*of one
2012-01-12‎If there's only one thing I hate about mw3 it's that it puts me in random matches. Like just now connected to the end if one. Wtf COD?
2012-01-12‎@yosoyian their apple pies are amazing
2012-01-12‎@yosoyian they always manage to screw up something lol
2012-01-12‎@makemebad35 it is cool that they have that site though.
2012-01-12‎@makemebad35 not often but did notice a few weeks back I'd lose like 6 subs a day. Since the midnight video though I haven't lost much.
2012-01-12‎@livinginthenorm and that's fine. I want it to be accurate and not have thousands of dead accounts in there.
2012-01-12‎@livinginthenorm Oh really? Yeah I'm going to do a comparison. I expect a huge drop for me.
2012-01-12‎@freakshow180 I'm freezing even at home. I'm sitting on a recliner with a blanket and crocs. Also think I might be getting sick  =X
2012-01-12‎Everyone should take a screencap of their sub count and compare it to tomorrows. Guarantee I lose 5000 subs...
2012-01-11‎RT @TheArchfiend: I uploaded a @YouTube video http://t.co/2tETI7hp The Purge Cometh Tomorrow!  YouTube Will FINALLY Delete Junk
2012-01-11‎@sonicfreak04 That's always happened to me. Even nowadays.
2012-01-11‎It's done it since pretty much when I got it last April. Wtf? That goes for any game on any site.
2012-01-11‎increase/decrease volume it's inaudible. I have to put the computer on Sleep mode and wake it up for the sound to come back on.
2012-01-11‎Anyone else with a Mac go to play a game on say, VNES and the sound to the entire computer shuts off. Even hitting the
2012-01-11‎to the Horse Head Lives but with a comedic side to it as well. I do like doing serious videos with darker lighting from time to time.

2012-01-11‎@kungfualice Wow, congrats! That was pretty damn fast.
2012-01-11‎@freakshow180 A DSLR? That's what I use.
2012-01-11‎@freakshow180 Watch they wont remove any of RWJ's
2012-01-11‎I got a date with a big bowl of soupie!
2012-01-11‎My throat feels awful today. Praying it's just because it's dry here (low humidity). Really do not want to get sick now.
2012-01-11‎@makemebad35 you other hand, jeez..
2012-01-11‎@makemebad35 Wow so they really are doing it? haha oh boy, I'll probably lose 5000 subs  =X
2012-01-11‎@Suckerlove23 Strange, I just had mine sent in with problems. It sucks. This is like the fifth time in the past year.
2012-01-11‎@livinginthenorm If I ever had to change my username, I have no idea what it would be. I've only really had a couple since middle school.

2012-01-09‎@makemebad35 Had fun playing Xbox with you guys, even if it was just one game. Still learning here too haha
2012-01-09‎If I was still in high school I'd sport a Tebow jersey to school tomorrow. Denver should've got killed tonight.
2012-01-09‎I hate PIT so much so an awesome feeling.
2012-01-09‎Well I wasnt home to see it but thank you Tim Tebow, the one time I rooted for ya woo!
2012-01-08‎@GBeFearless Insulted me? How? I'm confused lol
2012-01-08‎Had iMovie for almost a year.
2012-01-08‎Saying it's just iMovie redone and such. I know how expensive these programs are though. But wanted to get into learning Final Cut.
2012-01-08‎Anyone edit with Final Cut Pro X here? Or both the version previous? I was looking up Pro X videos and saw lots of bad reviews.
2012-01-08‎Gotta hope the Falcons and Broncos win today. So far Atlanta up 2-0.
2012-01-08‎@kungfualice huge congrats on graduating, Alicia! Thought you did earlier but anyways very awesome!
2012-01-08‎Aaannd that's all she wrote. They haven't won a playoff game since I think the late 90s.
2012-01-08‎Well looks like the curse of Bobby Layne is still in effect for the Lions haha poor Detroit man,still 7 mins left but wanted to see them win
2012-01-08‎@yosoyian SHIT spoke too soon!
2012-01-08‎@yosoyian I'd like the see the Lions win one for a change. They're due. Heck throw them in the Super Bowl. All the hell they've been through
2012-01-08‎@yosoyian It will be tough. They needed that INT there a few plays ago. Not looking too good but still lots of time left.
2012-01-08‎@freakshow180 and you go back tomorrow? I still have another week. Well good luck this semester  =)
2012-01-08‎@freakshow180 I'd kill for one in town but got to drive all the way to the mall to get it. Get rid of the AT&T and throw in Taco Bell lol
2012-01-08‎Alright Lions time to shine! Down ten with a little under ten to go.
2012-01-08‎Taco bell's probably my favorite fast food restaurant, even over fricken McDonald's, and that's saying something lol
2012-01-08‎I fricken love Taco Bell.

2012-01-05‎@CrazyTechDude That's the worst. Well good luck to you. You should write them down somewhere.
2012-01-05‎@nnaatteeks A year or so and get into Final Cut.

2012-01-05‎I had lots of email addresses lol
2012-01-05‎Not sure how many people even still use email these days. It's all Facebook and such now for communication.
2012-01-05‎Man its strange opening an email account you havent used in over two years. Just looking at the contacts that were on your list at the time.
2012-01-04‎@tylerg2002 So true
2012-01-04‎It's so strange being off this long for college for winter break. Don't go back still for another 13 days.
2012-01-04‎@livinginthenorm Well technically it's impossible to quit skype since accounts cant be deleted  =P
2012-01-03‎@makemebad35 Spiders obviously

2012-01-02‎@kungfualice Ughh looks like we'll have to make big changes for next season. Too many big plays defensively all year.
2012-01-02‎...and the Giants of course, would like them out in a flash.
2012-01-02‎Rooting for everyone in the postseason but Pittsburgh. Like to see the Ravens or Lions get there.
2012-01-02‎@dallascowboys well pressures off but need to make big changes defensively for next year. Too many big plays.
2012-01-02‎Too many wild close games for us this year.

2012-01-02‎Roller coaster season. Well pressures off for now, but I think we'll do better next season. Lots of talent still.
2012-01-02‎Well that was hard to watch. Those damn Giants man. Cruz is a beast. Seasons over. Lots I'd rebuilding to do especially defensively.
2012-01-02‎Ughh not looking good for Dallas, damn you giants. Still another half but down 21-0
2012-01-02‎@livinginthenorm that's not fast food

2011-12-31‎@gamezdeluna I'll always love sequels. REMAKES need to be done away with.
2011-12-31‎Scream 5 might be a go? Sweet! Only thing is Craven might not direct. That would be a crushing blow.

2011-12-29‎Up YouTubers. Why would anyone want to see who you added as a friend in there? Just a waste of space.

2011-12-29‎Ugh so of course my brand new monitor wouldnt work while shooting this video. What the heck?! I gotta look into seeing what the issue is.

2011-12-28‎Might do my first public video soon. Took a walk around the location today and it should work. Only thing is I'd probably have to shoot it
2011-12-28‎@tylerg2002 haha well this is hours after I had the coffee. Funny though, I get all of my ideas after midnight. Weird..

2011-12-23‎My main channel was never switched.
2011-12-23‎In maybe once a month but has around fifteen videos on it.
2011-12-23‎As well as a few others I just happened to look up that aren't used much, that are on my friends list. Because on that account, I only sign
2011-12-23‎So YouTube decided to switch every channel with little activity on it to the new design? One of the accounts I dont use anymore was switched

2011-12-22‎@makemebad35 Yeah that would be a crushing blow. Didnt know you had another camera. Guess Canon would've been too noticeable.
2011-12-22‎@gamezdeluna It seemed to drag a bit but was a good episode. Should've ended it last week. Would've been a good cliffhanger.

2011-12-19‎@BrunoMarsTwin That's what I hate about Philly, they always find ways to win. Dallas always finds ways to lose.
2011-12-19‎Dallas better win out. If they do, Dallas wins the division.
2011-12-19‎I still find it hard to believe that the Eagles can still SOMEHOW win the NFC East if luck goes their way. We have PHI Xmas Eve then NYG.

2011-12-12‎@livinginthenorm I heard TheArchfiend mention it so it most likely is true
2011-12-12‎Close one at the half, come on Dallas lets go!
2011-12-12‎@freakshow180 so glad they're doing it. It needs to be cleaned out. I have thousands of dead subs.

2011-12-11‎@makemebad35 But hey, the Raiders most of all shocked me. I never expected them to respond the way they have and now have a shot at playoffs
2011-12-11‎@makemebad35 roller coaster start. Probably should have started at least 4-1. The DET loss, the Jets loss, even NE was close.
2011-12-11‎@makemebad35 They better not miss because of last week at Arizona. Such a tough loss. They've surprised me this season. Started off on a

2011-12-06‎@freakshow180 Im still surprised they dont let you change channel design colors yet. That's one thing that has stuck with me.
2011-12-06‎@smpfilms if only everyone knew http://t.co/dsnLyOXN gives the old layout
2011-12-06‎@makemebad35 I'm serious man, looked exactly like the quality you'd see on tv! Very impressed! I'd say Towson is paying off =]

2011-12-03‎@Nighty74 Ohhh lol
2011-12-03‎Video will be out late Saturday afternoon!

2011-12-02‎@smpfilms There's only one video that shows at a time. Also no way to post video responses AND cant change channel colors.
2011-12-02‎@makemebad35 Only get 1400 at most for one video. I have thousands of dead subs. Cant imagine your amount.
2011-12-02‎@makemebad35 Jeez! Maybe YouTube is finally clearing out the dead subs, which would be nice. Like for me says I have over 9,600 subs but
2011-12-02‎@makemebad35 From you? My subs have been a roller coaster lately. Gain 2 lose 1, gain 1 lose 3, just strange.
2011-12-02‎How do you even post video responses? They managed to screw that up somehow  =X
2011-12-02‎Sorry for all of the tweets tonight lol

2011-12-02‎@dpnh Wish they could fix is the amount of time it takes to upload a video.Would kill to upload a 720p HD vid in 10 mins instead of 2 hours.
2011-12-02‎@synthplaya box for it. Has banner height and everything but that's screwed up.
2011-12-02‎"@synthplaya Already found flaws in it too. The ""channel"" page banner is now the ""video"" page banner. Says channel page but there's no browse"
2011-12-02‎@dpnh Yeah one of my viewers was commenting on that. Only one video per user in the box now too.
2011-12-02‎@smoshanthony I hate that they only show one video in the sub boxes on the homepage

2011-12-02‎@freakshow180 Well YouTube has changed but has not liked your opinions on what the new design should be.....sadly it's almost just as bad
2011-12-02‎Ah they just now switched my home and video page. Literally right after I just uploaded a new video.
2011-12-02‎@makemebad35 I mean the change is optional now but guarantee it will be forced in a few months time. I cant even get my banner to work yet.
2011-12-02‎@makemebad35 I wish they'd have the option to choose from the original channel design, the 2.0 beta channels, and the cosmic panda.
2011-12-01‎@TheArchfiend Make a video about Cosmic Panda
2011-12-01‎It's a great on its own but not YouTube.
2011-12-01‎@makemebad35 like YouTube anymore with the new layout. Getting used to the beta channels was tough but this is a huge change.
2011-12-01‎@makemebad35 Yeah that's the Cosmic Panda from the TestTube page. I like the enlarged thumbnails and descriptions but it just doesnt seem
2011-12-01‎Nooo! It's Cosmic Pandaa!

2011-10-26‎@dpnh yeah now it's a challenge going live bi-weekly here
2011-10-26‎I think the thing I miss most is southern hospitality down there in Texas. Really wish we had that in the east.
2011-10-26‎@nnaatteeks Money is the big thing though. Didnt spend much this year. State fair killed us though.Very expensive. Always family fun though!
2011-10-26‎@nnaatteeks Instead, so missed out on Texas that year. My dad went with my bro another year before that, so I missed out on two years.
2011-10-26‎@nnaatteeks My long days were TUES/THURS. So I didnt miss much work at all. But a few years ago my parents went on a cruise for their anny
2011-10-26‎@nnaatteeks I dont go every year but mostly. Two of the years I didnt go. Just depends. Especially this year with college but got lucky that
2011-10-26‎@freakshow180 All of them will end around three.
2011-10-26‎@freakshow180 I hate Tues and Thurs, those are my long days. Leaving after 5 is always dreading. At least next semester it's balanced.

2011-10-25‎@freakshow180 90% of the time you cant tell what you're lookin at! His camera just moves all over the place. It's a claustrophobic style.
2011-10-25‎@freakshow180 He went too far in the sequel. Not too fond of his story at all. They should've continued from Halloween Resurrection.
2011-10-25‎@freakshow180 I saw the Rob Zombie ones in theaters and the sequel to his first was dreadful to watch. The stabbing was WAY over the top.
2011-10-25‎@freakshow180 New director and everything. Wont be like Season of the Witch at all.

2011-10-17‎@makemebad35 He's gone about 15 times. Nice to feel warmer weather again and southern hospitality.
2011-10-17‎@makemebad35 Yeah first grade was my first time and went almost every year after that. Mainly because my dad just loves them since a kid.
2011-10-17‎@makemebad35 Hope the Raiders can rally with Boller though. He's kind of a 50:50 QB at times. He's either fairly good or pretty bad.
2011-10-17‎@makemebad35 Should win that game hopefully. Will be fun to see them play again. This is going to be my 9th time going down there  =X
2011-10-17‎@makemebad35 Yeah just caught the highlights. Dallas should be at least 4-1. Im going to the Cowboys/Rams game next weekend though.
2011-10-17‎@freakshow180 Ahh stupid me!
2011-10-17‎Is it true?? Fred closed his account??
2011-10-17‎@freakshow180 I offered you a web cam last year  =X
2011-10-17‎@nnaatteeks Going to be doing it through Facebook from now on. Not a lot of people have a twitter for me. Facebook's easier.
2011-10-16‎@makemebad35 Yeah, raiders are doing well this season, especially Campbell. idk who the backup is.
2011-10-16‎Ughh so Dallas is 2-3, just great. should just be 4-1! I didnt get to see this game but heard Brady threw a TD in final seconds. dammit..
2011-10-16‎@makemebad35 wait, what?? What happened? Im at work. That sucks man  =(
2011-10-16‎Moving #RFFF to Facebook from now on.

2011-10-14‎@makemebad35 that was back around 2009 though. Why are you wondering that though?
2011-10-14‎@makemebad35 I remember sometimes I would see (dare I say it) Fred's new video up right as it hit and it would say  an hour ago
2011-10-14‎@makemebad35 I never pay much attention to that stuff. Seems like it is both at times.

2011-10-08‎@smpfilms What camera do you normally use to shoot your videos?
2011-10-08‎Great so looks like I do gotta save up for a $200 monitor now. The tiny one I was looking at is too fragile and is a messy operation to work
2011-10-08‎@Nighty74 of a messy operation to convert it into a monitor for the camera. Got to take things apart and glue/tape together.
2011-10-08‎@Nighty74 So that idea's out now. Looks like I got to spend $200 now. The little monitor I was looking at would be too fragile and is kind
2011-10-08‎@Nighty74 I had a barrel connector lying around and connected the two yellow (video) cables into it, but it didnt work for some reason.
2011-10-08‎@smpfilms The 5D is a great camera. I just bought a Canon t2i. Loving it so far! 5D is also pretty expensive.

2011-10-01‎@makemebad35 Can you just use any ordinary Transcend 16 GB memory card? That would help save money since I own one already.
2011-10-01‎@makemebad35 but is there a card you need to buy to film on or is it all internally stored?
2011-10-01‎@makemebad35 Sent you a DM regarding Canon.

2011-09-17‎@livinginthenorm In the end, had it narrowed down to four pics, and chose that one. Then took me about an hour or so to edit the banner.
2011-09-17‎@livinginthenorm Going back to the camera and set it up again with the timer. Plus sometimes I was out of frame. It's such a wide shot.
2011-09-17‎@livinginthenorm Took me about 15 minute to snap the pic of me because I couldnt set the camera to take multiple shots. Had to keep
2011-09-17‎@livinginthenorm It's Friday! One class, give me a break  =)

2011-09-11‎Yess! Alright Ravens! The Steelers are getting crushed!
2011-09-11‎@kungfualice I remember I saw the primetime game where his shoulder broke. I knew we were fucked lol
2011-09-11‎My Cowboys take on the Jets tonight which will be a very emotional game. We'll see if Romo can put together a better season than last years.
2011-09-11‎Here's a video on some of the behind the scenes work on Mr. Horse Head Meets Mr. Wooden Alligator 2 - http://t.co/heiRKBE
2011-09-11‎@nnaatteeks Will do!
2011-09-11‎@makemebad35 Praying STL crushes PHI. You have Sunday Ticket?
2011-09-11‎Also my brother's birthday. Just watching the pregames on CBS and FOX made me teary eyed. #911
2011-09-11‎Hard to believe it's been 10 years. I was in 3rd grade when it happened. Always remember 9/11 and live life to the fullest every day #911
2011-09-11‎@makemebad35 that movie even almost gave me nightmares
2011-09-11‎@FNC Holy shit! That's crazy!
2011-09-11‎@abbadiego Yeah this has happened before. Still hate when it happens though! Burning my rubber!
2011-09-11‎@nnaatteeks Seems like Im always a little stuffed up all the time. Dont really know why. Guess that's just how I am.
2011-09-11‎Cats have a grudge against me on the roads for some reason! This is about the third one I've dodged.
2011-09-11‎A cat ran out in front of my car and this was the end result. Burnt some good rubber tonight =/  http://t.co/0NfIuaF
2011-09-10‎I think the change in season's hitting me ealry. runny nose and clogged ears. Noo!
2011-09-10‎@makemebad35 damn, youtube seems to have this glitch a LOT.
2011-09-10‎@makemebad35 maybe b/c I used the custom time uploader
2011-09-10‎@makemebad35 same thing happened when I posted the alligator video. Said 0% for over a day but it was 100%
2011-09-10‎But as soon as I grabbed the flip, he woke up!
2011-09-10‎to see my dog running in his sleep, his feet clipping the metal bottom of the door.
2011-09-10‎haha I just heard this weird clicking noise that lasted a minute or so. I go out in the living room
2011-09-10‎@kungfualice you mean fingerstache  =)
2011-09-10‎@sonicfreak04 Help! I need somebody! Help! Not just anybody! Help! You know I need someone! HeeEeellpp!

2011-09-10‎@muscleryan lmao!
2011-09-10‎@kiersten522 *Not ignoring*  =)
2011-09-09‎@nnaatteeks Mr Horse Head is haunting me already, ohh boy...
2011-09-09‎For the first time in a LONG time I had a nightmare last night. Damn you Chucky for not dying! I beat the shit out of him for an hour!
2011-09-09‎Even compared it to almost matching Agnes in '72 (worst flood in PA history). Rivers will die down in the coming hours but this is just..wow
2011-09-09‎and downtown. You cant get to ANYWHERE in central to eastern PA. Every bridge and road is closed. You cant get from Scranton to Williamsport
2011-09-09‎65,000+ people were forced to evacuate here in PA, just crazy. Makes me really appreciate living out away from the Susquehanna River
2011-09-09‎@Jurrasic_Jessy Noo!
2011-09-09‎@MysteryGuitarM I say both, but for the movie I say Pirates of the Cari-BEE-an for some reason
2011-09-08‎@abbadiego I'll be 19 on September 17th
2011-09-08‎@yosoyian Im not much for the Packers but was so happy when they beat the Steelers in XLV.
2011-09-08‎Nature's Fury - http://t.co/QMfnMB0  New video on the 2nd channel, with flood pics.
2011-09-08‎@yosoyian I dont mind the Saints. I was very happy for them when they won XLIV.
2011-09-08‎Who's ready for some football tonight  =D  So glad the regular season is finally starting. The seven month gap is always horrendously long!
2011-09-08‎@ShoemakerEric Fucking flooding buddy, say that three times fast
2011-09-08‎@ShoemakerEric Ah jeez  =(  Also being that it's only been over a week and 1/2 since Irene, we really dont need this right now.
2011-09-08‎@ShoemakerEric But after seeing pics on the news it's just crazy. Makes me really appreciate living away from the river.
2011-09-08‎@ShoemakerEric Yeah it seemed to just happen out of nowhere! I left Nanticoke yesterday & the roads were getting splotchy puddles everywhere
2011-09-08‎@SmoshIan You look like Paul McCartney lol in that senior picture
2011-09-08‎@ShoemakerEric into the Tunkhannock bridge.
2011-09-08‎@ShoemakerEric He's stuck down there for possibly days with one of the meat managers. Said he saw a house float down the river and smash
2011-09-08‎@makemebad35 Try online
2011-09-08‎@makemebad35 Yeah sucks those Canons dont have viewfinders, even more money you gotta spend on them.
2011-09-08‎Had to evacuate my mom's side business. My uncle needs to evacuate his home.
2011-09-08‎Luckily I dont need to evacuate since we're a distance from the Susquehanna River but I cannot believe how serious this is getting.
2011-09-08‎Tree in my backyard split in half. This apple tree is no more. http://t.co/QwF67KK
2011-09-08‎Evacuate there. This is unbelievable. Been raining for days and supposed to continue through Saturday.
2011-09-08‎Under evacuation here in PA in certain areas.My dad is possibly stuck around his work for two days. Gotta head down to my mom's work to help
2011-09-08‎@freakshow180 That sucks, hope you dont get flooded out!
2011-09-08‎@freakshow180 Do you have classes tomorrow? All of mine got cancelled! Damn rain!
2011-09-08‎@PointBaron No words haha
2011-09-08‎@makemebad35 And then they invented iPods  =)

2011-09-07‎Also posting some additional @makemebad35 bloopers on the main channel since there were just so many.About six more minutes worth of bloops!
2011-09-07‎@ICFWoodstock Try to collab with others! Every little bit helps bump you up!
2011-09-07‎@PointBaron That sucks! Hope it goes well!
2011-09-07‎@dpnh lmao
2011-09-07‎@freakshow180 At least Friday's I can sleep till 11 if I wanted.
2011-09-07‎@freakshow180 Wish I could sleep that late every day. Sucks because takes me a half hour to drive there.
2011-09-07‎I am a pillow whore. Do I honestly need 5 pillows when I go to sleep? YES!
2011-09-07‎@makemebad35 Means a lot being helped out. I know this video was long & stressing. But hey, hit me up if you ever need a favor sometime.
2011-09-07‎@makemebad35 Video is over 10,000 and is getting great ratings! Again, thank you for doing the blooper video, you didnt even have to.

2011-09-06‎Alligator 2 Damian bloopers! - http://t.co/WTlCqZh
2011-09-06‎@ICFWoodstock Thanks, glad the video turned out!
2011-09-06‎Gotta love them 2 hour breaks between classes
2011-09-06‎@RADICALisaac Damn you Dora, that song is still burned into my memory from childhood
2011-09-06‎@dpnh I've never seen an orange frog before
2011-09-06‎Hello mr. frog, please get the fuck off my window http://t.co/kR0AFYr
2011-09-06‎@buckhollywood Was going to point out the pose haha
2011-09-06‎@freakshow180 Sucks though that the guys that made me fail again and again are back to haunt me yet again lol at least it's a refresher
2011-09-06‎@freakshow180 refresher from last year already.
2011-09-06‎@freakshow180 And believe it or not, my Psych class is easier than Gilroy's (sarcasm). Our quizzes are multiple choice and it's just like a
2011-09-06‎@freakshow180 Yeah that would suck! Gotta go all the way back to the dorm and grab your shit. That's probably a real walk!
2011-09-06‎@smpfilms Or just watch youtube videos!
2011-09-06‎@PointBaron Because I would think it auto saves every minute or so. Guess that isnt the case. I've even had iMovie fuck up on me before.
2011-09-06‎@PointBaron Fucking hate that. Usually there would be an auto recovery that pops up. That sucks bro!
2011-09-06‎@PointBaron But you use Sony Vegas?
2011-09-06‎@PointBaron I remember when I had used movie maker, it would freeze and I'd lose the work I had done the past 15 mins. I got so pissed.
2011-09-06‎@smpfilms I would go Live on blogtv or something
2011-09-06‎@PointBaron Damn! How did that happen??
2011-09-06‎@makemebad35 Not surprised you're still editing bloopers. You got a shitload to edit through  =X
2011-09-06‎@jaelentruong Senior year for me flew. You look into colleges and before you know it graduation rehearsal hits you. It was my fav. hs year.
2011-09-06‎Hope those who start school tomorrow have a great first week, grade school or college! I've only started after labor day once or twice.
2011-09-06‎@jaelentruong Still in high school?
2011-09-06‎@livinginthenorm It hit me the other day and I thought, he has never said what his real name is
2011-09-06‎@TheArchfiend What is your first name?
2011-09-05‎@makemebad35 Just realized how much darker painted Mr. Wooden Alligator used to be in the older videos and talked lots slower.
2011-09-05‎@freakshow180 Could only imagine a video with you and your roommates, if you were to do that
2011-09-05‎@PointBaron thanks for getting the Shanty song stuck in my head from the vampire hunter video haha fits the video perfectly too!
2011-09-05‎Surprised it doesnt happen more often!
2011-09-05‎"Haha just fuckin dropped my $10 bill on the ground at the BK drivethru. The guy had it, I turned away and I hear ""Shittt"" lol got it though!"
2011-09-04‎possibly tomorrow!
2011-09-04‎Looks like the video is doing really well! I really do appreciate all of the great feedback! Bloopers will be posted on the Damian channel
2011-09-04‎Mr. Horse Head Meets Mr. Wooden Alligator 2 is here if you haven't seen it already!  =)   - http://t.co/0TXuMhF
2011-09-03‎@makemebad35 After the kitchen portion (my portion) the quality is more clear. Didnt have the time to go back and fix it.
2011-09-03‎@makemebad35 It shouldnt happen but after I rendered it a few times in 1080p to keep editing,the quality drained, which shouldnt be the case
2011-09-03‎@makemebad35 And looks like it's getting great feedback! Only problem is you'll notice your portion is a little choppy in quality.
2011-09-03‎@makemebad35 Okay now it just updated. But just want to say thanks again man for Facebooking it, tweeting it, and putting it on your channel
2011-09-03‎Took to prepare, write, film, & receive footage for this video. And now 9 months later, it's great seeing it come to life! Thanks everyone!
2011-09-03‎So far it seems the majority really enjoyed the video. Thanks so much, really do appreciate the great feedback! You have no idea how long it
2011-09-03‎@abbadiego Thanks for watchin!
2011-09-03‎@StaticCentury from seeing videos like those
2011-09-03‎@StaticCentury Well it goes to show sometimes that low budget videos can do well when done right  =)  So many are HD and nice to get a break
2011-09-03‎@makemebad35 When the custom thumbnail is up and running! The videos page is always ahead compared to the channel video module.
2011-09-03‎@makemebad35 Safari is a good browser too but the quality seems more like IE when you view YouTube channels. But hate that! Can never tell
2011-09-03‎@makemebad35 Same, Im using firefox lol Always use Firefox. But I used the custom upload time uploader, so couldnt change it right away
2011-09-03‎@RandomShadowMan Thank you! Took a long time to script and put this together  =)
2011-09-03‎@makemebad35 But no matter, it will switch eventually. But when are you posting bloopers?
2011-09-03‎@makemebad35 The my videos page says it's changed but on the channel it's still a default thumbnail. Changed it hours ago.
2011-09-03‎@makemebad35 But look at the video in the recent activity module on your channel. It isnt that thumbnail (nor on my channel)
2011-09-03‎@makemebad35 Glad you enjoyed video. Just saw your FB and YouTube channel. Thanks so much for posting it there. Im sure it will do great  =)
2011-09-03‎@paco13139 Thanks so much man, really do appreciate it!
2011-09-03‎Mr. Horse Head Meets Mr. Wooden Alligator 2 is here after nine months in the making! - http://t.co/0TXuMhF
2011-09-03‎@jaelentruong Sorry to hear you're leaving youtube though! Even being partnered!
2011-09-03‎One more hour and Mr Horse Head Meets Mr Wooden Alligator will be released!  @makemebad35
2011-09-03‎@sonicfreak04 bees are assholes
2011-09-03‎@paco13139 lol thanks for watching man
2011-09-03‎FACT, I cannot stand moths! I just had one with a grudge against me, trying to take my head off.
2011-09-02‎Not much traffic either. He coulda busted me with a $200/$300 ticket. I didnt even hit the brakes. Got very luck, ONCE AGAIN!
2011-09-02‎Holy christ just blew past a state trooper going 75 in a 55. What kind of cop sits on an exit facing traffic? A sly one. Idk how I saw him.
2011-09-02‎Wow, got accepted as a partner on the 2nd channel, wtf??!   =)
2011-09-02‎@makemebad35 you need to tape yourself overnight lol would be creepy though. Dont be so afraid of spiders!
2011-09-02‎but will all be worth the watch. Uploading Saturday  =D  But as for me...I'm going to bed lol
2011-09-02‎So at 4:22 in the morning here, I just finished the Alligator 2 video. So glad it's done. It's a little lengthy, 8 mins
2011-09-02‎@livinginthenorm  =)
2011-09-02‎It's REALLY difficult cutting out things here. My goal was no more than 7 mins long. I'll see what I can do here to shorten this.
2011-09-02‎Jeez, uncut the video is over 8 minutes long. I gotta make one scene a deleted scene, which I will post on the 2nd channel.
2011-09-02‎@nnaatteeks And I believe he is doing fine  =)
2011-09-02‎@nnaatteeks Thursdays are long but I do enjoy most of the classes I have. And yes, he did give me some tips prior to me starting.
2011-09-02‎@makemebad35 Audio clips to it and it will be pretty much done with.
2011-09-02‎@makemebad35 Looking to have it posted around Noon Saturday. Going to post in 1080p so will upload overnight Friday. Just gotta add a few
2011-09-02‎@freakshow180 Dont tweet that to damian
2011-09-01‎@AmanVault Glad Im not the only one!
2011-09-01‎Another YouTube glitch. Look at the view counter on my 2nd channel. http://t.co/iNo69kC
2011-09-01‎@makemebad35 Going to post the video Saturday morning so just giving you the heads up!
2011-09-01‎@dpnh already like it more than high school. Some days are long but it's great
2011-09-01‎Thursdays are my longest days as you can probably tell
2011-09-01‎20 mins a break. Damn you Biology and your lab class   X(
2011-09-01‎What also sucks is Im in the same building all day except for one other class. I only get one break in between. I dont really consider
2011-09-01‎Class 9:30 - 5:20  today, ohhh boyyy  Gonna have to stock up on some energy drinks
2011-08-31‎@FNC not carolina lol I go to luzerne county community college in PA
2011-08-31‎Is it ironic that one of my classes is building 7, room 707 and I sit in seat 707-07? Seven's actually my favorite number.
2011-08-31‎@FNC I've seen lots of people at my college that look like you Jared lol
2011-08-31‎Time for some quality time with my pillow
2011-08-31‎Looks like I will be finally finishing the Alligator 2 video tomorrow. After weeks of editing this it will finally be done!
2011-08-31‎@makemebad35 Sounds like a web cam mic now
2011-08-31‎@makemebad35 Your flip cam mic sounds like it's blown out from you yelling the past few years lol even notice it in our video.
2011-08-30‎@RADICALisaac Yes. But most of them I own are copied from the early 2000s. Unless you have this certain chip thinger, you cant play them
2011-08-30‎@RADICALisaac haha you're all set there! I still have the PS2. I play it now and then. Im the type of guy that wont throw anything away.
2011-08-30‎@makemebad35 Nice! I see you got a big boost in subscribers from Defranco. I dont watch him but saw your fb post. That's awesome man.
2011-08-30‎@dpnh It is pretty long but I'd rather that than my part time job schedule.
2011-08-30‎@RADICALisaac Wish I still had my PS1. Have so many copied games on disks that I cant play anymore, that were great favorites.
2011-08-30‎@freakshow180 Friday I have one, which is great, but sucks I gotta drive all the way up there. At least you dont have to worry about gas.
2011-08-30‎@freakshow180 haha the most I have in one day is four. So pretty much every day I have three classes, just like last year of high school.
2011-08-30‎Today is one of my two LONG days of college. There 9:30 - 5:30. That's a long day haha but once I have work to do, it will go a lot faster.
2011-08-30‎So home now for a bit and gotta head right back for a bit. Enjoying college so far. Just want to get started with doing work!
2011-08-30‎So today I had an hour and 1/2 AND a two hour gap between classes. Sucks now but once classes pick up, the gaps will come in great handy.
2011-08-30‎@freakshow180 I actually have it set up that way lol Over 7200 emails in my gmail inbox
2011-08-30‎@dpnh http://t.co/zdkPOT8 - I got an email like that too. Probably just a glitch in the system yet again.
2011-08-30‎@nnaatteeks I got four years of school ahead of me. Going to cherish it while I can.
2011-08-30‎@sonicfreak04 They creep me out because I dont notice they do it! That's what makes me cringe.
2011-08-30‎@nnaatteeks Oh, it feels great. Wont in a few days when Im booked with mental work lol
2011-08-30‎@makemebad35 I remember the videos Smerdley made on spiders. Those made me cringe lol
2011-08-30‎@nnaatteeks side of campus which you parked right in front of and now are on the other side of campus!  XP
2011-08-30‎@makemebad35 insects are my biggest fear. Spiders dont scare me too much, just the fear of them crawling on me in my sleep...or my mouth XP
2011-08-30‎@nnaatteeks First day was pretty good. Went fast. Just a workout when you realize the one building youre supposed to be in is on the other
2011-08-30‎@RandomShadowMan haha you slowly begin to lose it lol no internet, no tv, no running water, no NOTHING. Just you and family with nothing.
2011-08-30‎@Nighty74 IDK how we got ours back. There's a tree that flattened and disconnected one of the lines in our neighbor's yard.
2011-08-30‎@makemebad35 Just got power back now after two whole days. Damn you #Irene
2011-08-30‎@Nighty74 By time I got home, it was over.
2011-08-30‎@Nighty74 I didnt record anything. Didnt have time. The storm happened overnight and had work at 9am the following morning.
2011-08-30‎@RandomShadowMan Damn man, I would've lost sanity
2011-08-30‎POWER IS BACK ON WOOOO!
2011-08-29‎This is like a test and I am failing it lol damn you #Irene! Give us our electricity back!
2011-08-29‎I cant check internet period. Cant watch tv. Cant shower at home. THANKFULLY, my grandparents have a generator so we can shower and watch tv
2011-08-29‎This is unbelievable haha
2011-08-29‎No power, no water, no internet. This...SUCKS ASS. Been two days now and expected to be a few more days. Trees down on lines here.
2011-08-29‎Looks like Im going to have no power for days here. Trees flattened some of the lines.
2011-08-29‎First day of college is great so far. Just a workout getting from one building to another! I had to park so far away too.
2011-08-29‎STILL no power. Been a full day now. Ohhh boyyy....
2011-08-29‎My grandparents have a generator so thankfully they have tv and showers running in case its still out tomorrow!
2011-08-29‎Never expected to be digging through my college books in the heart of darkness the night before the 1st day.Power better be back in the AM!
2011-08-29‎Full day without electricity. Cant even physically check Facebook/Twitter. No water running in the house and first day of college tomorrow
2011-08-28‎Two powerlines are down in our neighbors yards, hanging off the poles. That doesnt help at ALL. No power all day here.
2011-08-28‎No power here all day and wont for quite a while. Glad I was at work 20 miles away, had power there. Trees down everywhere on roads.
2011-08-28‎Saw lots of trees down on my way to work early this morning. One down the road from my house not even 200 yds away
2011-08-27‎@89Kris Yes haha I rarely watch the weather channel nowadays but just managed to catch the live report lol
2011-08-27‎Lmfao just saw a man streak behind the weather reporter on the Weather channel live hahaha
2011-08-27‎@MysteryGuitarM @severshed Congrats!
2011-08-27‎"@PointBaron You need to start putting annotations that say""Warning Do Not Watch While Eating or Drinking"" in the beginning of your videos ha"
2011-08-26‎Sounds like a train coming to a stop on railroad tracks when I am stopping. And just in time for college Monday, woo! X(
2011-08-26‎Great, so my car is having problems AGAIN. The same rotor is giving me problems. As if the brakes are shot again.

2011-08-26‎@freakshow180 @DP_NH Tweet whore, just like me!
2011-08-26‎@livinginthenorm ever since the beginning I've looked at it
2011-08-26‎One thing I hate about the new twitter is not being able to see where the tweet came, via web, echofon, blackberry, etc
2011-08-26‎@makemebad35 Hey Damian, sent you two DMs
2011-08-26‎Those with Facebook, see how well you really know me! - http://t.co/8YacaIu  See if you can answer all 12 questions correctly

2011-08-25‎@Flab149 Yeah I heard! Saw on yahoo.
2011-08-25‎Lots of pressure trying to get this out two days from now. I'd rather not rush and make sure the finished product is enjoyable.
2011-08-25‎@sonicfreak04 Well it will give me time to go back and edit out the easy way out editing that I did on certain parts
2011-08-25‎on the east coast, especially here. Also will give me some more time to finalize it.
2011-08-25‎Going to post the Alligator sequel NEXT Saturday. I know I said this Saturday but with this hurricane coming I expect lots of power outages
2011-08-25‎Maybe NEXT Saturday
2011-08-25‎Might be posting the Alligator video another day now because of the storm
2011-08-25‎@makemebad35 Yeah I was even having second thoughts posting Saturday. I might wait for another day.
2011-08-25‎@livinginthenorm Should've added windy in there!
2011-08-25‎My last day of summer break will be a wet one!

2011-08-24‎RT @dpnh: @PioneersProd  lol now you know why I don't get on a lot anymore it's time consuming
2011-08-24‎@jaelentruong It will be worth it, and yeah one of these days  =)
2011-08-24‎@RandomShadowMan That it is
2011-08-24‎I'd say Im half way done by now but got work at 5 so I need to get moving pronto!
2011-08-24‎Okay! No more Skype until I finish this video! Every time I say I'll get on for a few mins, it turns into hours! lol

2011-08-23‎@makemebad35 my mom just texted me about it but Im at work; didnt feel anything.
2011-08-23‎Finally back home. We were stuck in a traffic jam without moving for over an hour at the field. Plus the hour and 1/2 drive back, long wait!
2011-08-23‎@kungfualice I thought you were done!
2011-08-23‎traffic is a bitch though! stuck in about a 200 yard jam
2011-08-23‎What a game. 10 nothing Keystone. Something to see  =)  got some on flip
2011-08-23‎What a game this is, 10 nothing! Keystones killing them! Only 3rd inning!

2011-08-22‎But so far it looks great!
2011-08-22‎Well after pretty much 6 hours, finally finished editing the first scene. Going to do more tomorrow & possibly record the horse head lines
2011-08-22‎@paco13139 Thank you
2011-08-22‎So I'll edit EVERYTHING and then make cuts in the end as necessary.
2011-08-22‎This video may very well run 10 minutes and I dont want that to happen. Seven minutes is my goal, at MOST. But I doubt I can cut that much.
2011-08-22‎@paco13139 Some trick editing and other things. Plus editing through all of my fuck ups. Going to take all week.
2011-08-22‎@paco13139 Well I got to Photoshop a shitload of the second half of the video. Mainly every shot. And figure out what works and what doesnt
2011-08-22‎My only concern is the length it is going to be.
2011-08-22‎It's really great watching this idea from 9 months ago come to life. Im only a minute into the video but so far it is look awesome =)
2011-08-22‎@freakshow180 I watched them the first day you sent.Theyre fine  =)  Just going to..take me two days or so to get to that part of the vid =X
2011-08-22‎@paco13139 I edited about half of Damian's shots already. But it's my footage that is going to take days.
2011-08-22‎@paco13139 Damian sent me almost an hour and a half of footage. So editing Damian's lines, the Alligator shots, and adding Alligator lines.
2011-08-22‎So after over an hour and a half total in editing, would you believe Im only 36 seconds done with the video?
2011-08-21‎Alright here we go, going to start editing this.Also going to log the amount of hours along the way just to see in the end,how long it took.
2011-08-21‎@boredlittlegal And I didnt even record the Horse Head lines yet lol cant imagine if I did last night.
2011-08-21‎Well woke up this morning at 8am for work and my voice was blown out. Still kind of is. Just dead tired from mast night   X(
2011-08-21‎Still need to do the HH lines but I'll do that another day; my voice is shot.
2011-08-21‎There are 91 total clips from just me alone, filming this. Going to start editing tomorrow evening.
2011-08-21‎Like the official Facebook page - http://t.co/tVJZO4Y
2011-08-21‎@makemebad35 Sent you a DM
2011-08-21‎Did so many takes and felt like I was shooting a movie. So many interruptions but found a way to get it done. Week's worth of editing ahead!
2011-08-21‎Longest video I have ever shot in my life. The Whale video took 2 and 1/2 hours. Peanuts compared to this video. I'm tired lol
2011-08-21‎Well just finished filming. Took me 5 hours. 5 hours!! Such a long shoot! Ran out of tape just as I finished. 6:15pm - 11:15pm
2011-08-20‎Off to film the video and trash my voice for the rest of the night!
2011-08-20‎Filming Mr. Horse Head Meets Mr. Wooden Alligator 2 today. Can't believe after 9 months I'm finally doing this!

2011-08-20‎RT @dpnh: umm interesting night @pioneersprod has people in his basement  and one of them is @livinginthenorm
2011-08-20‎@dallascowboys Great new additions!
2011-08-20‎Wrote the script in about 10 minutes. Almost a new record! These are easy to write.
2011-08-20‎"Haha I just got a pretty good idea for a new ""Ridiculous"" video. I can't believe this idea didnt hit me sooner!"
2011-08-20‎@makemebad35 Check your DMs, one last thing I need done.
2011-08-19‎Theres a fuckin yellow jacket with a grudge on me for some reason in the cart bays. Keeps following me bay to bay; fucker! Whatd I do to u?!
2011-08-19‎#FollowFriday @makemebad35 @freakshow180 @dpnh @muscleryan @livinginthenorm @twelthofadime @smosh @CyberAceTV @synthplaya @smpfilms
2011-08-19‎@muscleryan @dpnh Thanks for the FF
2011-08-19‎footage on the computer already. From the footage I've seen, it's already topped last year's video. Cant wait to edit this cluster fuck.
2011-08-19‎You have no idea how long it's taking to get this Alligator footage haha takes 4-7 hours just to download two clips! Have about 75% of the
2011-08-19‎@dpnh Group chat skype?
2011-08-18‎@makemebad35 Slight problem, check your DMs
2011-08-18‎@Nighty74 Some were used and still were outrageous
2011-08-18‎@nnaatteeks I know, prices are insane. $250 for a brand new biology book. what?!
2011-08-18‎@kungfualice I know it's insane. I even bought some used books and prices were still crazy.
2011-08-18‎Just spent $837 on college books. Im shocked, $36 for a hundred page tiny bowling book. Glad I didnt pay   ;)
2011-08-18‎Decapitation! http://t.co/9F6iaKn
2011-08-18‎@paco13139 This is worse than the last time. They better fix this soon.
2011-08-18‎@YouTube Your views counter is broken on videos!
2011-08-18‎Great, the YouTube views counter is broken AGAIN. I just watched a partner's video that was stuck at 2 views. TWO!
2011-08-18‎@smpfilms Why are you traveling so much?
2011-08-18‎@kurt13warner I hear the vet was pretty shitty. Im a Cowboys fan. I wouldnt dare go to a Philly game today. They throw batteries at you!
2011-08-18‎@smpfilms Just what I'd like to read right now lol
2011-08-17‎@Flab149 I was going to add you but then realized I already had haha
2011-08-17‎@nnaatteeks I hope it is. I havent seen ANY footage yet so temptation keeps growing lol but editing this is going to take forever
2011-08-17‎@muscleryan hahaha I surely hope not!
2011-08-17‎@makemebad35 Let me know when you're sending some footage, and check your DMs too.
2011-08-17‎Is it me or is Twitter dying down a bit?
2011-08-17‎@nnaatteeks If all goes well I plan on filming Friday, that is if I have all of the footage. Really just depends on this video. We'll see.
2011-08-17‎@nnaatteeks Not sure. I work tonight and Friday. Possibly Saturday night if Im not really busy editing this. Still waiting on footage.
2011-08-17‎@Troy_Aikman Im more towards Scranton. Pretty warm here too. Been pretty cloudy lately and cool.
2011-08-17‎This is just crazy - http://t.co/vzMo2S3
2011-08-17‎@smoshanthony In the end the pizza wont win. It might beat the pickle but shooting an entire food battle with pizza would be pretty hard.
2011-08-17‎@makemebad35 and they RARELY appeal videos as you said. That great!  =)
2011-08-17‎@buckhollywood That Taylor Swift thumbnail, that is the most ridiculous face ever by you haha
2011-08-16‎@Nighty74 footage yet, so we'll see what happens.
2011-08-16‎@Nighty74 of the video. Sometimes things just work. The video is going to be pretty long as it is but you never know. I havent seen any
2011-08-16‎@Nighty74 Well you never know. Last year I used some clips that were partially blooper clips and some other clips that werent even part
2011-08-16‎@Nighty74 I should write in a decapitation but will stay away from that haha
2011-08-16‎@Nighty74 Very true. Nine months in the making too. I know this one will be a good one. But still sucks about that happening.
2011-08-16‎@Nighty74 haha just ironic that Im the one that lead to it
2011-08-16‎@Nighty74 Same here. I'd feel terrible knowing I ended the series.
2011-08-16‎@Nighty74 Someone made it for him so wasnt purchased.
2011-08-16‎@Nighty74 It is wood. But I dont know. Not sure if it attached all together. Like a head, body, and tail section. No idea.
2011-08-16‎@dpnh He was able to finish shooting but said it was very difficult. But wasnt entirely my fault. He was kind of broken a few months ago.
2011-08-16‎"@Nighty74 He was kind broken a little back a few months ago. So wasnt ""entirely"" my fault but from one of the scenes, his head broke off"
2011-08-16‎@Nighty74 No joke. Just got word. I wont get the footage until tomorrow.
2011-08-16‎I have yet to see the footage of when it happened but will tomorrow. It was from one of the scenes I wrote.
2011-08-16‎"I broke Damian's Alligator. I feel terrible. ""This could be the last alligator video. His whole head portion is broken off."""
2011-08-16‎@makemebad35 let me know when you're sending footage
2011-08-16‎Looks like I will be filming Mr. Horse Head Meets Mr. Wooden Alligator 2 on Friday. After 9 months in the making, finally doing it!
2011-08-16‎@makemebad35 Sent you a DM
2011-08-16‎@makemebad35 into that video, not to mention guts to get that video made. That sucks man.
2011-08-16‎@makemebad35 People are assholes anymore. What did it violate? My only guess is the poop part. That's bullshit. You put all of that work
2011-08-16‎@Troy_Aikman Saw you playing as a young kid back in 99 at Texas Stadium. Glad I got to see a true hall of famer play  =)
2011-08-16‎Why do some DVDs play with subtitles on by DEFAULT?! Especially in Spanish! Dumb and Dumber and the Cable Guy are prime examples.
2011-08-15‎@makemebad35 and you're SURE you understand everything?
2011-08-15‎@makemebad35 do you have some sort of idea of when you're going to film this week?
2011-08-15‎@GBainsVFC18 sorry for the scares!
2011-08-15‎@TechElite9375 Figured it out  =)
2011-08-15‎Wow @RADICALisaac is a fucking genius. Thank you! Simply dragged the video to the iTocuh section and it synched. Thanks man!
2011-08-15‎Hmm nothing seems to work. I even tried to export for iPod compatible option in iMovie. Tried MOV export and a normal MP4 export, NOTHING.
2011-08-15‎@RADICALisaac Trying to get some YouTube videos onto my iTouch.
2011-08-15‎@makemebad35 But my bed isnt that high from the floor, probably couldnt even if I wanted to
2011-08-15‎@livinginthenorm That's it. If I leave home I have no Wi-Fi.
2011-08-15‎@livinginthenorm the iTouch anywhere
2011-08-15‎@livinginthenorm haha it's fine if you are. I'm willing to try anything. Would be nice to watch some videos since I dont have internet on
2011-08-15‎@makemebad35 I did haha 11 - 2:30am. Had to wake up early at 8 today for work. Took me probably 2:30 to 3 to fall asleep. Dont have insomnia
2011-08-15‎@livinginthenorm Damn you apple!
2011-08-15‎@makemebad35 Nothing worked. Guess I shouldve tried that....
2011-08-15‎@makemebad35 I was about to last night. I laid with my eyes shut for over a half hour, couldnt sleep. 4 hours later I laid another half hour
2011-08-15‎@livinginthenorm I did. I used keepvid to convert to a 480p mp4 file.
2011-08-15‎RT @makemebad35: You know what? Fuck it. I'm sleeping under my bed tonight.
2011-08-15‎Still new with iPods so help me out here
2011-08-15‎Anyone know how to put videos onto iTouch? I tried adding a MP4 file into the movie's section in iTunes but my videos on the iPod have none.
2011-08-15‎@kungfualice Shot in the fucking face! That ending made my day haha
2011-08-15‎Show was great! Thanks everyone who stopped in and chatted! Not sure when I'll do another one. Prob a week.
2011-08-15‎@makemebad35 Hey Damian, sent you some DMs the other night.

2011-08-14‎Obviously I don't have insomnia but dammit I just wanna sleep!
2011-08-14‎Need to wake up at 8am to work at nine. I'm going to be pretty grouchy come morning. #InsomniaSucks
2011-08-14‎@boredlittlegal that should help =]
2011-08-14‎Tried sleeping 4 hours ago wtf is wrong with my brain?!!?
2011-08-14‎I still can't sleep. This....is...not....good!
2011-08-14‎@jaelentruong It's like when I get asked to stay an extra hour, I instantly say no
2011-08-14‎@livinginthenorm I even tried visualizing boring activities, still nothing.
2011-08-14‎Got to be up early for work tomorrow!
2011-08-14‎I've had my eyes shut for literally the past half hour trying to fall asleep and can't. WTF IS WRONG WITH MY MIND?!
2011-08-14‎Alligator sequel looking to be filmed this coming week, finally!  =)
2011-08-14‎@makemebad35 Great vid man. I think I actually like the How To's more than the Alligator/Giraffe videos!
2011-08-13‎@davedays Happy birthday man!
2011-08-13‎YOUR FACE! GOD DAMMIT! You smacked your face!
2011-08-13‎@makemebad35 Hey Damian, can you answer some questions that I sent to your youtube inbox? That should kill some time while you upload haha

2011-07-23‎@MattMemelo Mine is fine. Youtube's been really glitchy lately though.
2011-07-23‎@CyberAceTV Oh Im thinking of the G+ url lol
2011-07-23‎@CyberAceTV How'd you do that? Not that Im going to but looked up earlier and couldnt find a way.

2011-07-22‎@makemebad35 Didnt know you use a 7D AND a 5D. That's awesome. Looking to save up for a 550D/Tsi in a few months.
2011-07-22‎@jaelentruong I dont blame them though, they cant respond to millions of users
2011-07-22‎@jaelentruong I hate having partnership issues.I want to talk directly to an employee,not automated response telling me to go to help forums
2011-07-22‎@TheRealRyanHiga Youtube's been really glitchy lately, with the views and all too, especially the recent activity box. Only shows one update
2011-07-22‎@paco13139 Theyre fixing it but SLOWLY.
2011-07-22‎YouTube is even more glitchy lately. My recent activity box on my channel only shows one update & my last sign in is STILL broken  @youtube

2011-07-21‎@muscleryan I've come close to biting the big one. Lost my driver's side tire WHILE driving! Going over 60.
2011-07-21‎@imatu777 It was BIG
2011-07-21‎behind him. Hit the brake (not hard) and skid all the way down the hill leaving a burn out trail of smoke lol didnt mean to, just happened!
2011-07-21‎Was on my way to work running late, going 65 around the top of the hill corner and saw a farmer pulling a trailer of crops with another car
2011-07-21‎http://twitpic.com/5tmq16 - My car has taken such a beating since I starting driving it last summer. Look at this tire mark I did yesterday

2011-07-21‎@DeniseVlogs The only thing I wish Google+ had is a wall like Facebook to post stuff to you
2011-07-20‎Gonna need to save up for a good lens too though, but will be worth it in the long run!
2011-07-20‎It's also pretty much half the price, depending where you buy. Almost half way there in savings so shouldnt be too long before I have enough
2011-07-20‎After a great reference from someone on Facebook, gonna start saving up for a Canon 550D. Not quite the 7D but pretty damn close in quality!
2011-07-20‎@paco13139 haha really? That is crazy lol

2011-07-20‎@DorkyByNature That wouldnt go so well lol
2011-07-20‎Anyone know if there is a way to automatically randomize clips in iMovie instead of manually moving them around?
2011-07-20‎@danieltosh Who is your favorite NFL team?
2011-07-20‎@DorkyByNature hahaha
2011-07-19‎@buckhollywood Holy crap, I sent you a friend request years ago and just check and you finally accepted lol woo!

2011-07-19‎@KristinRoseFNC Hey Kristin, does Jarred have a twitter? I know you share the @FNC one.
2011-07-19‎@dpnh I saw they were down but this picture glitch has always been like that since I joined.
2011-07-19‎@freakshow180 Did he really?? Best wishes to him.
2011-07-19‎@dpnh Thanks, just screencapped it from the new video. Sometimes you get lucky.
2011-07-19‎@freakshow180 hahaha it's def. better than Pepsi
2011-07-19‎I hit delete image and next thing you know the pic I want is displayed. WTF???!
2011-07-19‎I fucking hate changing profile pictures on twitter. It takes too long to switch. I change it & it goes back to the previous picture I used
2011-07-19‎@smpfilms Is it serious?
2011-07-19‎@nnaatteeks I filmed at a random location this time.
2011-07-18‎@nnaatteeks lol it's funner when you have someone to help film it in public
2011-07-18‎@DeniseVlogs What are friends for  =)  But still thats terrible about the car.
2011-07-18‎@DeniseVlogs Oh man, thats awful. Hope youre alright. I thought your phone was stolen too?

2011-07-18‎Shit, so one of my friends that's going to be in the new Whale video cant make it to shooting today. Damn, this REALLY hurts the video.
2011-07-18‎@makemebad35 I think yours are up-to-date
2011-07-18‎@makemebad35 A viewer of mine has had views stuck at 302 for days. But saw yours, yesterday was only like 10,000.
2011-07-18‎not displaying who I message most!  =/
2011-07-18‎That new Facebook chat sidebar is annoying as hell. I hide it and next thing you know it comes back. It was nice the way it was,
2011-07-18‎@imatu777 Haha I just blankly did it. Someone tagged me in it and had some free time so I filled it in.
2011-07-18‎@makemebad35 Gotta be stressful editing, jeez...Im sure they'll turn out great  =D
2011-07-18‎@makemebad35 Awesome! When theyre all edited are you going to post them both within two weeks?

2011-07-17‎@davedays Now thats classy!
2011-07-17‎People have given me codes but they dont work.
2011-07-17‎Anyone know a good free screen recording software? I have screenflow but none of the codes work for the full version. I have the watermark
2011-07-17‎@paco13139 Jeez I dont really know. Is it getting viewed at all? Like multiple new comments?
2011-07-17‎@nnaatteeks Thanks Nathan  =)
2011-07-17‎@paco13139 Still? Damn, it's been a few days?
2011-07-17‎@nnaatteeks Project here too

2011-07-17‎@KristinRoseFNC Happy birthday Kristin! Just followed  =)
2011-07-17‎@boredlittlegal Thank you, we're doing alright.

2011-07-17‎@kevjumba Hahaha that is gold!
2011-07-17‎OMG, this new Whale video I'm writing may be one of my best videos yet. This video is going to be so crazy. 3 teens, 1 Whale, picture it.
2011-07-17‎@shanedawson If only the layout was good. It's terrible. It's too cluttered!
2011-07-17‎@CyberAceTV Now and then. Usually if we're celebrating something. I only have one drink.
2011-07-17‎At least I get some fun, even if it's a few hours after it ended.
2011-07-17‎The best reward for a hard day's night of work is a nice cold beer. Had to work during a cookout we had with family today and missed it.
2011-07-16‎@paco13139 Anytime!  =)
2011-07-16‎*1/4 way through
2011-07-16‎Through because Im so tired lol I've seen the first 6.
2011-07-16‎All of this Harry Potter talk is making me watch Part 7. I havent seen the first part so here goes. Probably will only make it 1.4 way
2011-07-16‎@paco13139 Every video freezes when it gets over 300 views. Could take hours to update. Mine usually updates overnight.
2011-07-16‎@HarTerry Really? lol even though my camera screwed up?

2011-07-16‎@autumn_angel92 Anytime!

2011-07-15‎@kungfualice Thank you very much Alicia. The support has been wonderful and really do appreciate it. He's on meds and doing fine now.
2011-07-15‎Live tonight at 8pm ET for a little bit on Blogtv. Not long though.
2011-07-15‎Unbelievable, the video wasnt removed. Youtube says it doenst violate privacy. Jesus Christ.
2011-07-15‎@MattMemelo Remind me about collabing. IDK who's channel we'd put it on. Most likely yours I'd imagine. Just dont want to forget here.
2011-07-15‎@imatu777 I cringe at the thought that I will be making an appearance soon
2011-07-15‎RT @twelthofadime: Cosmic panda sucks my cosmic cock.
2011-07-15‎@Kalabreannezorz partnership program gives partners money for their videos with ads and their total views
2011-07-15‎@paco13139 sure, send me a script to my youtube
2011-07-14‎RT @RADICALisaac: @RayWJ try doing something different in the RWJ channel. Your stealing peoples videos and making money off of it.
2011-07-14‎@RADICALisaac true...true
2011-07-14‎@Scottmscottm Flagged as spam, scam/fraud. False flagged in my mind. Even appealed it. Still rejected.
2011-07-14‎@makemebad35 Made a HUGE decision today. Read my tweets from today.
2011-07-14‎Have done before
2011-07-14‎Thanks for having my back everyone. I dont want to sound like a chode lol Just speaking the truth and making a statement that only a few
2011-07-14‎@nnaatteeks Which IDK how I will be able to conjure up lol we'll see down the road.
2011-07-14‎@nnaatteeks I'm definitely doing more videos with James.Already have an idea here for an upcoming video.People even want a Playground sequel
2011-07-14‎@nnaatteeks Well I've gotten a great deal of help over the past few years and really am thankful for it.
2011-07-14‎As TheArchfiend would say, That Is All.
2011-07-14‎And also want to prove a point and put him in his place. Im sick of him making thousands upon thousands of dollars off of stolen videos.
2011-07-14‎@nnaatteeks A few hundred
2011-07-14‎"Ray's video if you will. Dont want to call it ""fame""."
2011-07-14‎"But yeah just wanted to get my point across here and trust me it is definitely the right thing to do. I've already got my ""recognition"" from"
2011-07-14‎@nnaatteeks Like I said, I got my payoff already.A lot of new subscribers and viewers. Not many more are going to climb aboard in the future
2011-07-14‎@nnaatteeks Well the majority that was gonna see Ray's video have seen it already so I dont expect Im getting many subs still from it
2011-07-14‎@dpnh Not re-uploading Dave lol
2011-07-14‎But I am very thankful Ray did everything he did for me. But now it's a different matter.
2011-07-14‎Plus I've already got my payoff from it.I filed a privacy complaint because I have no proof really that the video was mine because it's gone
2011-07-14‎@fuen Too Fat To Die, about four videos ago
2011-07-14‎@nnaatteeks That doesnt matter. I just dont want his video up with it in it anymore. If my orignal video cant be seen, no one should see it
2011-07-14‎@dpnh Noo because I have a strike already and really do not want to risk another
2011-07-14‎@oldgregg2247 Exactly my point
2011-07-14‎When that video is removed (Too Fat To Die), I will get trashed by his fans I guarantee but still, I've said what needs to be said.
2011-07-14‎I'd rather have my video back & not have him get millions upon millions of views & hundreds of dollars off of it when I dont have my video
2011-07-14‎Why should my video be removed and Ray get thousands of dollars off of it? I dont care that he's #1 most subscribed either.
2011-07-14‎I realize he did me a HUGE favor, but in reality I’d rather not be mentioned and have my video back.
2011-07-14‎A video that I posted, which was flagged and taken down. The video will most likely be removed in two days.
2011-07-14‎For one, he never got permission from me to use my video, and two, why should he still get all of the fame from
2011-07-14‎You guys very well may stone me for this but I flagged RayWilliamJohnson’s video that he mentioned me in.
2011-07-14‎Thanks for all of the support last night. He's home now and on meds. Really means a lot to me, it does.
2011-07-14‎@jaelentruong It is nice though to make money off of what I love to do though.
2011-07-14‎@jaelentruong For me it's not about money it's just for the love of the hobby. Been doing this for over three years and still love doing it
2011-07-14‎@dld95 Thanks man, getting lots of support through Twitter and Facebook. Means a lot, it really does.
2011-07-14‎Thanks so much guys, means a lot. Im praying he recovers here and it isnt serious. My mom's been there forever. Cant imagine how she feels.
2011-07-14‎@MysteryGuitarM You tell her Joe!
2011-07-14‎@kungfualice He has copd but was sent to the ER because his heart was beating too fast. Been sick for the past two days.Running tests on him
2011-07-14‎He has copd. Its a lung disease but what he went to ER for was his heart was beating too fast. He has been sick for the last 2 days.
2011-07-14‎@jaelentruong That's stupid. What's the purpose of the partnership program if they switch to that?
2011-07-14‎@kungfualice Thanks Alicia. He was just diagnosed with some disease dealing with his lungs.
2011-07-14‎My grandfather's in the ER. Please send prayers. Need them right now.
2011-07-14‎Now I've seen everything http://twitpic.com/5pribg
2011-07-13‎@jaelentruong I noticed my banner disappeared. IDK if I would have to re-add it.
2011-07-13‎@smpfilms I think it's a terrible change. It wont be YouTube anymore if they switch.
2011-07-13‎@makemebad35 Different columns and tabs
2011-07-13‎@makemebad35 Hard to explain. On the beta channels everything is visable. The new ones everything is divided into sections.
2011-07-13‎"New video ""Major Changes Coming to YouTube"" - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=28PIyVnAcrk"
2011-07-13‎If @YouTube switches to that new layout, it wont even be YouTube anymore. That is all such a mess.

2011-07-13‎RT @makemebad35: Make sure you leave your thoughts when checking out Youtubes new future layout http://t.co/6ap4Pol. Feedback tab is on  ...
2011-07-13‎@makemebad35 Visible at once on channels? They better not switch to that.
2011-07-13‎@makemebad35 OMG, if they switch to that, it wont even be youtube anymore. That is such a mess. Why divide everything up when it was all

2011-07-12‎Ironic it goes in order of which the events happened, top to bottom. It has reached the bottom now. Getting a little nervous here lol
2011-07-12‎It's the 3rd scar on my right leg. All my life my right leg has gotten beat up from mid-shin to high ankle. Hope a broken leg isnt next

2011-07-12‎@RayWJ That's awesomeness!
2011-07-12‎@kungfualice Would you really want to go through another 7 years of school?
2011-07-12‎47 days until college, woo!
2011-07-11‎@DeniseVlogs Seriously? Damn people are really low today. What kind of phone was it?
2011-07-11‎@ARCSCOOBYDOO At least it would  be doing something I LIKE to do. Wont be as bad.
2011-07-11‎Time is a bitch
2011-07-11‎Humming during work is the only thing that keeps me sane. Fricking hate these 7  1/2 hour shifts!
2011-07-11‎Took Dayquil and Zyrtrck and didn't help much at all
2011-07-11‎Dinner was good but couldn't taste anything; sooo congested!
2011-07-11‎@dpnh really? They're not paying you though?
2011-07-10‎Pretty light headed too. Hope this goes away! I have NEVER been sick in summer. EVER!
2011-07-10‎Starting to think I have a head cold. Been almost a week and still have it. Going out for my dad's bday so hopefully that will help.
2011-07-10‎Everyone wish my dad a happy 49th birthday!
2011-07-09‎@Shubamz Wasnt the best I've ever had....
2011-07-09‎So I tried the Bacon Cheddar Tendercrisp and it was $8.15!  WTF??
2011-07-09‎And might go for it. It's not long since it's my first one.
2011-07-09‎Cant believe Im actually posting this but I may do a music video in the next few months. Actually have a short song written here
2011-07-09‎Hate to say this but I think I have summer allergies. My left nostril has been blocked and runny for days and my throat just hurts.
2011-07-09‎Turned the A/C on to help ignore it if it comes back. Turned a light on for a few mins and no mosquito. Go away!
2011-07-09‎A mosquito literally just buzzed by my ear. I heard it. That mosquito sound. Ugh, I was just about to fall asleep.
2011-07-09‎@dpnh Saw two commercials for it today. Def. gotta buy one at work tomorrow. Only limited time only!
2011-07-09‎I want to try that bacon cheddar tendercrisp from Burger King sooo bad!
2011-07-08‎@PointBaron Apparently they dont know how to fix the Justin Bieber era
2011-07-08‎@PointBaron Hahaha you better not be filming this
2011-07-08‎I only pray RayWilliamJohnson doesnt pick that video up.
2011-07-08‎Just read the article on this - http://youtu.be/B_JEFbVcQro  The fact his son witnesses it and it being on TV makes it even worse. Just sad.
2011-07-08‎@smpfilms Twitpic it!
2011-07-07‎It's all about this $$$$ and it's the sad, God awful truth. Sorry youtube but LIES.
2011-07-07‎They said they were cracking down on this but they have NOT.The most-viewed page is all Shane & other top-elites. Give lower users a chance
2011-07-07‎Shane Dawson uses missleading thumbnails & titles in every video while RayWJ steals content making thousands off of videos not owned by him
2011-07-07‎But that video is bullshit
2011-07-07‎Nothing against Will or anything
2011-07-07‎I dont mean to call anyone out but the newest partnersupport video about the community guidelines is mostly all lies.
2011-07-07‎@dpnh No, I havent.
2011-07-07‎Always when I have to wake up early I try to go to sleep early but there's always SOMETHING that prevents me from doing so!
2011-07-07‎@smoshanthony Looks like theyre heading backwards rather than forwards

2011-07-05‎@makemebad35 Oh man, didnt hear about that. That's rough  =(
2011-07-05‎@kungfualice So sorry to hear about your loss Alicia. I lost my grandfather in middle school. Stay strong.
2011-07-05‎@makemebad35 You should go live tonight, been forever!
2011-07-05‎Even years later, I still laugh my ass off at these cartoons. Havent seen them in almost a decade.
2011-07-05‎No joke, I've been watching Road Runner and Daffy Duck cartoons on youtube for over 5 hours
2011-07-04‎@CyberAceTV Not your fault. I guess it needs to be flagged a certain amount of times.
2011-07-04‎Happy 4th of July everyone!
2011-07-04‎Congrats Chestnut, another Hot Dog Eating Contest championship for you
2011-07-04‎"""Truck Video Flagged"" - http://youtu.be/-BH3HgA36zo"
2011-07-04‎Uploading a video now about it.
2011-07-04‎@makemebad35 At least yours is probably still viewable
2011-07-04‎@makemebad35 Looks like you joined the club! Back at you, that really sucks. I guess the hammer in the mouth did it.
2011-07-04‎@MattMemelo Violated terms of use as being graphic. Says it was flagged as spam, scam/fraud but I believe it was b/c of graphic content
2011-07-04‎@makemebad35 At least it's airing on TV!
2011-07-04‎@makemebad35 Then with what was coming. In a way Im glad because I didnt want to get huge off of a video that was of someone else. But still
2011-07-04‎@makemebad35 Uploading a video about it now. At least I wasnt getting revenue from it. When the ads were disabled it should've hit me
2011-07-04‎@RADICALisaac Thanks for your support
2011-07-04‎For those wondering, I was NOT making revenue off of that video. But jeez, my most viewed video ever, taken down.
2011-07-04‎@CyberAceTV that REALLY sucks. I wasnt making money off of the video though.
2011-07-04‎So just got word back from YouTube and the video is going to remain rejected. 250,000k views gone. What a shame.
2011-07-04‎@dpnh Thanks for the kind words Dave lol I know, it's bullshit. Been over 3 days and still no reply. I have a feeling it will be appealed
2011-07-03‎I hate my job (NOT youtube), good-day!
2011-07-03‎@makemebad35 I'd like ti see thrm try to edit a vid that way. Guess people just dont appreciate HD dark videos, which IDK why. Good job man
2011-07-03‎Wow what a storm this morning! Is this the tropics?!

2011-07-02‎YouTube you're still glitching! Every time I go to change the video thumbnail I get the clock thumbnail @youtube
2011-07-02‎Here's a crazy @Freakshow180 video I was in - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMRa1PnxV4E&feature=feedu
2011-07-02‎RT @Freakshow180: New Freakshow180 video (with @PioneersProd) - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMRa1PnxV4E RT?
2011-07-02‎So my brother's car was hit twic in the same week. He bought it last week. What are the chances of that happening?! It's a 2004 car.
2011-07-01‎Still awaiting a reply from YouTube on the violation. If they put the video back up my strike will be removed.
2011-07-01‎@jojozeeify I know, I appealed it and now I have a community guidelines strike on my account. Waiting on a reply.
2011-07-01‎@davedays Long sleeves in summer?

2011-07-01‎@will83tnt Someone flagged it, so Im waiting back on my appeal
2011-07-01‎"Here are the Bloopers for ""Playground Hell"" on the 2nd channel - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pz5yepZl14U"
2011-07-01‎This doesnt make any sense, somehow people are still commenting on the Truck video, even though it's unavailable, wtf??
2011-07-01‎@PointBaron Your tweets always amuse me, never stop

2011-06-30‎"New video! ""Deathground"" - http://youtu.be/m3Yhp0k1BCg For some reason it is 0% published in the subscription boxes"
2011-06-30‎@makemebad35 Im in a similar situation
2011-06-30‎http://twitpic.com/5j77i9 - Anyone guess what my videos about? Look at that air!
2011-06-30‎They're saying it was flagged as inappropriate. I appealed it so we'll see what happens. The strike will expire but still, that's bullshit.
2011-06-30‎Wow so I got a community guidelines strike for my Truck video, WTF YouTube?!
2011-06-30‎I think they all turned out great. Shot about 4 videos (3 for @Freakshow180) and 1 for my channel.
2011-06-30‎To us 2 hours to shoot everything today. I got woodchips in my shoes and my pockets. Lots of bloopers in this one.

2011-06-21‎@ARCSCOOBYDOO There's no @reply in your tweets lol
2011-06-21‎Makes the most sense in my mind.
2011-06-21‎I dont get nearly the views I do on the main channel and rather than have writer's blocks on there, why not just do vlogs in the meantime.
2011-06-21‎@ARCSCOOBYDOO Im guessing that was supposed to be an @reply? lol
2011-06-21‎And just use the 2nd channel for bloopers and such?
2011-06-21‎Do you guys think I should stop posting to the second channel and post vlogs that I do there now and then to the main channel?
2011-06-21‎@makemebad35 glad youre down to earth and respond to people
2011-06-21‎@makemebad35 thats the best part! Getting feedback and responding to that feedback. wish smosh and others would respond.

2011-06-21‎After looking at the Truck video again it just hit me. How ironic that it happened on my 3 year youtube anniversary.
2011-06-21‎@CyberAceTV And no there is no rentals option
2011-06-21‎@CyberAceTV Yes they sent me an email saying I was rejected for ad sharing. Ads WERE on it but were taken off a few days later.
2011-06-21‎@CyberAceTV Views are earning me revenue though. I cant get the ads back though. Theres no reapplying.
2011-06-21‎@CyberAceTV I am getting cash from it but the ads were removed by youtube, I guess for the content? I have no idea.
2011-06-21‎@Nighty74 Crazy isnt it?!
2011-06-21‎@Freakshow180 I submitted it for video breakdown the week I uploaded it so we'll see

2011-06-20‎"By ""name"" I mean my name (Randy Stair), not PioneersProductions."
2011-06-20‎Really difficult thought lol Cant see it being anything else. Guess I picked right three years ago.
2011-06-20‎Weird thought came to mind. If I could change my username....what would it be? Ive only had 1 my entire life.Used my name originally in 2008
2011-06-19‎I found a tiny fly in my corn on the cob tin foil lol just adds to the flavor

2011-06-12‎Possible Tru-Tv worthy

2011-06-07‎Cant afford to cut too much or people wont believe it happened. Im true to my words, it really was real.
2011-06-07‎It's 15 and 1/2 mins long. Jeez longest video I've ever made. Should be worth it. Had to for the hypnosis portion.
2011-06-07‎This part 2 will be pretty lengthy but will be worth it. Hypnosis portion is the bulk of it at end of the video so it will be over 10 mins
2011-06-07‎RT @mightylions1: @YouTube congrats on 3,000,000 followers and breaking into the top 50 most followed all time!
2011-06-06‎@makemebad35 I like how your new video is a sequel to your first video on youtube  =)

2011-05-18‎@makemebad35 I'd have to agree though, seems to down the Flip. It's amazing, these cameras today.
2011-05-18‎@makemebad35 Damn, thats great quality for that tiny camera. Well if you buy it, hopefully the zoom and battery life is way better
2011-05-18‎@makemebad35 It would seem hard to believe that a tiny camera like that could one-up the flip but anything's possible today
2011-05-17‎I know it wasnt but looked just like them, crazy!
2011-05-17‎I swear to god I think I just saw the mother that gave her 8 year old girl botox and her daughter at the store

2011-05-16‎I try to stick to water but thats hard to do when there isnt water in the break room at work. All there is is soda and iced tea.
2011-05-16‎See, Im a soda and energy drink kind of guy. I've drunken more soda this past year than I have probably the past two years combined.
2011-05-16‎@mrsanproduction Whats going on man?

2011-05-15‎Just finished editing. Took me over 3 hours. Uploading this afternoon!
2011-05-15‎@dpnh About 4 and 1/2 minutes
2011-05-15‎Finishing up editing here, just gotta add the questions onto the video. Might even get it up today.
2011-05-15‎@nnaatteeks I could literally make over a 10 minute blooper video. I dont think it's worth the extra time for this one lol
2011-05-15‎It took me 15 minutes to answer ONE question.
2011-05-15‎I'll most likely have the Q&A video up Monday. Taking me forever to edit because of all of the bloopers. Just..crazy.

2011-05-14‎Editing part of the Q&A video tonight and hoping to upload this weekend. I was unable to film it until today. Sooo many bloopers in this one
2011-05-13‎Kindergartners with mohawks just...dont look right

2011-05-10‎@dpnh So if Apple somehow ups the bid here, that would be great
2011-05-10‎@dpnh I've noticed there's differences between the Mac and the Windows versions. To me the Mac version is better.

2011-05-02‎This day is like reliving the death of Hitler. Feels very eerie. Def. feels good knowing we finally got him.
2011-05-02‎@livinginthenorm Very true. Our grandparents lived through WWI and WWII. We lived through the war on terror.
2011-05-02‎Think, Us a bunch of high school kids lived through a part of history today.We were alive when the most wanted man in US history was killed.
2011-05-02‎"Decades from now, the trivia question will be ""Who was president when Bin Laden was killed"". Who would guess it would be Obama  =X"
2011-05-02‎@smpfilms USA! USA!

2011-04-28‎@makemebad35 Youve been taking it well. Whats important is how much you both loved and cared for each other.

2011-04-26‎@imatu777 Well Bruno ate plenty of Almond Joys....but got sick obviously
2011-04-26‎@imatu777 Theyre dogs! They should bark at thunderstorms not cower from them
2011-04-26‎Every two seconds is a flash of lightning, Poor Bruno. Even after 9 years he is still afraid of thunderstorms.
2011-04-26‎This thunderstorm is crazy! Bruno is cowering beside me (my dog). Usually he would hide in my parents closet.
2011-04-26‎@kungfualice Hope it goes well. Stay strong, all of you
2011-04-26‎After watching James Nintendo Nerd you kinda want to play Nintendo again. Still have my Nintendo 64 at least  =)
2011-04-26‎Got rid of it at the county cleanup last year because it didnt work anymore. I had two consoles. I might try to buy one but prob wont work
2011-04-26‎I must say I am shocked that there are Nintendo Entertainment Systems (NES) on Ebay. The original Nintendo. Wish I still had mine.
2011-04-26‎@imatu777 @CyberAceTV Had to let it go
2011-04-25‎I would bring him everywhere I went when I was little. Why did I still have him today? I have no idea. #RIPBingo

2011-04-12‎@nnaatteeks Thanks man, didnt even know how to react. I just burst out laughing because of the adrenaline rush.
2011-04-12‎@dpnh Tow truck isnt coming for it until tomorrow which REALLY sucks. Put a bag in the window.Thats all I can do.The tire too is still there
2011-04-12‎If I'd been on the highway, probably wouldnt be here right now and thats the scary part. I have college tomorrow at THAT same time.Got lucky
2011-04-12‎When you see your tire bouncing in your rear-view mirror....thats not good.
2011-04-12‎Thanks for all of the support. Man that was wild. I hope to God no one ever has to experience that. Eeriest thing I tell ya.
2011-04-12‎@89Kris I got the tires on three weeks ago. Theres no reason that ANYTHING should have come loose
2011-04-12‎@89Kris So it wont be drivable. The company that put the tires on better pay for the damage or I am going to have a nice chat with them
2011-04-12‎@89Kris Everything came off. The rotor is the only thing left and it dug into my car door and is now deformed. It is basically a half circle
2011-04-12‎@89Kris I probably wouldnt be here right now lol imagine where the tire could've gone! Couldve hurt someone else if there were car saround
2011-04-12‎@dpnh @imatu777 Thats my dad. He was working today thank god. I was around 5 miles from work

2011-04-03‎@livinginthenorm Im just going to avoid Jake's music all-together. There's no proof for documentation.
2011-04-03‎@livinginthenorm Especially because partner support kept turning me down. I didnt want to take a chance.
2011-04-03‎Added some additional music too.
2011-04-03‎"Reuploading ""Angry Pool Player"". I had to remove a music clip to avoid a potential copyright. Better safe than sorry."
2011-04-03‎Asked for 2 bbq sauces with my meal at BK and got 4, hell yeah!

2011-03-31‎@heyyitsmekc My @replies were crowded last night  X(
2011-03-31‎@dpnh Why do you @reply me when you are @replying Don?
2011-03-31‎@livinginthenorm I only have device updates on for Damian, and DMs always go to my phone
2011-03-31‎@livinginthenorm Oh trust me,it was worth reading every tweet. I feel bad for people who had device updates on though. It went on all night.
2011-03-31‎@livinginthenorm At least this isnt like the Onision and EmptysAwesome twitter fight. That was epic.
2011-03-31‎@makemebad35 Apparently someone hacked that ArshaAsteraki account so he isnt dead. Thats what he posted. Still kind of unsure.
2011-03-31‎@MrCrazyk33 I always wanted to shoot the whale, because he's always over capacity

2011-03-31‎@makemebad35 Alright well I posted to his FB and Twitter. We shall see
2011-03-31‎@MirroredTheory Hey used a portion of your music clip in my video. How can I credit you in the partner ad sharing form for the video?
2011-03-31‎@makemebad35 Because I gave credit in the description
2011-03-31‎@makemebad35 Great, I dont want to have to re-upload. Should I just lie saying I own all rights to the music
2011-03-31‎@makemebad35 Yeah but I dont want to not give credit. He could have the video removed if he wanted
2011-03-30‎Live on BlogTv yo!  Come say hello! - http://www.blogtv.com/people/PioneersProductionsBlog
2011-03-30‎@makemebad35 But I thought if you credit him in the description it's fine. YouTube keeps saying I need more documentation.
2011-03-30‎@makemebad35 He doesnt have anything on his channel or myspace stating his music is free for use
2011-03-30‎@makemebad35 Question, how can I credit Jake in the partnership revenue share form? I dont want to lie and so no to the music
2011-03-30‎@livinginthenorm Exactly

2011-03-29‎@ArkhalowFilms haha glad you liked it!
2011-03-29‎@ArkhalowFilms The second stick was broken purposely. Especially because the tip was ruined.
2011-03-29‎"@ArkhalowFilms So my reaction was real. I was going to cut the ""Oh shit I broke it"" out but it just seemed to fit lol"
2011-03-29‎@ArkhalowFilms haha thanks much! That was a container full of bullets and yes, two actually. The first was unintentional.

2011-03-22‎@livinginthenorm I'd rather be hot and sweaty than being locked up indoors shivering
2011-03-22‎@jimmyfallon I once had a dream that a naked woman went down my toilet #thatwasawkward
2011-03-22‎Once again we are getting snow tonight. Thank you Spring, you have started out awesome  =/
2011-03-22‎@makemebad35 You free to get on FB for a few mins tonight? Or are you still editing the 2nd channel video?

2011-03-22‎@Freakshow180 Interested in meeting up in the near future to shoot a video together? And vise-versa? I still have yet to write a script.
2011-03-22‎Def. will put less stress on me because I havent had time to do anything the past month with work. 5 days a week is rediculous.
2011-03-22‎So looks like I am only going to be working 3 days from now on. Failing Soc/Psychology with a 61 average and have no time to study
2011-03-22‎Worth it? lol http://twitpic.com/4bybw6

2011-03-21‎The moon is fucking huge tonight!
2011-03-20‎Is my only hope. Got an extra day off for a while though. 4 is better than 5 days.
2011-03-20‎Sundays always the worst day for me. Even a day later, I feel the effects of my 4-10 shift the night before.Cant keep this up. 20oz red bull
2011-03-20‎@Freakshow180 And it's two classes I wont have to take  ;D
2011-03-20‎@Freakshow180 But actually said that I should check out other places because there wasnt a studio there, which I was pretty shocked
2011-03-20‎@Freakshow180 After that half hour Q&A I talked with one of the professors in the cafe and they basically answered all of my questions
2011-03-20‎@Freakshow180 Well the thing is I actually have the grades for Misericordia. Kings, no way. And Wilkes Im not interested in.
2011-03-20‎@dpnh Which is another reason why I would prefer Misericordia
2011-03-20‎@dpnh If caught, $300 fine and a letter of apology to campus, AND 100 hours community service....I dont think I'd take the chance
2011-03-20‎@dpnh Actually the Keystone college is a dry campus. No drugs allowed. Only two tiny designated smoking areas as well.
2011-03-20‎@dpnh Studio and equipment.
2011-03-20‎@dpnh Life changing decisions! But this college has the best hands on experience in the region. The other college (Keystone) does NOT have a

2011-03-20‎@nnaatteeks I'd give it two weeks actually  =)
2011-03-20‎@dpnh Worth the wait! Paid my dues  =)
2011-03-20‎@CyberAceTV I've desperately needed a new computer for the longest time. Def. worth the wait saving up the cash.
2011-03-20‎Ohhh the moment of chowing down on Burger King when you havent had it in weeks   =}
2011-03-19‎However Stouffer's does still have the best tv dinners of all-time.
2011-03-19‎Ive said it before and I'll say it again. Why the fuck does the inside of my tv dinner box smell like new carpeting?!
2011-03-19‎One hundred dollars to go! Cant believe Ive almost saved up enough for an iMac. I will be so happy having a new computer!
2011-03-19‎@makemebad35 So what are you going to do? Leave it up or reupload?
2011-03-19‎@makemebad35 Never go PG, you got this far doing what you do best.
2011-03-19‎"@makemebad35 It sucks though because the ""How To"" videos are you're most popular. Didnt your How to Kiss vid get flagged as well?  =/"
2011-03-19‎RT @dpnh: @PioneersProd @makemebad35  no say it isn't so pg humor from you dude isn't right its like eating meat on lent
2011-03-19‎@dpnh Well none of my videos have ever been flagged. It would suck though. Not much you can do about it  =/
2011-03-19‎@makemebad35 But I mean you're not doing Shane Dawson type content. His dont even need questioning on why theyre flagged.
2011-03-19‎@makemebad35 What did they say was bad? I died laughing.

2011-03-16‎Struggling to keep my head up. Hate when that happens!
2011-03-16‎@buckhollywood Couldnt agree more. Always feel sluggish.
2011-03-16‎@makemebad35 Oh so you save your vids on the computer. i usually upload and delete afterwards (or flashdrive).

2011-03-07‎@Jurrasic_Jessy Eventually.....
2011-03-07‎Ohhh man I hate driving in the snow. Took me an entire hour to drive home. Very eerie feeling driving in the snow.
2011-03-07‎We got three inches of flooding rain last night through today.
2011-03-07‎The wind blows the ice right into your skin. It sucks so bad getting carts in this weather.
2011-03-07‎It's a giant mix of snow, ice, sleet, and rain. My feet are soaked. Apparently we are supposed to get up to a foot of snow tonight? No idea.
2011-03-07‎Of course the one day I wear longer work pants to work it fuckin floods in the parking lot.

2011-03-06‎@nnaatteeks My paychecks havent been substantial lately & factoring in gas and food for break at work,I have little left at the end of week
2011-03-06‎@nnaatteeks Ohh nooo, it's taken me quite a while. I started saving around Christmas Eve and it's taken me until now to save $455
2011-03-06‎@ArkhalowFilms And then you put the new stuff up and adjust the shelves and stuff, just a pain in the ass.
2011-03-06‎@ArkhalowFilms Yeah we build them every Saturday night. You strip what was on the display, work it to the shelf, and repack it.
2011-03-06‎@livinginthenorm Been a stressing week. Been swamped with schoolwork, which never happens. I have seven things to do by Monday.
2011-03-06‎But as soon as I get 300 more dollars I will have enough for a new computer. That day cant come soon enough  =(
2011-03-06‎"Because the other day I got a ""low memory"" notice and decided to check the drive on My Computer and said there was nothing on it. Damn haha"
2011-03-06‎So that means for the past two months I've had NOTHING on the drive at all. I thought new stuff automatically was saved to the drive.
2011-03-06‎haha wow so apparently when you get an external hard-drive you have to actually put stuff on it. Wow I feel like a dumbass.
2011-03-06‎@MrCrazyk33 Anytime  =)
2011-03-06‎And they are by far the biggest bitch to do. Shelves gotta be a certain space apart too. They just suck.
2011-03-06‎For those wondering what that picture was earlier, it is the diagram for end building(those displays at the end of aisles at grocery stores)

2011-03-03‎@makemebad35 Like always, Im not much fan of the change. I miss the border around the description box.
2011-03-03‎@makemebad35 I dont understand why every month they keep changing stuff. They will make one change and then change what they just did.
2011-03-03‎Im balancing so much school work right now, it's crazy. So much to do, so little time, ugh! This quarter is by far the most stressing.
2011-03-03‎@imatu777 He's out there I tell ya. Even sober he's fucked up now.

2011-02-22‎Just goes to show, like always, sequels arent usually good.
2011-02-22‎For one, the shots were so wide, it was hard to tell what to focus on. I guess if you watched on the big screen it'd look better.
2011-02-22‎Wow, all I can say was I was a little disappointed. First was way better. Did have some cool scenes but still...
2011-02-22‎@TheEllenShow Keep giving me laughs!
2011-02-22‎@Freakshow180 This was the coldest night I've had in a long time

2011-02-21‎Thank God it's a three day weekend! We also got 10 inches of snow, w00t! Time to snow blow.....  =/
2011-02-21‎The only advantage of being sick was I didnt go anywhere so I saved lots on gas and I got to miss two days of work.
2011-02-21‎@Freakshow180 The Steakhouse with the jalapenos in it. I tried it. It was a little too hot for me. Burnt my tongue by time I was done.Its ok

2011-02-18‎@imatu777 Yeah, used to have updates on for almost ten twitter users. Just got way too annoying.
2011-02-18‎@imatu777 What was really annoying was when twitter changed it to everyone on your contacts list. I hated that. I only have them on for mmb
2011-02-18‎@imatu777 Yeah I've really cut back. Especially because some had device updates on, which would really get annoying.
2011-02-18‎http://twitpic.com/40xqer - BlogTv makes me...smile?  =)

2011-02-15‎"@makemebad35 New video ""Demonic Activity"" - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSrInZHE2Zs  I can be pretty scary...."
2011-02-15‎"New video, ""Demonic Activity"" - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSrInZHE2Zs   This is by far verrry different than what I normally do, enjoy!"
2011-02-15‎Uploading now! Finally, after struggling with this problem for more than a week!
2011-02-15‎Yesss! I finally got movie maker to render! All I did was a disk cleanup and split the video into 2 parts and rendered separately! w00t!
2011-02-15‎@minchums17 I tried re-installing it the other day. Didnt work.
2011-02-15‎Theres no possible way to convert an MSWMM file to a wmv outside of movie maker. Ive searched for an online converter, NOTHING.
2011-02-15‎I still cant believe Movie Maker still isnt rendering my video, after a week and a half. I might re-edit it on my other PC.
2011-02-15‎@nnaatteeks Wasnt a fan of vanilla coke but dunno if I would think different of it today
2011-02-15‎Umm....typo? http://twitpic.com/3zxh2n
2011-02-15‎Forgot how amazing Cherry Coke is!
2011-02-14‎Ohhh the joys of procrastinating and finishing a long research paper at 2am. Gotta love it...
2011-02-14‎@Freakshow180 WTF? The turnitin doesnt even have an assignment for it....
2011-02-14‎@Freakshow180 Remember to use the turnitin website!
2011-02-14‎@Freakshow180 Hope you did it right!
2011-02-14‎@RADICALisaac You are awesome  =)
2011-02-14‎@livinginthenorm I am busy with a research paper that I have barely started. Might be up until 1am finishing it...

2011-02-13‎Rather be ABLE to edit than not at all
2011-02-13‎Okay so I have an interesting dillema. Do I spend the money Im saving up for a Mac OR a new camera? Should prob. go for the computer.

2011-02-11‎@makemebad35 I've been saving up for a mac but it's gonna take a few more months. Oh well, thanks for trying man

2011-02-11‎Ugh Im getting shocked by everything!
2011-02-11‎@makemebad35 Streamclip didnt recognize the MSWMM movie maker save file. Ugh this sucks! I dont know what else to do...
2011-02-11‎@livinginthenorm Not you haha
2011-02-11‎@AaronRodgers12 You guys are great though!
2011-02-11‎@AaronRodgers12 Thank you so much for knocking off Pittsburgh. Im a Cowboys fan and it means so much that they didnt get 7 Super Bowl wins
2011-02-11‎@LucasCruikshank Trust me there are people that post every five minutes that I follow
2011-02-11‎@justinbieber Made me lol when you gave @TheEllenShow a lock of your hair
2011-02-10‎Unless I upload with my web cam. This sucks so bad. Thanks for all of your suggestions the past week but none have worked sadly =(
2011-02-10‎So IDK what else to do. I hope that this works. If not I wont be able to upload videos until I get my Mac in a few months time.
2011-02-10‎I converted it to a RAR file & am sending it to another user. I have reinstalled Movie Maker & still nothing. Its ALL edited but cant upload
2011-02-10‎So I have one last attempt at this new video. It wont render and I cant put it on flash drive and open it on another computer,it doenst work
2011-02-09‎I think a girl at work likes me. Ohhhh booooyyy. Not the best way to have a relationship.
2011-02-09‎I cant put it onto another computer. You cant open a MSWMM file from a flash drive.
2011-02-09‎It's still getting stuck at 30% every time I try to render it. IDK what else to do. Ive also tried cutting it into 3 parts. Still nothing.
2011-02-09‎Well movie maker is still not working. I've tried reinstalling it, reconnecting my internet connection, and restarting the computer
2011-02-08‎@mightylions1 Let the spamming continue  =(
2011-02-08‎@imatu777 Really now lol
2011-02-08‎Hmm....  =) http://twitpic.com/3xlfxl
2011-02-08‎@RADICALisaac haha this video is very different than my usual stuff. Should surprise lots of viewers
2011-02-08‎Thanks for all of your suggestions. Trying some different things. See if it helps!
2011-02-08‎RT @TheEllenShow: Sorry you guys. I’ll cut it out. http://twitpic.com/3xknfh
2011-02-07‎Help! Can you help with this problem? Ughhhh - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-itoUnrjkFY
2011-02-07‎@RADICALisaac Yeahh!
2011-02-07‎@SmoshIan Were you rooting for anybody?
2011-02-07‎@Freakshow180 Hell yeah!
2011-02-07‎@TheEllenShow Now that guy has to wear that Packer gear you got him lol
2011-02-07‎@makemebad35 When PIT creeps back they usually win. Havent seen their offense so terrible in the first half like that in a while.
2011-02-07‎@makemebad35 I admit though when PIT had the ball for the last time I thought they were gonna drive 2 the endzone.Being it was only 6pt game
2011-02-07‎@smpfilms lol you missed it
2011-02-07‎Cowboys are the only team to beat PIT in the SB and it's ironic they lose IN Dallas. Awesome feeling. Did not want them getting 7 SB wins.
2011-02-07‎@makemebad35 My best friend at the time had sucked me into the Packers. So I was a 'Boys and Packers fan. But Cowboys were still fav.
2011-02-07‎Go cry about it Pittsburgh! Go Pack go! Well deserved! No 7 for you guys!!!!
2011-02-07‎Alright we asked for a show. Crunch time. Come on Rodgers, tear 'em up!
2011-02-07‎That was huge for GB. 28-17  Keep it going! Go Pack go!
2011-02-07‎@RADICALisaac lol!
2011-02-07‎@Nighty74 I lol'd just looking in my mirror
2011-02-07‎http://twitpic.com/3x9mho - I had to break out my 10 year old Packers jersey. Look how small it is! Medium Size 10 -12 X( @makemebad35
2011-02-07‎@makemebad35 Cant believe how bad Ben's fucking up. Im lovin' it  =)  Pack get the ball in 2nd half so hope they capitalize
2011-02-06‎Yet again, it's stuck at 30%, WHY?! This makes no sense. Ugh, so pissed.
2011-02-06‎Now it wont even let me get to the render portion. This is really pissing me off.
2011-02-06‎Im not willing to put every thing on flash drive and transfer to my other PC. Takes over an hour. I just need to render!
2011-02-06‎Movie Maker does NOT want me to upload this video. It wont even let me convert the file. It's in the MSWMM (or whatever it is) format
2011-02-06‎Super Bowl Sunday! Come on cheese heads, the only time Im gonna root for you. PIT MUST FALL!
2011-02-06‎Well this isnt good. It keeps getting stuck at 30%, even on a different setting. Might have to use my other computer for this one  =(
2011-02-06‎@imatu777 Do you not sleep?
2011-02-06‎@synthplaya Bad move lol
2011-02-06‎So I was rendering my video overnight in HD and when I wake up, it is stuck at 30% with 1414 minutes remaining. Better try a diff. setting..
2011-02-06‎@Freakshow180 lmao! That is hilarious.
2011-02-06‎I seriously am getting some chills watching it lol this is some freaky shit. Will be uploading tomorrow. I am actually scaring myself.
2011-02-06‎My new video can seriously give you nightmares. This video is really crazy. I've never made anything like this video before.
2011-02-06‎@makemebad35 It would be funny b/c the Cowboys are the only team to beat PIT in  Super Bowl. To have them lose IN Dallas would be awesome.
2011-02-06‎@makemebad35 Big game's tomorrow.Lets hope the Pack send the Steelers home crying. Want fans to finally shut up about Stairway to Seven  X(
2011-02-06‎The inside of my Stouffer's tv dinner box smells like brand new carpetting
2011-02-05‎So after 7 months I am going to get a haircut Tuesday. It needs to be done.
2011-02-05‎@4hand561 Just the basic Compaq computer. Nothing special. Windows XP
2011-02-05‎@RADICALisaac I cant, sorry gotta edit my new video
2011-02-05‎http://twitpic.com/3wkta3 - My new video has corrupted me
2011-02-05‎@4hand561 Not into laptops. Need the desktop.
2011-02-05‎Just filmed a new video. Good God this one will be strange for sure. By far different than my usual stuff. I scared myself making this one.
2011-02-04‎I do need a new computer and have been saving up for an iMac but am still roughly $700 shy. Cant get the money soon enough  =(
2011-02-04‎So I come to find its my computer thats sucking ass not blogtv. Had to end it. I will use my other pc next time. Had it with this shit.
2011-02-04‎Live for a bit - http://www.blogtv.com/people/PioneersProductionsBlog
2011-02-04‎Live @ 8pm ET. lets hope blogtv will be kind
2011-02-03‎They def. could see it out. It's a long wide road. Got away with this one.
2011-02-03‎The headlight on my passenger side is dead out. And they were sitting on the left shoulder. Same area where I got my ticket before.Got lucky
2011-02-03‎They stop you for everything & I mean EVERYTHING. I got a ticket for tailgating once. Besides the point but it's near dark & its out
2011-02-03‎God loves me! On my way home from my college class,the township police that pull you over for EVERYTHING didnt stop me for the headlight out
2011-02-03‎@makemebad35 My tongue was shot after I ate that. Sprite tasted burnt but it was awesome.
2011-02-03‎Eating McDonalds in  Burger King parking lot. It feels like a sin. lol  BK is better though.
2011-02-03‎@makemebad35 Wasnt I right? lol
2011-02-03‎My stomach just growled and it sounded possessed. Especially with it being dead silent in here, it scared the shit outta me.
2011-02-03‎@makemebad35 I see you still havent gotten to them, haha jk just saw you replied. Sorry if I was a pain lol
2011-02-03‎@Freakshow180 Steelers and Eagles = BAD   =)
2011-02-03‎@RADICALisaac Def. the Packers. Steelers are my 2nd least favorite team (Eagles). It would be like Christmas morning to see them choke.
2011-02-03‎Just great not just a cut a gash.I didnt even feel it until minutes later when I saw blood dripping on the floor(sorry if any are squeamish)
2011-02-03‎So I was closing the back of a grocery truck and there was an icicle on the strap and it slit a small gash in my finger.
2011-02-03‎Dinner at work. Usually what I have when Im there which is every other day. http://twitpic.com/3vx23f
2011-02-03‎@4hand561 lol someone already did it for me
2011-02-02‎Today is just miserable, is it not? Cloudy, rainy, and icy. Also with it being dead at work.
2011-02-02‎@Nighty74 Thanks much man  =)
2011-02-02‎Can anyone make my YouTube banner transparent so you can see the background layout but still see the pictures and text on the banner?
2011-02-02‎@4hand561 haha I hope GB destroys them
2011-02-02‎@makemebad35 I see you didnt get to the questions. That's okay.
2011-02-02‎@DeniseVlogs I went without a computer for a week and felt my existence fading away. Mobile Web just doesnt do it.
2011-02-02‎I dreamed that the Steelers lost the Super Bowl, ughhh if only it was true! PIT MUST FALL!

2011-02-01‎@makemebad35 Only thing I hate is drinking soda with Jalapenos. Like the new Steakhouse Jalapeno burger at BK. Burns your taste-buds lol

2011-01-31‎@RADICALisaac I've currently made roughly $80 since I got partnered last October, sooo not much.
2011-01-31‎@RADICALisaac Not that much. Need more views. Takes time building up an audience. But if you get up there, money can be a great investment
2011-01-31‎@PointBaron It took me nearly two and a half years. Every user is different though. Not sure what they look for. Mostly views.You got a shot
2011-01-31‎@MrCrazyk33 Just in time for Groundhog Day  haha
2011-01-31‎"@makemebad35 ""Today is the day I will finally beat Gator Golf""  22 years and you still havent beaten it?"

2011-01-30‎@Destorm Happy birthday!
2011-01-30‎@livinginthenorm Didnt stop me at all. Especially I was shocked because I was coming up on the school zone. That really shocked me.
2011-01-30‎@livinginthenorm I've gotten away with traffic violations plenty of times. Most were speeding. Like when I went 50 in a 35 and the trooper
2011-01-30‎@RADICALisaac I have X-Box 360
2011-01-29‎For one thing, troopers dont care as much for little stuff like that but still. Caught a break. Cant afford another ticket.
2011-01-29‎In all irony, I dont stop complete & I have a headlight out and a state trooper was right behind me when I pulled out. Phew. Passenger light
2011-01-29‎Check out this collab I did with Grant, def. crazy! - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umH3ZRB3iXc&feature=feedu

2011-01-27‎But for some reason with the cable,all footage get's imported. Def. helps now! I used to have as many as 8 folders instead of 1 with footage
2011-01-27‎The reason I say that is because the flashdrive I used that you stick the card into always missed files when I imported.
2011-01-27‎Wow, so for the past year and a half never knew I had a USB cable for my camera (one always comes with a camera).
2011-01-27‎@RADICALisaac So whichever sends first, sends first.

2011-01-16‎TruTv's World's Dummest would be so much better without the lameass commentary by those celebrities. I could do better than that.
2011-01-16‎@smoshanthony I havent laughed so hard at one of your guys videos in a long time. Def. one of your best!
2011-01-15‎@IsaacRojas123 Yeah lol it was a self-portrait project.

2011-01-15‎@householdhacker It's never too late  =)
2011-01-15‎@IsaacRojas123 It would be confusing switching between the two
2011-01-15‎@IsaacRojas123 Dont think UStream is the best. For one all of the viewers dont have an account. It would confuse people
2011-01-15‎@blogTV Cant connect to chat and frequent lag and freeze with video stream. Cant connect sometimes either.
2011-01-15‎Well Live show's not going down tonight. BlogTv's still causing problems. Cant even get in the chat. Bummer....

2011-01-14‎@imatu777 There was a little mishap back in 2008 that resulted in us closing the original Fatass account (FatassTVcrew)
2011-01-14‎So UStream didnt turn out so well. Damn BlogTv. I will make it up tomorrow night, 8pm ET on BlogTv. Should be fixed by then. Sorry  =/

2010-12-06‎@makemebad35 Congrats once again to your Raiders  =)
2010-12-06‎@yosoyian It was a damn good win. Started to lose it but we hung in there and shut down Manning.
2010-12-06‎@kungfualice Hope we did. So sick of them dominating every year in the AFC. Time to pass the torch.
2010-12-06‎Well what a win for the Cowboys! So happy we knocked off Indy. Nothing to play for but def. feels good  =)
2010-12-06‎@kungfualice I thought we blew it when we fumbled the kickoff lol w00t! What a win  =)
2010-12-05‎It's also 30 degrees outside with wind chill that freezes your brain. Feels like it's 0 degrees out there.
2010-12-05‎Whats sucks more is I worked 3-10 last night, got home and went right to bed, woke up and Im back here at work at 9 AM. Fuckin excellent =(
2010-12-05‎"Today is just never ending at work. We had our grand re-opening. Working 9-4 and Im just praying for my phone to read ""3:55 PM"""
2010-12-05‎Chest nuts taste just like baked potatoes!  =)
2010-12-05‎@makemebad35 I've never had smoothies much, which is probably why I didnt like the Naked drinks at first
2010-12-05‎@makemebad35 I believe it was the Power-C machine. That one was too strong it seemed. IDK but the blueberry one reminded me of yogurt  =D
2010-12-05‎Thanks for the help with the hyperlinking!  =)
2010-12-05‎@makemebad35 Like those drinks lol but that one's okay. It's something different.
2010-12-05‎@makemebad35 So after not liking one of them, I tried the blue machine Naked drink and it's actually okay. At first I was like how do you
2010-12-05‎Watch if you're a man! - @freakshow180 's video  --&gt; http://youtu.be/2uBqsgf_Ja8
2010-12-05‎@imatu777 IDK how to use that
2010-12-05‎@IsaacRojas123 I know lol maybe a RT here and there
2010-12-05‎@qxvz Alrighty
2010-12-05‎Congrats to @smosh on 2 million subscribers! @smoshanthony @smoshian

2010-12-05‎@imatu777 You wish =P
2010-12-05‎@IsaacRojas123 Thanks man! Looks awesome  =)
2010-12-05‎Only half way done with the vid though. This is a bit different than my other videos.
2010-12-05‎Today I did probably the grossest scene Ive ever done. Youll see in the new video this week.
2010-12-04‎@smoshanthony @SmoshIan Cant believe you guys are about to hit 2 million subscribers. Congrats guys, you deserve every one of 'em  =)
2010-12-04‎@Freakshow180 Props on the new video lol
2010-12-03‎@livinginthenorm lol
2010-12-03‎Ahh toe cramp! Gahhmotherfuckahhhow!
2010-12-02‎@PointBaron IDK if the format has anything to do with it. But I doubt you'd want to waist time re-rendering it. Ask in the help forums.
2010-12-02‎@PointBaron And try using a different output format like mov or even flv. Because if avi isnt working, thats your best bet.
2010-12-02‎@smpfilms One day and you're done already? You got lucky lol
2010-12-02‎@PointBaron For some reason, Fred's new character Doug reminds me of you. It seems like your style in a way.
2010-12-02‎@Freakshow180 I liked their fries more than their burgers
2010-12-02‎If not I can finish it up Friday. Want to try to put one out every other week from now on but no promises. Would be nice though.
2010-12-02‎Filming a new video tomorrow. Hope I get it done in two hours  :X
2010-12-02‎TV dinners should come with forks/knives.

2010-11-26‎@CyberAceTV You gotta be crazy to go shopping on Black Friday haha SLEEP!
2010-11-26‎Well Cowboys are done for the season. Guess it's for the best since we've had so many problems this year, but it's a new direction.
2010-11-25‎@CyberAceTV We eat early. Only a couple times when the Cowboys game starts but yeah, we eat around 1:30

2010-11-24‎@IsaacRojas123 When you get the chance remember you have to modify that banner a tad
2010-11-23‎Go away pimple! Nobody likes you but you always like me...fuck you
2010-11-23‎@makemebad35 Around Vidcon you were down and out for a while b/c it was when we collabed
2010-11-23‎@makemebad35 At least it was after the Raiders game.
2010-11-23‎@makemebad35 Thats twice for you this year?  I got a flu shot. So far so good. Usually around March it will hit me hard. Get well man.
2010-11-22‎*Bows head for JFK*
2010-11-21‎@kungfualice Cowboys win 35-19!!!
2010-11-21‎@makemebad35 Sorry about your Raiders, wild game nonetheless though! Hope it was worth the while. Fuck Pittsburgh!
2010-11-21‎Holy christ, how 'bout Roethlisberger getting busted  in the chops!  @makemebad35
2010-11-21‎@makemebad35 And we get a huge touchdown. I always miss it! lol  but guarantee you'll love it.
2010-11-21‎@makemebad35 Yeah really flies especially half time. Past two times, I just go to get food and 2nd half starts. Waiting in line
2010-11-21‎@makemebad35 It's nice not having to listen to announcers for a change. Where are your seats?
2010-11-21‎@makemebad35 Hope you enjoy it though, being that you've never gone to a game yet. It moves so much quicker than TV.
2010-11-21‎@imatu777 Very true, they may rot in hell lol
2010-11-21‎@makemebad35 Just dont abuse the towel and you will be fine lol brings bad luck
2010-11-21‎@makemebad35 I've never been to Pittsburgh but be prepared to be surrounded my thousands of Terrible Towels. Fucking hate those things.
2010-11-21‎@makemebad35 Wear it so you dont regret it.
2010-11-21‎No money = no dinner  :X  Luckily my favorite co-worker spotted me a few bucks. Dumped some displays and such. Just a bad night  =(
2010-11-21‎Tonight was just one of those nights. Bad luck. All started when I forgot my wallet when I went to work.
2010-11-20‎Just bowled a 255 in my league today!  X X X X X X X 8/ X 9/8

2010-11-19‎"My dad went to see him and he actually joked saying ""Well at least we know the saw works"". He's fucked up man."
2010-11-19‎He cant use two of his fingers and both arms were cut. It's pretty bad. Dunno whats going to happen though.
2010-11-19‎Well went to see my grandma today and she's holding up alright. Still cant believe what had happened but she's fine.
2010-11-19‎@livinginthenorm Yeah, extra careful for a year :X

2010-11-19‎@livinginthenorm Six
2010-11-19‎@smpfilms I never understood it why they would do that on YouTube. The screen isnt big enough for the illusion.
2010-11-19‎So apparently I got 3pts taken off of my license for that tailgating ticket. If I get another ticket, I lose my license FUCK! This is so gay
2010-11-19‎@DeniseVlogs Awful cooking lol
2010-11-19‎He took a knife and slit part of his throat and my 81 year old grandmother actually wrestled it off of him and it broke, with the blade in
2010-11-18‎@Freakshow180 No sorry lol
2010-11-18‎@IsaacRojas123 I mean, you could if you wanted to. I might stick to the one I have but go for it & I changed the title before the vid was up
2010-11-18‎@IsaacRojas123 And you dont need to do that haha Just viewing it helps
2010-11-18‎@IsaacRojas123 Call me crazy but I havent seen any ads on vids in like a month but Partner Support says they're there. WTF is going on?
2010-11-18‎"@makemebad35 New vid, ""Mr. Horse Head Returns"" - http://bit.ly/dC72b2"
2010-11-18‎Gah! Just hit myself in the knee so hard with a crate of water and my knee cap just felt like it was hit with a sledgehammer! Gahhhh!
2010-11-18‎@Arkhalow That would be a weird story lol
2010-11-17‎Already 9 year old girls want cell phones . Wow lol
2010-11-17‎Haha wow, just realized a year ago this Friday will be the anniversary of the first Mr. Horse Head video. Good timing I suppose lol
2010-11-17‎"New video! ""Mr. Horse Head Returns"" - http://bit.ly/bpNtkp  He returns with a grudge"
2010-11-17‎@davedays It's not that scary of a movie but when you hear things go bump in the night, it gets to you
2010-11-17‎But who am I to judge. Usually vids of mine that I hate usually fare well with everyone else. We shall see!
2010-11-17‎Just gotta add some music and the video is done. It's an okay video, not the best but at least I got one done. Uploading tomorrow afternoon.
2010-11-17‎So I had to buy an external hard drive because my computer has virtually no space left because of iTunes. $50 but will be worth it.
2010-11-17‎@Freakshow180 Just turned it off, phew
2010-11-17‎Wtf?! Im getting zillions of @replies from my followers sent to my phone!
2010-11-16‎Nooo! Where the fuck are the seeds on my Big Mac?! http://twitpic.com/37gg1b
2010-11-16‎I will upload tomorrow afternoon because it would be around midnight if I were to upload tonight.
2010-11-16‎Haha well crap turns out I have to fill in for someone at work tonight so I cant put the finishing touches on the new video.
2010-11-16‎@iFahmi13 Yes, I use it for the second channel
2010-11-16‎@DeniseVlogs That's a pretty....bad logo :X
2010-11-16‎@iFahmi13 Flips are great except for the zoom but def. worth purchasing
2010-11-16‎@imatu777 Turns out it was the sixth Burglar video. That was a year before Jack was killed off.
2010-11-16‎Here's one final 2008 clip - http://youtu.be/245Z_d1Wg6s  If you thought the past two were weird @makemebad35
2010-11-16‎This one is 4 minutes long so good way to close it out. Gonna take a while to upload though.
2010-11-16‎Uploading one final clip just because I think it's retarded lol stay tuned
2010-11-16‎Happy birthday @Freakshow180  Happy 18th!
2010-11-16‎@IsaacRojas123 That sucks bro! No problem, take your time.
2010-11-16‎@Freakshow180 Funny or suspense? lol
2010-11-16‎@makemebad35 Do you see why I've deleted my old 2008 videos? lol I was 15 back then. I can only imagine your vids if YOU were 15 lol
2010-11-16‎@Freakshow180 Could happen though because I can upload unlimited video time now
2010-11-16‎@Freakshow180 Im not sure I can even make that voice anymore hahaha that would be some movie
2010-11-16‎@Freakshow180 Dont even go there lol
2010-11-16‎Here's one last clip - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7f39x5qJcDk   Read the description. This is clip 2/2
2010-11-16‎@imatu777 I knew YOU would lol
2010-11-16‎Uploading two more old clips, unlisted.You will have to check the description of the first clip to view them. Cant believe Im doing this lol
2010-11-16‎@livinginthenorm I dont see your message?
2010-11-16‎@IsaacRojas123 Def. will post tomorrow. Gonna be up late finishing it up. Gotta free up space.
2010-11-16‎@IsaacRojas123 Im trying to get it done but I am virtually out of free space on my computer so I am removing stuff, hence the old videos lol
2010-11-16‎@imatu777 Plus the camera was a Sony Handycam. It was like a 2002 edition so not the best software back then lol
2010-11-16‎@imatu777 I dont have the finished products and the importing software I used back then didnt import the full clips.
2010-11-16‎Here's the 2008 footage. You might never look at me the same way after watching this lol - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Hxc8ff7m8s
2010-11-16‎@Freakshow180 Welcome to the 18 club
2010-11-16‎@livinginthenorm No, that was a video I actually still had posted until recently. This is from mid-July 2008.
2010-11-16‎@kungfualice How long have you been a fan?
2010-11-16‎Looked up files with a large size and somehow they were removed the computer two years ago so Im uploading and then deleting forever
2010-11-16‎One reason I am showing you this is because I have virtually no free space left on my hard drive so I had to get rid of shit.
2010-11-16‎I cant believe how bad this footage is, it's crazy. You might never look at me the same again once you see this old video footage from 2008
2010-11-16‎Uploading some 2008 footage, UNLISTED so once the first one is posted, I will add links to the description bar of the first video
2010-11-16‎@livinginthenorm I was actually 15 when that was filmed
2010-11-16‎Holy shit, I somehow still have video footage from 2008 on my computer. I will post a pic of myself from 2008 from a video.Might even upload
2010-11-15‎Also putting the finishing touches on the new video. Probably wont be up tonight but def. tomorrow.
2010-11-15‎Im probably way behind on this but I never knew you can hook your flashdrive into your X-BOX & watch your videos and such on there. Amazing!
2010-11-15‎@kungfualice Guess the coaching change was for the better. It would be nice to win out to be (9-7)
2010-11-15‎@imatu777 Dark sits in your mouth longer and makes you thirstier. Usually one piece is enough for me
2010-11-15‎@imatu777 Depends, milk chocolate I guess
2010-11-15‎@makemebad35 Both of which I cant stand. Hate both teams. Lucky your Raiders turned around just in time the past few weeks
2010-11-15‎@makemebad35 And yes, it's nice to finally win a game again. Being in PA, I live in Eagle and Steeler country, two very hot teams right now
2010-11-15‎@makemebad35 Wow lots of time for a 10 minute short. Gotta be stressing :X  Then again, it takes a few hours for even a 2 minute video
2010-11-15‎@makemebad35 How long is the film gonna be?
2010-11-15‎So my Cowboys crushed the G-men. Now why couldnt we do that from the start of the season?  =)
2010-11-14‎Help??? http://twitpic.com/36xncy
2010-11-14‎@smpfilms Where did you go? I was wondering why you havent been posting videos.
2010-11-14‎@shanedawson When you were laughing at the end you sounded like you were being choked and laughing at the same time lmao!
2010-11-14‎@CyberAceTV What part of PA were you in?
2010-11-14‎@iFahmi13 It glitches a lot. Dont worry about it.
2010-11-14‎Think I finally got it to work. Converting overnight, editing tomorrow, and uploading Monday. That's the hope.
2010-11-14‎This video is giving me so much stress because everytime I go to import or convert it, says I dont have enough free disk space.
2010-11-13‎Look and theres a spider crawling on my pants, wtf?
2010-11-13‎Found this written on the truck tonight. Hmm.... http://twitpic.com/36bleo

2010-11-12‎New video was filmed today! Should be up by Sunday.

2010-11-06‎I had a nightmare that I was being shot at by a sniper & in the end it hit me right in the arm where I got my flu shot yesterday. I felt it!
2010-11-05‎@makemebad35 Also sent you some questions to your inbox
2010-11-05‎@imatu777 lmao!
2010-11-05‎@buckhollywood Youre so close to 1 million subs!
2010-11-05‎@shanedawson Epic Halloween video man, must have taken lots of time to make
2010-11-05‎@imatu777 Get a new computer lol
2010-11-05‎@Arkhalow I've had a clean record through grade school so far. Not one detention or suspension.
2010-11-05‎@makemebad35 I never knew it was possible. I saw the cop wiggle to pull out and thought fuck. Glad I wasnt speeding. You ever get a ticket?
2010-11-04‎I still cant believe I got a ticket lol Well one of my biggest fears has been crossed off
2010-11-04‎@synthplaya Sorry I missed it  =X
2010-11-04‎@makemebad35 I dont understand the point of the enlarged view counter, it was fine before
2010-11-04‎Got pulled over today for following a car too close.  $109.00  fuck me

2010-11-03‎@IsaacRojas123 Hey, question. For that banner for my channel, can you change the picture of me to my Facebook pic? Just updated my pic.
2010-11-03‎@Arkhalow Lol I was getting a little nervous
2010-11-03‎A video of me last year in German class with @Freakshow180 - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w0HYzCt3VJ4   Vaguely remember filming this lol
2010-11-03‎@Freakshow180 Thats back when your hair was a bush lol
2010-11-03‎@IsaacRojas123 Thats fine, I can have synthplaya hyperlink it.
2010-11-03‎@Freakshow180 Upload it!
2010-11-03‎I hope Im not getting sick. My throat and head are hurting pretty bad  :X
2010-11-03‎So I downloaded more effects for Movie Maker & they turned out great...EXCEPT FOR THE FUCKING 'X' in the middle! - http://bit.ly/boDZGg
2010-11-03‎Anyone know how to get rid of it? It's one of those effect fun packs from microsoft.
2010-11-03‎@makemebad35 I thought it was a marker to show the middle of the screen. Once again, free stuff screws you.
2010-11-03‎This makes no sense. It isnt a demo or trial or anything. Gotta find another source I guess  =/
2010-11-03‎Okay I might have found a software to remove the watermark. Wish me luck!
2010-11-02‎My co-worker was in a horrific car crash last week. He came back today. Has knee and chest pains. His car? Absolutely totalled.
2010-11-02‎He was only going 20mph around a turn that wasnt tight, fishtailed and hit a tree off an enbankment. The wreck made the newspaper.
2010-11-02‎Always makes you think that your next drive could be your last. Glad he's virtually unhurt. It would be dreadfull to have a new friend pass.
2010-11-02‎@Arkhalow Damn dude, dont even know what to say about that. Sorry for your loss ='(  I've been fortunate.
2010-11-02‎@IsaacRojas123 What???
2010-11-02‎"Almost got pulled over for speeding in a school zone by my college. The ""15mph when flashing"" was on and a cop went right by me."
2010-11-02‎I was going roughly 30 and the limit alone through there is 25 when school isnt a factor. I got lucky is all I can say. Guess I looked slow
2010-11-02‎Hard to go that slow through there, feels like 5mph. Feel like  I got a second chance....maybe an omen?  =X
2010-11-02‎Live at 8pm ET

2010-11-01‎@IsaacRojas123 Uploading now
2010-11-01‎"New video on second channel - ""BK Breakfast Bowl"" - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZg1L-_KtXo"
2010-11-01‎@IsaacRojas123 A music video?? Not my style lol cant sing for shit
2010-10-31‎I just sneezed wicked hard and now my throat hurts....I just stopped driving in the middle of the road to post this...
2010-10-31‎So many great Halloween vids out there. Great work @shanedawson @makemebad35 @twelthofadime
2010-10-31‎What I might do Wednesday night is just do my video then and upload it as a late Halloween vid. We'll see, I just dont know.
2010-10-31‎Im off three nights in a row this week from work so theres a good chance.
2010-10-31‎New second channel vid tonight
2010-10-31‎@makemebad35 Sent you a DM, when you get the chance
2010-10-31‎Only thing I hate about the Flip is it uses MP4. Movie Maker cant import that. When I convert it, the quality is shittier.
2010-10-31‎I go to my importer for my other camera but it always leaves out files when I import them. It sucks  =(
2010-10-31‎"@imatu777 Ive been using ""Any Video Converter"" but am now trying different ones like MP4cam2Avi"
2010-10-31‎@imatu777 The Flipshare program doesnt have preferences to change exporting formats. It's all Mp4, all the time.
2010-10-31‎@imatu777 But I mean this MP42Avi program is converting a hell of a lot faster than AVC. We'll see.
2010-10-31‎@kungfualice Congrats! Thats awesome  =D
2010-10-31‎@imatu777 Going to try handbrake
2010-10-31‎@shanedawson Awesome Halloween video man. That was by far your best interactive one. Keep it up man!
2010-10-31‎@imatu777 Says it will take over four hours  :X
2010-10-31‎@imatu777 11 minutes
2010-10-30‎@livinginthenorm Nigahiga
2010-10-30‎I fell asleep last night before I could film. Oh well, maybe next year for Halloween  =P
2010-10-30‎@JaelenTruongTV Youre not alone  =(
2010-10-30‎RT @Freakshow180: Hey @pioneersprod fans! Heres a pic of his parking spot :P http://twitpic.com/32b4pf
2010-10-30‎@makemebad35 Fine tune? What does that mean?
2010-10-30‎In darkness http://twitpic.com/321310
2010-10-30‎Tonight is my absolute last shot to get a Halloween video done. I would import over night and edit tomorrow. Lets pray!
2010-10-30‎@Freakshow180 But Im a stock clerk lol
2010-10-30‎Okay @YouTube is really glitchy. It says @smosh is #1 Most Subscribed - http://www.youtube.com/smosh
2010-10-29‎Oh boy this is it. I have only tonight to reshoot. If I fail, no Halloween video  :X  Want it up Saturday night.
2010-10-29‎@livinginthenorm Thanks! I need it  :X
2010-10-29‎Good colors? http://twitpic.com/31q3x9
2010-10-29‎@Arkhalow Thanks
2010-10-29‎@imatu777 =P
2010-10-29‎My night is consisting of Last House on the Left and Paranormal Activity so far. Maybe some Friday the 13th before filming?
2010-10-29‎@livinginthenorm Im waiting for everyone to go to sleep?
2010-10-29‎Its not happenin' guys. Sorry.  ='(    This is so stressing. Ever since partnership, I havent done anything
2010-10-29‎I am so pissed at myself right now. Planning weeks in advance for this and failing every time. Its been almost two months since a video.
2010-10-29‎@PointBaron lol thanks
2010-10-29‎Congrats @YouTube on 1 billion subscriptions  =O
2010-10-29‎Now Ive seen everything http://twitpic.com/3203sh
2010-10-28‎This is how bad the truck was at work tonight. Couldnt get the jacks in! http://twitpic.com/31gyn3
2010-10-28‎"You have to life that metal rusted bar in the middle and put it in the truck to get to the pallets. We couldnt do it b/c of these ""shippers"""
2010-10-28‎Before we opened it, the truck door was bulging out b/c of how full it was. Couldnt even lift the hatch up!
2010-10-28‎There was also another shipper (Those tall box displays) in there. It was removed before this picture.
2010-10-28‎Those shippers weigh over 100 lbs.
2010-10-27‎Oh boy, I have the urge to make two Halloween videos. One actually funny/scary. I mean the one I made is funny but really just has no story.
2010-10-27‎@imatu777 I havent even asked for submissions yet lol not sure. Want to get my Halloween video out and then the Texas video.
2010-10-27‎The only thing is, I want it to be realistic but not have the video drag on in length.
2010-10-27‎I mean I can do both and put one on one channel and vise versa. Lots of work but I might do it. Only have one day to do it though :X
2010-10-27‎@makemebad35 It was actually 70 here today. That's a shock for almost November :X
2010-10-27‎Yeah now that I look back on this, this video is a complete fail.I have to make a different one.Im up against the clock but know I can do it
2010-10-27‎@IsaacRojas123 So much to edit through though lol
2010-10-27‎@imatu777 It was more fun to do than to watch. IDK, it just moves too fast and is probably only a minute long.
2010-10-27‎I have officially deleted the footage. I have an idea of a different Halloween video. Dark, yet funny, which the previous wasnt; just funny.
2010-10-27‎"@livinginthenorm It just was. I mean it was kinda funny because the ""killer"" was falling over the furniture and such but it just didnt work"
2010-10-27‎"Want to see what I did wrong in ""Torture"" last summer? Check out @imatu777 's video that critique's my errors lol - http://bit.ly/cZEUgI"
2010-10-27‎@makemebad35 Check your DMs if you get the chance. Asked you a question the other night.
2010-10-26‎Well what do ya know, Romo out for the season. Just another fall into the depths of dispair as a Cowboys fan  =(
2010-10-25‎@makemebad35 Holy shit your Raiders kicked ass!
2010-10-25‎@livinginthenorm If I fix this importing problem, Im hoping midweek or Friday
2010-10-24‎@synthplaya Ah sorry I missed it. I had work until ten
2010-10-24‎Haha, well crap, I was just about to import my footage and it says Im low on space. Thats a problem  :X
2010-10-24‎@shanedawson Get up ya bum! lol
2010-10-24‎"If anyone has an XBOX Live account, I am buying a new Halo 3 game again today b/c it's been broken for months. Not really up for ""Reach"""
2010-10-24‎I will tell you my gamertag later. Off to the mall lol
2010-10-24‎@CyberAceTV It seems to have a more COD touch to it which Im not a fan of. Plus I am not on Live much.
2010-10-24‎@CyberAceTV Also didnt want to pay sixty bucks for it :X
2010-10-24‎Im like the walking-dead today. Being tired and at work = NO FUN
2010-10-23‎I wonder what he's thinking... http://twitpic.com/2zxszh
2010-10-23‎I cant believe how sore I am from this video. I banged my knee off of the corner of the end table and it cramped my toes :X
2010-10-23‎Hope to edit it this weekend and get it up by mid-week? Also took a good shot to the chest filming this. Im very sore.
2010-10-23‎@Arkhalow lol I actually didnt use one this time
2010-10-23‎@Arkhalow haha careful man! Yeah I've used them in the past like last years Halloween video and such but actually didnt this year.
2010-10-23‎@Arkhalow I went for the more comedic approach this time. IDK we'll see if it was a good decision.
2010-10-22‎Halloween video was filmed. Man am I sore! Hope it turned out okay.
2010-10-21‎Might go Live tonight. Stay tuned!
2010-10-21‎Live 8pm ET - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ab-ZNnPhYv8   @youtube seems to be plaing the 0% publish game  =/

2010-10-21‎@imatu777 lol wow is all I can say
2010-10-21‎Going to try to upload some of the footage I got from Texas two weeks ago when I went to the Cowboys game. Turns out I have enough for a vid
2010-10-21‎Hope to get it up this weekend on the second channel. Focusing on the Halloween video for now though.
2010-10-21‎@makemebad35 Yo Damian, have some questions for you to answer. You've been so busy the past week you never got to them so @reply me back

2010-10-20‎Filming my Halloween video tomorrow!
2010-10-20‎@makemebad35 Thats what they pay you for; to hit people while playing the game. Theyre paid millions for that

2010-10-20‎@CyberAceTV lol thanks man
2010-10-20‎@makemebad35 You need to go Live sometime!

2010-10-18‎@Freakshow180 I hate every PHI sports team but once in a while I will root for the Phillies
2010-10-18‎Just realized I had an old Facebook account that had 5 friend requests on it. It's a dead account lol made it to test to see
2010-10-18‎"What my regular profile page looked like lol turns out it was actually called ""Randy Stair"" and you guys were confused XD Just deleted it"
2010-10-18‎Well I made a new MySpace account (I know right?) and I am not happy with the new layout. So confusing and cant even change my URL username
2010-10-18‎For example myspace.com/randyhasamyspace    I cant edit the myspace.com/553397694
2010-10-18‎@makemebad35 I made a new myspace and it's so confusing now! Cant stand the new layout. I had an account a year ago but deleted it last year
2010-10-18‎Dont bother sending friend requests, I just deactivated it
2010-10-18‎@livinginthenorm IDK, felt like making one again but was very disappointed
2010-10-18‎@smoshanthony Guarantee over 100 just retweeted that tweet lol
2010-10-18‎@makemebad35 Been a few days, can you do ?'s   I just resent and changed a few
2010-10-18‎@makemebad35 How does that work? But congrats man!
2010-10-17‎@IsaacRojas123 Thanks for making the banners! I am only picking certain ones.

2010-10-17‎@imatu777 w00t
2010-10-17‎@IsaacRojas123 The channel banner is great but IDK if you can hyperlink the images to the pages?
2010-10-17‎I officially give up hope on the Cowboys this season. We suck dick.
2010-10-17‎@kungfualice So I hear you're a Cowboys fan. Feeling your pain =/
2010-10-16‎@makemebad35 What the flying fuck?!
2010-10-16‎@makemebad35 Also can you do those ?'s since youre in your inbox?
2010-10-16‎I was taking the garbage out at work and thought I saw a cat. About 10ft from it I realized OH SHIT IT'S A SKUNK! Backed away in time =X
2010-10-16‎Also just got partial wardrobe for my Halloween video  =)
2010-10-16‎@imatu777 All I can say about that video response is WHAT THE FUCK??

2010-10-14‎@synthplaya Oh, the banners lol
2010-10-14‎Why are people on @YouTube losing partnership for no reason?!
2010-10-14‎@livinginthenorm No, I havent
2010-10-14‎@PointBaron Jaelentruong
2010-10-14‎@qxvz It was Jaelentruong
2010-10-14‎@qxvz It is more than one user. Hundreds have lost their partnership for no reason
2010-10-14‎@makemebad35 Dont know if your busy or not but resent the questions just now
2010-10-14‎@qxvz Over the past weeks
2010-10-13‎@makemebad35 Sent you some questions to your inbox, when you get the chance.
2010-10-13‎@jaelentruong Ah, not really ready to have two partnered channels. Plus I already have a copyright (technically) on the Nightmare vid.
2010-10-13‎@IsaacRojas123 Competition between you and @synthplaya lol
2010-10-13‎@imatu777 Why not?
2010-10-13‎@twelthofadime Nice collab with ganimed35 man, gave me laughs! We should collab sometime!
2010-10-13‎@imatu777 Im not a fan of Bieber, just felt like following him.
2010-10-13‎@makemebad35 Proactive!
2010-10-13‎RT @twelthofadime: This young fellow interviewed me for his channel. Check out his stuff and marvel at my continual ability to seem... h ...
2010-10-13‎@makemebad35 It seems the day after I eat Burger King I get pimples, and its usually right when I am about to film. They suck ass!
2010-10-13‎@makemebad35 Also sent you questions last night, if you can do them later? Not sure if you saw my tweet or if you were busy
2010-10-12‎Heres a pic of me in the endzone while on the tour today. http://twitpic.com/2wvama
2010-10-12‎And this was our view for the game yesterday. It was high as hell but great view http://twitpic.com/2wvb7z
2010-10-12‎@synthplaya I'll take a look at it when I get the chance here. Still on my way home. Sorry for the late reply. Rushin' all day!
2010-10-12‎I will post the rest of the photos to my Facebook tomorrow. There are so many from the stadium. Didnt get near enough footage for a video =(
2010-10-12‎@Freakshow180 Oh trust me, we hit the storm. Lightning everywhere! Shook the plane quite a bit!
2010-10-12‎@Arkhalow I hate having writers blocks. Hope to film one Thursday if Im fortunate.
2010-10-12‎I am finally back home, what a trip! Bruno was off the wall to see us lol Cant wait to sleep in my own bed again.
2010-10-12‎@synthplaya New banner is great! Cant put it up yet because of stupid maintenance! Well done, though!  =)
2010-10-12‎@Freakshow180 Every year Chicago gives us problems and it continued this year. Surprised weather wasnt a factor.
2010-10-12‎@Freakshow180 Noticed flights to Detroit and NJ were canceled when we landed. Got lucky I suppose.
2010-10-12‎@Freakshow180 Sounds like WWI in my backyard
2010-10-12‎@Arkhalow He's scared right now because it's really thundering and lightning outside. But I will lol
2010-10-12‎@imatu777 I will tomorrow lol
2010-10-12‎@synthplaya The banner is great except the links dont work for some reason  =X  you cant click them...
2010-10-12‎@synthplaya Also you spelled subscribe wrong :X
2010-10-12‎@synthplaya Code? No...
2010-10-12‎@synthplaya Yes that was the problem. Thanks man! Looks great  =)
2010-10-12‎@synthplaya I found it, dont worry. Thanks again!
2010-10-12‎@synthplaya haha very true. Actually forgot you offered, must have been ages ago!
2010-10-12‎@synthplaya I would make them myself but without photoshop it is hard to get a good solid banner made. Paint.net doesnt really do the job.
2010-10-12‎Finally back in PA. Hit massive turbulance before landing. Cant wait to sleep in my own bed again!
2010-10-12‎Sucks going from 80s to 50s though  =(  Waiting for jet lag to catch up to me now. Had a blast on the trip like always  =)
2010-10-11‎@makemebad35 Glad youre happy, I watched my Cowboys lose in person  =(  third time Ive seen them lose in person. Eighth time Ive gone though
2010-10-11‎Well Im disappointed. (1-3) isnt what I was hoping for....
2010-10-11‎@makemebad35 I go once a year but sucks b/c next year I start college and cant afford to miss classes like that  =(  but good times going!
2010-10-11‎So our flight to Chicago is delayed because of a broken gage in the cockpit. They could fix it in 20 mins but decided to transfer us to
2010-10-11‎Another plane which actually took longer b/c it is now almost an hour wait. It is a full plane.
2010-10-11‎And now the new plane is too hot so they are cooling it off which takes longer. WTF American Airlines?!
2010-10-11‎Once we get to Chicago 'O Hare, we get on one more flight home. At least this kills the layover but jeez, never had this happen before...
2010-10-11‎Finally boarding an hour after we should have taken off. Every year Chicago gives us problems.
2010-10-10‎Just tried deepfried beer at the Texas State Fair lol so many random deep fried shit here
2010-10-10‎@nnaatteeks They put it in the middle of these ravioli-like things. Its like a tiny piece of bread. Wasnt bad but waaay better cold
2010-10-10‎@makemebad35 Saw your Torturer hammer at the Texas State Fair lol
2010-10-10‎Happy 10 10 10  =)
2010-10-10‎An hour until gametime! Go Cowboys!
2010-10-09‎Cowboys Stadium  =) http://twitpic.com/2vu4o8
2010-10-09‎Just met Billy Joe Dupree (Cowboys Tight End in the 70s)! At a new sports bar that opened today!
2010-10-09‎"Has anyone ever used ""Cha Cha"" before? Not gonna lie, I was sending random questions for a good hour or so lol"
2010-10-09‎@Nighty74 It a number you text to and you ask any question and they answer it. The number is 242242
2010-10-08‎@Nighty74 Yes it is real!

2010-10-03‎@nnaatteeks lol true true
2010-10-03‎Dont worry, the number has been blocked by both of us. Glad Verizon let's you block for free.
2010-10-03‎@imatu777 Dude, I dont even have him added as a friend lol
2010-10-03‎@Freakshow180 It is actually better than being roasting hot. I feel stressed when I overheat at night.
2010-10-03‎RT @Freakshow180: Theres way to many creepy people on the internet. And they attach to @PioneersProd like a virus.
2010-10-03‎I've had my fair share RT @freakshow180 Theres way too many creepy people on the internet and they attach to @PioneersProd like a virus
2010-10-03‎@imatu777 I used to rip stuff until I learned the joy of copyright infringements

2010-10-01‎@shanedawson I dont know how you are finding the time to film for three channels. Keep it up man!
2010-10-01‎@imatu777 Np haha
2010-10-01‎@shanedawson I wanted to go there yesterday!
2010-10-01‎So I heard today that a kid in my school got into a bad car accident. He was hit by a tractor trailer because he (student) ran a red light.
2010-10-01‎He was driving illegally though. Even though he is someone I cant stand, thats very tragic to hear. No word on his condition.
2010-10-01‎@Arkhalow Happy birthday.....again!

2010-09-30‎@imatu777 haha no problem! I just got it done in time just before I had to leave for college lol I didnt even get to see the footage :X

2010-09-30‎@LucasCruikshank Congrats on the 2 million man, thats an unbelievable feat!
2010-09-30‎@MysteryGuitarM Well at least you didnt lose any subs....technically lol
2010-09-30‎Left my headlights for an hour at the college. I was in a rush because I was running late. Hate when I leave them on!

2010-09-29‎Show was great, thanks for those who came  =)
2010-09-29‎@imatu777 Sending now, should get the footage in around two hours. I'd sleep on it.
2010-09-29‎@makemebad35 The torturer wants his glasses back!
2010-09-28‎Is it weird that I have dreams with other YouTubers? Like @shanedawson @makemebad35 @LucasCruikshank @smosh  lol  very frequently too
2010-09-28‎Like for no apparent reason I had a dream @shanedawson was wearing my shirt when I was interviewing him for a vid. Weird, I know...
2010-09-28‎@MysteryGuitarM Reporter fail but still awesome that you got on CNN!
2010-09-28‎@makemebad35 Thanks for the question submission lol made me laugh quite a bit

2010-09-28‎Going Live around 8pm Et - http://www.blogtv.com/people/PioneersProductionsBlog
2010-09-27‎@imatu777 True......
2010-09-27‎@imatu777 I meant through yt messages lol
2010-09-27‎@Arkhalow Dont really have a favorite, like reality shows a lot though
2010-09-27‎@Arkhalow What was your inspiration to make YouTube videos?
2010-09-27‎@imatu777 Not really ready to have a website yet. Too much going on here and dont have time to use it.
2010-09-27‎@imatu777 In the future, yes I will use it but not for a good while.
2010-09-27‎@imatu777 Oh boy lol thanks for making a fan-site!
2010-09-27‎@shanedawson Wait? Whats going on? Can you not log in or something?
2010-09-27‎@makemebad35 That's really gay. They need a verified account feature like Twitter has.
2010-09-27‎@imatu777 Lmao! Thanks for taking so many pictures  =)
2010-09-27‎RT @imatu777: http://pioneersprod.webs.com/apps/photos/album?albumid=10042345 Woah! Look at all those pics! And a caption for each one!  ...
2010-09-27‎@imatu777 Holy shit! Just realized I never sent you the collab footage. It isnt on my camera. Send me the script again. Filming it tomorrow
2010-09-27‎Filming a new Ask Randy tomorrow. Got some good questions lol Still not too late to submit!
2010-09-27‎I will be screencapturing your question and putting it on the video when answering, so your username and question are in the vid   =)
2010-09-27‎"@livinginthenorm Do you mean ""as a hobby""?"
2010-09-26‎"@twelthofadime lmao I would kill to see that picture! You should've stood up and yelled ""What the fuck are you doing?!"" like the Bieber vid"
2010-09-26‎@makemebad35 Janikowski blew it =X  My Cowboys finally won
2010-09-26‎5 Hour Energy can kiss my ass, it doesnt work!  =(  Im shaky, jittery, and still not wide awake.
2010-09-25‎@noobtubeprod You're a week late yesterday but thanks!
2010-09-25‎@Arkhalow I know right?
2010-09-25‎Pizza lunchables still kick ass! Wheres the pizza? That baby's gone @makemebad35 http://twitpic.com/2rz2d7
2010-09-24‎"Lol well turns out lots of people from my high school have seen my ""Whale""video. Lots ask if I knew the drivethru ppl. I did NOT lol"
2010-09-24‎Thank you Wendy's for the free string of hair in my fries.....might have been mine, though.
2010-09-24‎A look from back in the dairy cooler. Time to watch people lol http://twitpic.com/2rlp7z
2010-09-23‎@imatu777 lol I always plan to upload bloopers/outtakes to my second channel but there are always so many that I dont feel like doing it lol
2010-09-23‎@makemebad35 Hot damn! You're gonna be paying for that for classes today, if you have them
2010-09-23‎@Arkhalow Just did. You werent even on my friends list  :X
2010-09-23‎Another youtube glitch  =(  The modules only display 4 users if it is longways on you channel.
2010-09-23‎I was actually thinking about selling my old camera from 2009 but realized I gave @Freakshow180 the charger....and the battery is dead FUCK!
2010-09-23‎It is a Samsung widescreen camera. Nice for beginners to use. I might put it on ebay and upload a video about it.
2010-09-23‎But what's the use if I dont have the charger? @Freakshow180 lost his, so I gave him mine lol
2010-09-23‎@nnaatteeks I will have to see. I mean I could charge it and send the camera but there's no point without the charger.
2010-09-23‎For those wondering, it looks very similar to this but is blue on the viewfinder - http://bit.ly/bsGtVv
2010-09-23‎@imatu777 I'd would say roughly over $100 without the charger and with probably $120. It still is relatively in good condition.
2010-09-23‎@imatu777 If you were to buy it brand new it would be over $200 from best buy
2010-09-23‎@imatu777 I cant though without the charger. Freakshow wont have one for his camera (he has the same one that I am selling).
2010-09-23‎@imatu777 There would be no point sending a battery-dead camcorder to someone lol
2010-09-23‎@imatu777 I guess what I could do is just charge it and send it fully charged. The person who buys it can search for a charger for it.
2010-09-23‎@imatu777 But they would also need a memory card. They always screw you somehow lol You can record 30 seconds without a memory card
2010-09-23‎"@imatu777 I have yet to find out lol I imagine I deleted it from last year XD The last video filmed with that was ""Rainy Days"""
2010-09-22‎Summer is officially over  =( http://twitpic.com/2qq3r9

2010-09-16‎@4hand561 Omg, you haz a twitter!
2010-09-16‎As a good bit of you know tomorrow is my 18th birthday. Crazy! I can legally be kicked out of my own house lol
2010-09-16‎Went out to eat tonight but luckily the waitresses didnt sing. Thats the first time I think I wasnt sung to.
2010-09-16‎Also little known fact. Im a Dallas Cowboys fan. They got their first ever victory on September 17th, 1961, MY BIRTHDAY. Ironic? lol
2010-09-15‎@makemebad35 Check your DMs
2010-09-15‎@LucasCruikshank Wht do you plan to do when you grow too old for Fred? Post other stuff to the Fred channel?
2010-09-15‎These alleries are a killer. Started right when I woke up today and knocked me out for nearly 3 hours. At least I got thr voices done.
2010-09-15‎For the next video. I got very lucky exporting them. The system DIDNT crash because I did it quickly. Should be smooth sailing now!
2010-09-15‎Only problem is I cant save my work in movie maker or it crashes. This is all or nothing. Makes me nervous if my computer restarts somehow.
2010-09-15‎@mightylions1 He has never replied to my @replys ever but did comment my channel (Fred) two years ago. Probably was a bot though. No idea.
2010-09-14‎@makemebad35 lmao whats next? Ice cream soup? lol
2010-09-14‎Im actually looking at the comments on Fred's latest video and am dead shocked on how many people have lost respect for him.
2010-09-14‎And I agree that his old videos are waaaay better than these, but I still dont particularly like Fred, even his old videos.
2010-09-14‎He is making these videos that are twice as annoying as the past ones and is getting paid for them and music albums, plus the movie.
2010-09-14‎It is just getting out of hand with Fred. I bet not even a 1/4 of his subscribers like his videos. IDK but thats my opinion on Fred.
2010-09-14‎@nnaatteeks I used to like his vids a lot but then his season three really dropped the ball. It's the same thing every time
2010-09-14‎@nnaatteeks And plus his scenes and camera shots transition so fast, you cant digest what the hell just happened.
2010-09-14‎@imatu777 What?
2010-09-14‎But he can only do the character for so long.It's just gotten out of hand, especially with a near 18 year old acting 6. Hope the movie is it
2010-09-14‎"@nnaatteeks And all he has been doing is promoting. All over his channel ""FRED SHIRTS, FRED PENS, FRED MUSIC!"" It's everywhere."
2010-09-14‎@PointBaron Thats a tad different lol
2010-09-14‎@synthplaya Well thats what gets me thinking. What is he going to do when he needs to quit Fred? Post other stuff on the channel?
2010-09-14‎@synthplaya No way in hell he would delete the channel. Almost 2 million subs. What will happen is the question.
2010-09-14‎@nnaatteeks I dont hate Lucas, I just hate Fred. Anything he does after Fred wont be nearly as bad. Act your own age for once!
2010-09-14‎@synthplaya I can only imagine Fred as a teenager....oh wait thats every day isnt it?  Lol
2010-09-14‎@imatu777 Theres no way Lucas would do that. It's his creation and he's making thousands upon thousands of dollars off of it.
2010-09-14‎@imatu777 It he turned it over to his brother or someone, the unsubs would flood his channel
2010-09-14‎Wow, that is pretty much the first time I've tweeted about Fred. First time for everything I guess.
2010-09-14‎@imatu777 I just cant wait to see the outcome of all of this. Either way, his channel will die out eventually.
2010-09-14‎@imatu777 Well he didnt expect it to get big like this. He has the most hate on YouTube I believe.
2010-09-14‎@nnaatteeks haha if only that were possible
2010-09-14‎Look what I found! A comment I posted with my first channel ever, two years ago! The channel got suspended and the http://twitpic.com/2o94of
2010-09-14‎@noobtubeprod I upload copyright infringing material like King of the Hill and Simpsons, making videos out of them. Had over 100 vids too =(
2010-09-14‎@noobtubeprod Not really, it's their rights, they have the right to take it down.
2010-09-13‎As a Cowboys fan all I can say is FUUUUUUUUUCKING CHRIIIIST
2010-09-13‎@IRproductions But def. worth the money!
2010-09-13‎@IRproductions And no, it is if I go to open a file or even just upload a video to youtube, it crashes. No matter what software I go into.
2010-09-13‎@IRproductions I believe it is a 2006
2010-09-13‎So great I gotta send the voices for the next video, unedited, to my downstairs computer. Pitch them & send them back to my computer, FUCK!

2010-09-12‎@IRproductions Link doesnt work because it's for mobile phones
2010-09-12‎Hoping to get this new video up Monday. Im am way too tired to edit this tonight. It looks like it will turn out fine when it's edited.
2010-09-12‎@CyberAceTV At this early in the morning??
2010-09-12‎Okay WTF?! Im having the fucking problem where my computer X's right out of FireFox if I go to upload or like in WMM where I go to open
2010-09-12‎It's the computer itself. It's not the softwares. IDK what to do. I was a few mins into editing my video and now have to start ALL OVER!!!!
2010-09-12‎This sucks ass. IDK what to do.
2010-09-12‎I might be forced to edit on my other computer. I cant believe this is happening again. IDK what I did last time.
2010-09-12‎@synthplaya I want one for my bday but doubt Im getting it
2010-09-12‎@synthplaya Theres no way my parents would let me withdraw 1200.00

2010-09-10‎Can it be true? Yes! I finally finished filming the new video, for sure!  =)
2010-09-10‎After three times of redoing it, I think it is finally ready to be edited!
2010-09-09‎@makemebad35 It's going on and off with the video being there and then refreshing it it disappears.Very strange. Also it says u have 0 views
2010-09-09‎Think I might actually do a rant for my next second channel video. Never did one before, why not do one?  =)
2010-09-09‎@synthplaya w00t! w00t!
2010-09-09‎@livinginthenorm I have an idea in mind. Cant really sum it up in a few sentences here. Just have to wait and see.
2010-09-09‎@Creepshow360 Wow I should really check who follows me more often lol dunno how long you've had that twitter XD
2010-09-09‎@livinginthenorm No it is. It's going to be a serious rant.
2010-09-09‎Is it weird that I wear AXE hair gel before bed just because it smells good when I lay down on my pillow? lol hair glue day, AXE night

2010-09-07‎Sadly I have to postpone the Live show. Computer is fucking up so bad. Sorry everyone.
2010-09-07‎Rescheduling it to tomorrow night at 8pm ET. Every few seconds my browser froze. Sucked so bad  =(
2010-09-07‎@IRproductions The irony that the one time I make a video saying Im Live, the browser crashes. What a disappointment for me  =(
2010-09-07‎@Nighty74 Im glad some found it funny
2010-09-07‎@iFahmi13 Browser crashed =( Every few seconds my computer would freeze. Then without warning I lost connection to blogtv alltogether
2010-09-07‎@makemebad35 Live tonight, you free?  8pm ET
2010-09-06‎Okay, how on Earth did my tv turn on by itself at 5am, with the volume blasting?! Thats Paid Programming for ya.
2010-09-06‎Somehow the remote was in my hand, FOR TURNING THE TV ON ONLY. The DirecTv also turned itself on somehow. WTF???
2010-09-06‎This video is really pissing me off. Nothings working out.
2010-09-06‎@imatu777 Im going to do a different video and then go back to this one. It's taking so much time for this two minutes video it's crazy.
2010-09-05‎Fear Factor is on, wow! Havent seen that show in almost 4 years.
2010-09-05‎@jaelentruong I love McDonald's but always get the regret portion of the meal soon afterwords. But it's usually worth it.
2010-09-05‎@imatu777 You fucking suck lol AND I just did it twice, fuck me!
2010-09-05‎About time the Cardinals cut Matt Leinart. He sucked from day one.
2010-09-05‎@makemebad35 lol get it on flip!
2010-09-05‎@Arkhalow I usually search endlessly on Google. Abstract backgrounds are pretty good.
2010-09-05‎@makemebad35 You free Monday night?
2010-09-04‎@Makemebad35 Slappy always gave me nightmares. The living dummy.
2010-09-04‎@imatu777 The third one was the one that scared the shit out of me years ago.
2010-09-04‎Okay so I filmed two scenes today for the video. Both were in public lol still need to do the rest. Not sure when I can do it this weekend.
2010-09-03‎@imatu777 @freakshow180 Didnt the robots voice used to be different? Like in the intro.
2010-09-03‎@imatu777 You know how much it would suck to re-record the entire season lol
2010-09-03‎@freakshow180 I used to watch the show all the time. I know the voice was like that but they switched it to the kid voice. At least I think.
2010-09-03‎Did some voice tests for this next video, lol'd quite a bit! Filming again on Friday. Need to reshoot everything. New character in this one!
2010-09-03‎@shanedawson Never knew you still did Live shows. UStream wouldnt let me in the chat room last week =(
2010-09-03‎@shanedawson Cabbage :X
2010-09-03‎@twelthofadime Never knew you had a Flip cam.
2010-09-03‎@GanimedFTW Hopefully it turns out like planned. Dont want to trash my voice early though like last time.
2010-09-03‎@shanedawson Glad you got it filmed!
2010-09-03‎Filming the new video. This is going to take a while....

2010-08-30‎Filming a new video on Friday. Wanted to do it today but didnt have the time. It is going to be waaay better than Home Invasion lol
2010-08-30‎Not sure how many users like the serious videos as compared to the normal vids. Only doing serious videos every few months.
2010-08-30‎@livinginthenorm I like doing serious videos now and then. It's something different. Sometimes different is good once in a while.
2010-08-30‎@makemebad35 Going to attempt your strategy for one of my vids, garbage bags on windows lol we shall see lol
2010-08-29‎No show tonight sorry guys, got a pounding headache and dead tired from work.
2010-08-29‎Okay so I went to McDonald's and of course there are stoners in front of me. There's a big dude standing RIGHT BY WHERE YOU ORDER
2010-08-29‎"He starts walking up to my car and says something almost by my window and I give a look like ""what?"". He says it again."
2010-08-29‎I still didnt understand. He jumps in the car in front of me and then starts yelling at the greeter which was laughing.
2010-08-29‎IDK but thats close enough to being threatened by druggies for my liking. It's Saturday night, they're hopped up!
2010-08-29‎@PointBaron Please do!
2010-08-29‎@shanedawson Couldnt get to your Live show yesterday. The chat wouldnt load. Twitter chat did though, WTF?
2010-08-29‎@imatu777 So sorry I havent gotten the collab footage sent to you. I've been so busy this past week it's crazy. Importing tonight, promise.

2010-08-28‎@imatu777 Vlogs, if you want to call them that, are way easier and quicker to film and upload. Normal videos take days.
2010-08-28‎@PointBaron lol I cannot stop laughing at that video man!
2010-08-28‎@PointBaron The things you can do with cereal lmao
2010-08-28‎@smoshanthony Thanks you made me addicted to burritos with your Lunchtime With Smosh series lol
2010-08-28‎Did I seriously fall asleep with my glasses on and my tv remotes on my bed, with the tv still on???
2010-08-28‎Possibly a Live show tonight around 10pm ET.

2010-08-26‎w00t @YouTube is doing maintenance! Never thought I'd be happy to say that  =)
2010-08-26‎@synthplaya Hope they're fixing the subscribers glitch. I didnt lose any though =)
2010-08-26‎@livinginthenorm Lagging like slow connection? Works fine for me, maybe it's the maintenance.
2010-08-25‎@makemebad35 good luck with the publishing. Mine was at 0% for two hours but at least it published.
2010-08-25‎So I was in the bakery today cleaning the floor with my co-worker and this mouse just appears out of nowhere. Spent 10 minutes trying to get
2010-08-25‎Trying to get it lol And we moved the soda coolers by the registers, there was an envelope of three month old Swiss cheese under it :X
2010-08-25‎Starting carrying it around daring co-workers to smell it lol smelled like shit you pull out of your big toe XO
2010-08-25‎Yes....I literally smelled it lol It smells just as you'd expect three month old Swiss cheese to smell.
2010-08-25‎@imatu777 It was way beyond rancid lol made your nose hairs cross and tie!
2010-08-25‎Wow, why are all of the top users losing hundreds of subscribers by the second??
2010-08-25‎@makemebad35 Apparently it's a glitch
2010-08-25‎@LucasCruikshank It's happening to all of the top users. Look at Shane Dawson's channel. Glitch.
2010-08-25‎@thewillofdc Thats a crazy glitch
2010-08-24‎Check out this collab I was in with @jaelentruong - http://bit.ly/bbVrcJ  Im the first clip
2010-08-24‎@imatu777 It was by far the weirdest collab request I've filmed
2010-08-24‎"New video, ""Home Invasion!!!"" - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-a6Uiu2Z1k @makemebad35"
2010-08-24‎@imatu777 Thanks!
2010-08-24‎@IRproductions Thanks much!
2010-08-24‎@synthplaya Alcohol is fine now and then, but not so much that you turn into an alcoholic. Other drugs, I'd never do.
2010-08-24‎@SmoshIan lmao!
2010-08-24‎@freakshow180 lol didnt recognize any of those channels except for a select few.

2010-08-23‎Feels like Im cheating the school system lol turns out I have a different lunch so I get to leave at 1pm instead of 12:20, every day.
2010-08-23‎@IRproductions It's hard to find days in advance now, because sometimes I dont feel like doing it because Im tired from work

2010-08-22‎@imatu777 Nooo!
2010-08-22‎Only thing I will say is it is a serious video. Havent made one in a while. Watched it and it seems okay. Hope you all like it  =)
2010-08-22‎@Arkhalow I dont do collab channels, too much going on =P
2010-08-22‎Well this is it, my last day of summer break =(
2010-08-22‎@IRproductions Summer homework?! WTF??
2010-08-22‎Going to edit the new video tomorrow, since I get out of school at 12:15 every day of the year  =)
2010-08-22‎Next week I start the college class (August 31st). That will be interesting.
2010-08-22‎@makemebad35 Hope your new roommates are as crazy as Kyle lol Nick is still your roommate, yes?
2010-08-22‎Also, thank God we moved our microwave again, so I wont blow breakers anymore with my computer  =)
2010-08-21‎@ChrisAGEAN730 Noooo!
2010-08-21‎@makemebad35 Also Im still having the Flip cam problem where I have to remove the battery after my footage is imported. WTF? Makes no sense!
2010-08-21‎@ChrisAGEAN730 I hate every change they're making but I cant picture myself uploading to a different site, never happen!
2010-08-21‎@IRproductions I made theoriginalfred35 account so no one else would take it. I closed it but forget the email to reopen it =(
2010-08-21‎@IRproductions But still, what would you use it for? lol
2010-08-21‎@Nighty74 Im beginning to believe it!
2010-08-21‎Check out this collab I did with @synthplaya, enjoy - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Gz0rq78vtc&feature=sub
2010-08-21‎@SmoshIan I hope someone uploads it  =)
2010-08-21‎@Nighty74 I saw that! lol
2010-08-21‎@makemebad35 When do you go back to college? And glad you watched the collab  =)
2010-08-21‎@jaelentruong Hope to have my footage sent to you tonight. Shouldnt take long to send.
2010-08-21‎@makemebad35 Did you see http://www.youtube.com/giraffealigator  is reposting your vids again (pju129d)?  =(
2010-08-21‎@Arkhalow I know right?
2010-08-21‎@jaelentruong haha it was somewhat uncomfortable doing lol
2010-08-21‎@smoshian Your burritos made me hungry for one!
2010-08-21‎@shanedawson See you're pushing yourself too hard with these videos  =)
2010-08-21‎"""Hello to You!"" - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yyCnrFf__4   saying hello to new subscribers"
2010-08-21‎@makemebad35 I didnt have smosh or realannoyingorange's video in my box, or Shanes, WTF?
2010-08-21‎@IRproductions I fucking hate bees!
2010-08-20‎@synthplaya Check your email, should have the first clip
2010-08-20‎WTF? Anyone else's twitter page glitching saying they're following 0 and have 0 followers?
2010-08-20‎@Sammybecool Weird because if you go to a page it says you're not following them. I got worried for a minute lol
2010-08-20‎@synthplaya Second clip is on it's way, should have it in an hour. The third will be in your inbox in probably three hours.
2010-08-20‎@synthplaya Should have two clips by now. Sending the final clip now.
2010-08-20‎A plane crashed into a river next to my store, holy shit!
2010-08-20‎Drove by the crash site, it was a twin engine plane, not a big plane. People actually on the bridge watching the scene.Word is no fatalities
2010-08-20‎Thats crazy, dont ever see that. It was literally 1500ft from the store! Wish I had my Flip with me.
2010-08-19‎@householdhacker That Bieber sound clip sounds like ancient music they'd play in history videos lol
2010-08-19‎@Arkhalow What grade?
2010-08-19‎@makemebad35 Yeah IDK, but that new ribbon is so annyoing. It takes you to recently viewed. Im used to clicking my channel name and viewing.
2010-08-19‎"@makemebad35 I also keep clicking ""insight"" instead of ""messages"" because Im used to it saying inbox.  XP"
2010-08-19‎@makemebad35 But now looks like they already removed the one click link for your channel name, where it used to be the drop down.

2010-08-14‎@freakshow180 Yeah that'll be the day!
2010-08-14‎So finally I think I have the ad sharing issue settled. Finally Partner Support was more broad saying tell us the artist, the download link
2010-08-14‎and so on, so I did that for both videos. Hopefully ads will appear overnight.
2010-08-14‎@SmoshIan You lost Food Battle 2010 because @smoshanthony lied lol

2010-08-13‎@makemebad35 Also see that account is still reposting your videos? Id report it, especially since it's your full name.
2010-08-13‎"@synthplaya Yeah, Damian DMd me asking if it was mine lol I told him who it was and he's like ""Yeah, dont know why but I thought it was him"""
2010-08-13‎@synthplaya Damn straight
2010-08-13‎Why are horror movies being released at weird times of the year? Rob Zombie's Halloweens in August, Friday The 13th in February
2010-08-13‎And now the Child's Play remake in July of 2011. WTF? Also the Nightmare on Elm Street was early this year. Release them around Halloween!
2010-08-13‎@freakshow180 Yeah, cant wait to see it, but hope it isnt a bust like all of the other classic remakes. They want to reboot the franchise.
2010-08-13‎@freakshow180 Favorite horror movie series in order: Halloween, Friday The 13th, Child's Play
2010-08-13‎@smosh Cant wait for Food Battle 2010 today!

2010-08-13‎Holy shit, four houses down there are 5 police cars! There have been around 4 robberies in my neighborhood recently.They finally got the guy
2010-08-13‎He also robbed my grandparents last year! Best part is I got it on tape =)
2010-08-13‎Turns out after all of that they didnt get the guy, FUCK!
2010-08-13‎@Arkhalow Yeah, kinda lengthy but I will
2010-08-13‎For those asking, yes I will upload the footage. The police are gone now. The video will be lengthy.
2010-08-13‎@IRproductions I dont think they're as good anymore. They shouldnt be #5 even. Two years ago they were so much funnier.
2010-08-13‎@imatu777 Yeah it's crazy! I got a mad adrenaline rush when I passed the scene but sadly the guy got a away. He robbed around 6 houses here.
2010-08-13‎@freakshow180 Yeah
2010-08-13‎@qxvz Highly doubt that lol
2010-08-13‎@imatu777 Yeah I saw your tweet, thanks a lot =P

2010-08-12‎@makemebad35 Damn man! Hope it turns out the way you hoped
2010-08-12‎@qxvz Ignore you??? You didnt even recommend anything =P
2010-08-12‎@makemebad35 IDK if you meant reply to partnersupport but I even replied to the rejection message and still nothing. They recommended links
2010-08-12‎@qxvz I never got any tweets like that. I got one saying calm down lol thats it
2010-08-12‎I dont want to work at 8am tomorrow! But they're paying me, guess I will have to go.
2010-08-12‎@qxvz Okay messaged you on the yt on your twitter
2010-08-12‎@freakshow180 Everyone gets in top comedians lol
2010-08-12‎@makemebad35 I will ask on the YouTube help forums, they usually have the answer fairly quickly.
2010-08-12‎Still no reply from YouTube Ad Sharing on the MAIN video. No rejection notice but no ads either....hmm.
2010-08-12‎I know that rejection notice is coming lol we shall see...

2010-08-11‎@freakshow180 WTF? How does someone edit that? lol
2010-08-11‎@CyberAceTV Which is why I also have a part-time job =)
2010-08-11‎Why have my past three dreams dealt with me smoking?! I dont smoke! One even had Dale Gribble in it lol
2010-08-11‎@CyberAceTV It is, still no ads. Got the email for that and bloopers video a few days ago. Taking a while.
2010-08-11‎WTF? YouTube isnt allowing ad sharing on the bloopers video because of the music. They're saying I gotta fax them and shit saying I
2010-08-11‎Saying I own the rights to the music or the company saying Im allowed to use it.
2010-08-11‎@CyberAceTV It's http://www.incompetech.com/  it's Royalty Free Music and I included it in the application.
2010-08-11‎The video might get pulled from the site if I dont submit that form saying I own the right's in 7 days or I have to disable ad sharing.
2010-08-11‎@CyberAceTV I said it was Royalty Free Music and that the site allows you to use it, and included it in the description bar. Still rejected.
2010-08-11‎Which sucks because I did the same for the MAIN VIDEO  :X  IDK, gotta see how it plays out.
2010-08-11‎@CyberAceTV I just did, Im hoping they respond at partner support
2010-08-11‎@makemebad35 Hey got a slight problem here with the ad sharing. Partner support is going to remove the bloopers video because of royalty
2010-08-11‎@makemebad35 royalty free music, but that is legal for youtube videos. I got seven days or they will pull the video.
2010-08-11‎@makemebad35 I included the incompetech.com url in the ad sharing application but they are saying it's copyrighted. What do you do?
2010-08-11‎@makemebad35 Because you've used royalty music before. Do you include it in your application?
2010-08-11‎@makemebad35 The application they send for ad sharing. There's a music bullet.
2010-08-11‎@CyberAceTV Thats what I did, still rejected
2010-08-11‎"@CyberAceTV They said like ""To Better Assist You We Have These Resource Links"" etc.  help forums and such"
2010-08-11‎"@ChrisAgean730 No, the video got ""partnered"" (ad sharing)"
2010-08-11‎@ChrisAgean730 When a video becomes popular fast they offer ad sharing on the video.

2010-08-08‎So what gives? My bloopers video got offered ad sharing (partnership) and my main video didnt. WTF???? But I did upload the bloopers first.
2010-08-08‎Maybe thats why? Because 20,000 views compared to 6,000 views, WTF??
2010-08-08‎@Nighty74 I dont get it though lol the main video got views faster

2010-08-08‎Theres still the first uploaded video message from last year in my inbox haha Had 882 unread yahoo messages lol I dont check it XD
2010-08-08‎@imatu777 Im trying to be conservative with music nowadays. Im only using music from websites that allow it.
2010-08-07‎Why do I always work when @makemebad35 is going to post a new video?!
2010-08-07‎Okay its time I say it,the fucking sponsor ads on BlogTv are annoying as hell! Every time I go to a blogtv page the ad pops up! @makemebad35

2010-08-07‎@imatu777 Okay got it, I will watch it in a few mins.
2010-08-07‎@imatu777 It's good but too long for an intro. I dont think I will ever need an intro for my channels. It would need to be less than 10 secs
2010-08-07‎@IRproductions Happy birthday! And great askPioneers intro! Def. gonna use it  =)
2010-08-07‎@imatu777 I am only going to use one and thats for askPioneers. @IRproductions made one.

2010-08-06‎"Dont forget to submit questions to ""askPioneers""! Submissions are always open  =)  - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vlSBzceJnMU"
2010-08-06‎@freakshow180 Isnt there a 300 character limit or something lol
2010-08-06‎@IRproductions Go right ahead!
2010-08-06‎@freakshow180 I remember when I joined in 2008, I said I was 40 or something, so I dont need to worry about it :X
2010-08-06‎RT @jackassworld: RT @myspacemovies: High five Wee-Man in the exclusive trailer premiere for Johnny Knoxville and crew's Jackass 3D! htt ...
2010-08-06‎@freakshow180 He said he's quitting until he's 17, look at facebook.
2010-08-06‎@ganimed35 We're trying to get a date down. Maybe before summer ends. We have ideas but will probably have less people this time. Easier.
2010-08-06‎@IRproductions PioneersProductions@yahoo.com  send it there, I dont use that email.
2010-08-06‎@freakshow180 It's on my wall
2010-08-06‎@IRproductions You can make it now if you'd like. I will make the video in a little over a week from now. Need more questions.
2010-08-06‎@freakshow180 makemebad35 thing?
2010-08-06‎@synthplaya I switched my layout back. I felt like it was promoting too much on the sides. But at least I had it up for a few weeks  =)
2010-08-06‎@makemebad35 The insight on the video says 3000 people saw it from your damian video, glad it helped  =)  also bloopers has over 4000 views!
2010-08-05‎@CrazyTechDude Tall order lol
2010-08-05‎Going to start scripting my videos from now on. Way better than just improvising in my mind, as I make the video.
2010-08-05‎@imatu777 Ahhh!
2010-08-05‎@imatu777 How the hell does that relate to scripting videos???
2010-08-05‎@freakshow180 Thats what I've been doing the past two years
2010-08-05‎@PointBaron Scripts are usually for the better. You know what you are going to do instead of hoping to think of something along the way.
2010-08-05‎@PointBaron But writing the script can be a challenge as well
2010-08-05‎Up this early to go river rafting. Havent gone in years.
2010-08-05‎Also, the Alligator/Horse Head video is only 2000 views from being my most viewed video!
2010-08-05‎@freakshow180 lol had you first over the lower ranked users because you're my friend  =) but sure I will fix it lol
2010-08-05‎@CrazyTechDude Never used a fisheye lens before. Ive seen them used but were never crazy for them.
2010-08-05‎@CyberAceTV Im praying on it. Ive applied so many times. But after every fail, I gained lots more subs in the two month spans.
2010-08-05‎@CyberAceTV I applied about four months ago, still NOTHING! No replies.
2010-08-05‎Also I had a drem last night where I was on a roller coaster that flew off the trackl and exploded in the loop of another coaster.I died lol
2010-08-05‎@Arkhalow Now has over 12,700  =O   and thanks!
2010-08-05‎@CrazyTechDude Yeah, so Ive seen.
2010-08-05‎@synthplaya I've never really done it before. You've been doing it over a year lol
2010-08-05‎So Mr. Horse Head Meets Mr. Wooden Alligator is now my most viewed video with over 12,800 views =)
2010-08-05‎Rafting was fun. Raft deflated though lol Had to walk 1/10th of at the end. Fell on my ass lol it hurt.....Glad I didnt bring the Flip
2010-08-05‎1/10th of a mile, I meant to say. Also scraped my back on a rock. My flip flops (sandals) kept unlatching and got away from me.Got them back
2010-08-05‎Got away multiple times haha but it was a fun day  =)
2010-08-05‎@SmoshIan There would be a Justin Bieber one lol
2010-08-05‎"I created a new channel called ""askPioneers"" - http://www.youtube.com/user/askPioneers  read the channel description  =)"

2010-08-04‎@twelthofadime lol It says I subscribed to one person. Mine is fixed though.
2010-08-04‎@IRproductions My breaker blew just now. I ended the show because the power went out in my room. It'll take forever to reboot.
2010-08-04‎@TonnySapiano When's the youtube collab going to be up? Just realized itt's been so long since I filmed it.
2010-08-04‎"@EmptyIsAwesome You mean ""collabing""?"
2010-08-04‎Had to end the Live show because my breaker blew. Thanks for coming though  =)
2010-08-04‎@makemebad35 You're video finally published  =)  and once again thanks so much for the promotion, you really are the greatest youtuber  =)
2010-08-04‎@TonnySapiano Trust me, I know how frustrating collabs can be lol
2010-08-04‎Mr. Horse Head Meets Mr. Wooden Alligator - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MuR08w3TFU0   in case you havent seen it yet  =)
2010-08-04‎@makemebad35 It would help if it wasnt lagged out at 308 since this morning lol not sure how many views it has yet. I'd give it a few hours.
2010-08-04‎@makemebad35 But what Im shocked about is the bloopers video went over 300 views as well, with over 55 likes.
2010-08-04‎@makemebad35 Never thought so many people would want to see you fuck up so much! lol
2010-08-04‎@shaycarl That thing is a piece of shit lol it always pops up even when you're mouse isnt near it
2010-08-04‎@freakshow180 Cant yet, hasnt been uploaded long enough.
2010-08-04‎@freakshow180 Like, was actually real? Or was it set up?
2010-08-04‎@freakshow180 It almost looks like it was scripted sometimes lol remixes are funny
2010-08-04‎@freakshow180 Were users posting videos of her? I mean if it was hateful comments then what the fuck!? They're text comments lol
2010-08-04‎@EmptyIsAwesome Oh yeah, like re-uploading whole videos of popular vids and shit. Pisses me off too.
2010-08-04‎@freakshow180 Well I imagine they never knew what they'd get themselves into lol hundreds of thousands of people know now lol
2010-08-04‎@freakshow180 Thats something that youtube cant stop, people uploading videos over and over like that lol
2010-08-04‎@imatu777 Someone commented saying that a rap would be possible for the bloopers lol I said I know a user who an make that happen XD
2010-08-04‎@imatu777 Cant wait though! At least Im not the one editing for a change =)
2010-08-04‎@smoshanthony Im not a touchscreen keyboard guy. Never liked it really.
2010-08-04‎People really amaze me. Wow is all I can say lol http://twitpic.com/2bfhps
2010-08-04‎@imatu777 Sucks because your going backwards from what it was
2010-08-04‎@imatu777 Youre  going in reverse. I received the filed in .mov format and made them WMV
2010-08-04‎RT @imatu777: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ksxv6acw9M Meh @freakshow180 @PioneersProd

2010-08-04‎@shanedawson I edited a makemebad35 collab this past week and it took hours of overnight editing. Felt like you lol took a week to edit XP
2010-08-04‎@freakshow180 I will never take you out of my box  =)
2010-08-04‎So I finally got an honor on the Alligator/Horse Head video, w00t!  #81Top Rated Today - (Entertainment)  =)
2010-08-04‎Starting to feel like the video could've been so much better on my part but every video comes with that feeling. Too late now lol
2010-08-04‎But hey, at least 80% or so liked it so thats all that matters.
2010-08-04‎Satisfied with the bloopers video though lol 1500+ views and almost no thumbs down.
2010-08-04‎For the first time ever I got a yt message telling me to stop making videos. I actually lol'd. Haters just for some reason make me laugh.
2010-08-04‎@freakshow180 You fucker lol I was like what the hell???
2010-08-04‎@imatu777 Is it youuu? lol removed the user anyway. Might switch it to manually accept members.

2010-08-03‎Mr. Horse Head Meets Mr. Wooden Alligator, it's finally here! - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MuR08w3TFU0 @makemebad35
2010-08-03‎@freakshow180 w00t!
2010-08-03‎@Arkhalow Thanks for RT'ing  =)
2010-08-03‎@Arkhalow Thanks much!
2010-08-03‎@LucasCruikshank Fred sounds older
2010-08-03‎@Arkhalow Im surprised I never did before. Plus my twitter stream is kind of dead at times (posts by twitter users) so I need to follow more
2010-08-03‎@astrosteve The Horse Head goes back to November. I had two videos of him. Just spoofing makemebad. Then I thought I'd combine them in one.
2010-08-03‎@astrosteve As you can probably tell Damian was born to do the voice for the gator.When I do it it just isnt the same.But I will get better.
2010-08-03‎@astrosteve Nope, Damian just does the Alligator lol
2010-08-03‎@makemebad35 lol I doubt that's copyright material
2010-08-03‎Happy with the feedback so far =)  A few cheesy comments here and there but every video comes with that.
2010-08-03‎@CrazyTechDude Awesome =)
2010-08-03‎@CrazyTechDude Im not one to keep in-tact with website making. I make one and then I dont touch it for a year and then repeat lol
2010-08-03‎Also happy with the decent popularity of the bloopers video. Over 300 views already  =)
2010-08-03‎@CrazyTechDude I applied months ago. Still NOTHING!
2010-08-03‎@imatu777 Another collab like this is lots of work. Im not sure I would do a second. Want to keep switching it up.
2010-08-03‎@imatu777 But yeah, I see your point. Hard to make it look as realistic as possible.
2010-08-03‎"@imatu777 I still have to promote it again. It's just starting up again. Wont be doing much for a little while.I only put up some ""About Me"""
2010-08-03‎@makemebad35 Bastards! YouTube is supposed to be entertainment for everyone. Now all of the copyrights are blowing out videos
2010-08-03‎@makemebad35 Almost quoted @TheRealRyanHiga lol
2010-08-03‎@synthplaya Happy Birthday is copyrighted. Damian wanted to put it in his new video.
2010-08-03‎@CrazyTechDude I would but I dont feel like waiting another two to three, or even four months again =P
2010-08-03‎@smoshanthony haha thats a fail.
2010-08-03‎@PointBaron Sorry but it looks like I stole your box spot on Damian's channel =I
2010-08-03‎@synthplaya Glad Damian put me in there without me asking  =)  same as with PointBaron
2010-08-03‎I am mentioned at the end of @makemebad35 's new second channel video. Check it out =)  Lots of tickets! - http://bit.ly/ciMHFV
2010-08-03‎@buckhollywood =), top that! lol
2010-08-02‎@nnaatteeks Collab with Damian? I would imagine lol probably next year if I would.
2010-08-02‎I am finally in the final stages of editing, w00t! Just going to add some background music and throw in the Alligator voice.
2010-08-02‎The video is offically 4 minutes 25 seconds long. Cant wait to upload it  =)
2010-08-02‎Tweet number 7,777, all 7s! Seven's my favorite number.
2010-08-02‎@freakshow180 Noooo!
2010-08-02‎@PointBaron Thats how I felt last night. Every time I used a tool in WMM or Paint.Net, it froze
2010-08-02‎@Arkhalow No I dont
2010-08-02‎@PointBaron haha well I hope to get a Mac for my bday or for Christmas
2010-08-02‎@imatu777 Never!
2010-08-02‎So today I was in frozen for an hour and got locked in the ice cream freezer. The knob was broken lol in the for 15 minutes no coat fuck me!
2010-08-02‎Its a round knob you hit and it didnt budge. That was horrible lol but the manager heard the banging.
2010-08-02‎Are you ready for Mr. Horse Head Meets Mr. Wooden Alligator? The package of fun arrives tomorrow morning! Probably around 11am ET.
2010-08-01‎Once again, I still didnt finish editing. Im close but once again, the technical portion ate up hours. So far it's looking great though =)
2010-08-01‎I would've been done last night if it didnt keep freezing the past two nights! Ugh! I cant stand WMM anymore. Getting Alligator voice today.
2010-08-01‎@IRproductions Yes you are  =)
2010-08-01‎It's by far the hardest collab I've done RT @nnaatteeks @PioneersProd Dam Randy ur never going to want to do a collab agian after this.
2010-08-01‎Going to spend the night editing, again! Should have it finished tonight. Still have to get the Alligator voices but I will have it tomorrow
2010-08-01‎@PointBaron Your tweets really amaze me sometimes lol
2010-08-01‎Also finally got all of the names for shoutouts when I upload the video. I used Random.org so the order is fair, not playing favorites.
2010-08-01‎Also, so it's fair, I included EVERYONE who commented on the suggestions video a month ago, so if you commented, luck you!
2010-08-01‎There are officially 30 people who will be given shoutous, WOW! I will post the video as a response to the collab with an annotation too.
2010-08-01‎Thank @imatu777 for saving screen captures of all of the comments. I asked him to do it a month ago and finally it has paid off. Thanks man!
2010-08-01‎@imatu777 I was shocked to see the pictures still there. I was scared because I must have accidentally deleted them in the past month.
2010-08-01‎@imatu777 So glad to see you still had them because then I wouldnt be able to do the shoutouts! lol
2010-07-31‎Fuck almost lost my fucking legs!!! A handicapped licensed plate driver drove right into the wall where I was taking out garbage!
2010-07-31‎I just jumped out of the way. Holy christ, he was fine but I was in shock. Im fine. Man that was too close!
2010-07-31‎@synthplaya Sorry that I missed it, I had to work seven hours today.
2010-07-31‎"So Twitter has now added a ""More Like *username*"" thinger on the sidebar on profile pages. What's the point of it?"
2010-07-31‎@techofnh Im up editing!
2010-07-31‎Okay so movie maker has froze on me over three times tonight, WTF????
2010-07-31‎Good thing I save frequently but another reason why I want iMovie lol
2010-07-31‎Been up editing all night. I feel like @shanedawson lol
2010-07-31‎You know it's sad. I spent five hours editing until 4am and I didnt even get 1/4 way finished with the video......
2010-07-31‎@Arkhalow Congrats  =)
2010-07-31‎But mainly because there is some technical editing that had to be done multiple times. So far it's turning out great but it's taking a while
2010-07-31‎@EmptyIsAwesome @freakshow180 Thats spam for ya
2010-07-30‎I personally dont like the new bottom bar on videos now. Not the description bar, the subscription bar. It is a pain in the ass.
2010-07-30‎@imatu777 I dont like it there, period. It draws you away from watching the video.
2010-07-30‎Reactivated my website. Yeah, I have a website lol going to start putting some neat stuff on there in the coming weeks - http://bit.ly/N7jPF
2010-07-30‎"You can leave me a comment on what you think of it ""so far"" in its early stages on the ""Leave a Comment"" page."
2010-07-30‎@imatu777 I actually saw an old guestbook comment from you from last June on there lol
2010-07-30‎@PointBaron You're getting subscribers like crazy! Thats great  =)
2010-07-30‎Im going to have to upload the collab Saturday possibly. But I might hold off until Tuesday since I fucking work the next four days.
2010-07-30‎I will edit all I have tonight. If I get the final footage to me Saturday I may be able to upload Monday. Tuesday would be better; day off.
2010-07-30‎*TEASER* Trailer for the collab - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1UN1SP42pY
2010-07-29‎@CrazyTechDude I applied months ago and still nothing
2010-07-29‎Still waiting on 9 clips and Alligator voice. I wanted this up July 31st. Still have some hope.
2010-07-29‎@jaelentruong It is a great song  =)
2010-07-29‎@makemebad35 mine glitches saying Im subd to 1 person sometimes and yeah WTF? I also cant remove a closed account subscriber.
2010-07-29‎@synthplaya Ah I cant, Im working, thought you were going Live yesterday but apparently you got your mac today
2010-07-28‎Only thing that sucks about this collab is that there's 20 clips that have to be sent to me, five at a time. Takes a while lol
2010-07-28‎@PointBaron Sorry cant let anyone see it, just between me and Damian
2010-07-28‎@Kungfualice Happy 21st! Drinks all around!
2010-07-28‎@nnaatteeks I was only on for a half hour. Need to get to work editing.
2010-07-28‎@nnaatteeks It is turning out great so far, but Im still waiting on 15 more clips...yeah 15  :X
2010-07-28‎@nnaatteeks Well Damian botched a lot of the opening scenes lol but yeah lots of footage. He can only send five at a time.
2010-07-28‎Few more days! http://twitpic.com/29hc3v
2010-07-28‎I have 8 minutes of makemebad bloopers and still have 10 clips to receive. Oh boy I can only imagine the bloopers coming XD
2010-07-27‎@CrazyTechDude Thank you lol
2010-07-27‎Alright, thanks guys!  =)
2010-07-27‎@freakshow180 I have no idea who owns the account but I blocked it
2010-07-27‎@synthplaya Thank you much!
2010-07-27‎Finally after weeks of waiting, I am finally going to film today  =)
2010-07-27‎Word is from Damian, PLENTY OF BLOOPERS. Def. making a second video with extras/bloopers  =)

2010-07-27‎Thats lovely, just choked on spaghetti and a tiny meatball came out my nose 5 minutes later....
2010-07-27‎@smoshanthony I hate the suspense of not know the poll percentage X(
2010-07-27‎Off work the next two days, praying I can film then. Damian is sending me his footage tonight I believe. Cant wait to edit =)
2010-07-27‎@SmoshIan I miss when we didnt have to vote, why cant Anthony just think of his own food?

2010-07-27‎@imatu777 Someone else already got to me but you can too. Crop out the Horse - http://twitpic.com/1zalyo
2010-07-27‎@synthplaya Okay so I will have three copies, maybe one will be better than the other  =)

2010-07-26‎@freakshow180 For my future I will most likely have to move, if I want to be in the electronic media field.
2010-07-26‎@kungfualice Go for it someday, you'd be surprised how many people would watch.
2010-07-26‎@freakshow180 I just for some reason hate New York. Not like hate it in general, just I dont like the city and all. It's just nasty.

2010-07-21‎@freakshow180 If only Vidcon was in NY instead of LA.
2010-07-21‎@freakshow180 Probably because they're going into the film industry if they moved there. Not sure how many actually grew up there.

2010-07-18‎@Nighty74 I've reported the issue before but they havent fixed it yet. Hmmm....
2010-07-18‎@synthplaya lol thats really strange
2010-07-18‎@imatu777 The funny thing is neither of my grandparents have a cat. And the c011ab channel story is complicated.
2010-07-18‎@imatu777 It was me and six other users, pju129d included. Everyone (the six users) knew the password. Pju changed it on us & took over.
2010-07-18‎@imatu777 Eventually he closed it. I was on another collab channel previously but havent since. It's too much work.
2010-07-18‎Anyone know if there is way to automatically shorten links on tweets without going to a http://bit.ly/ website? I know on tweetdeck you can.

2010-07-16‎@makemebad35 And the ear thing means you have fluid in there. It can make you light headed, Ive had it. It's probably an ear infection.
2010-07-16‎@TonnySapiano Certainly  =)

2010-06-26‎@freakshow180 Onision blocked me lol
2010-06-26‎@synthplaya That would be awesome if he did
2010-06-26‎@makemebad35 Did you see the giant feud between Onision and Emptyisawesome on twitter? Look at their pages.
2010-06-26‎@makemebad35 Yeah it was crazy

2010-06-26‎@makemebad35 Well I mean mine took like an hour to get to 100% once, but every one is different. Just keep checking your my_videos section

2010-06-26‎@freakshow180 Damn just saw it, dont see that often
2010-06-26‎@daveofnh Yes I saw it. Dont worry about it.
2010-06-26‎@freakshow180 I for one dont like Shay Carl and especially the ShayTards channel but yeah I will keep a lookout.
2010-06-26‎@synthplaya Dont worry about it =P
2010-06-26‎@EmptyIsAwesome One thing's for certain, you could be an Onision troll
2010-06-26‎@EmptyIsAwesome He is making it worse by doing what he always does when he's pissed, keep rambling on and repeating the problem
2010-06-26‎@shanedawson Well said
2010-06-26‎@imatu777 Ugh dont bother lol I said I'd use the site again once I got more popular on YouTube
2010-06-26‎@daveofnh My website that I made last year
2010-06-26‎@Onision Man just cut it already. Everyone you're tweeting to get's what you're trying to say and others disagree. This is ridiculous.
2010-06-26‎@daveofnh This is a crazy war
2010-06-26‎@daveofnh Well I said what needed to be said. Im done lol this is just out of everyone's context. Let Empty and Onision rant and bitch.
2010-06-26‎This is a huge war between emptyisawesome and Onision. Man I havent seen shit like this before.
2010-06-26‎@freakshow180 I'm gonna feel so bad for that kid when he grows up knowing this =P
2010-06-26‎@freakshow180 lol I know. I mean I shouldnt be laughing but this day is just weirdest Ive had in ages.
2010-06-26‎@freakshow180 It's the day MJ died, I scratched my car, and now this.
2010-06-26‎@daveofnh Yes, ugh I cant turn my twitter off, I want to keep watching this lol
2010-06-26‎@daveofnh Poor synthplaya is going to wake up to over 30 tweet updates on his phone :X
2010-06-26‎@daveofnh That's why I only have device updates on for one user lol
2010-06-26‎@EmptyIsAwesome Well thanks for the show. This is the longest I've ever looked at my twitter hitting refresh endlessly to see whats next =)
2010-06-26‎@freakshow180 lmfao we're going to remember this for a long time
2010-06-26‎RT @freakshow180: The motherfucking rocktard dick war
2010-06-26‎Sorry to those who have device updates on for me lol you probably will have over thirty text messages =P You're welcome!
2010-06-26‎Onision is still tweeting?! OMFG I dont even care anymore lol
2010-06-26‎@synthplaya That was a huge war lol
2010-06-26‎@Nikkihennigan Device updates? Sorry lol that NEVER happens. I never tweet that much lol but that was a huge war
2010-06-26‎@Nighty74 All I really talked about was the collab and my car that I scratched
2010-06-26‎@Nighty74 Yes, that was an impersonator but I reported it. So glad youtube was ready for that one. It was gone within a few hours.
2010-06-26‎#Iwasinemptyandonisionstwitterwar @Emptyisawesome
2010-06-26‎@Nighty74 Yeah, I got work tonight AND five days next week. It's going to be hectic because of Fourth of July.
2010-06-26‎@synthplaya He's followed pretty much anybody who's at replied him last night I noticed
2010-06-26‎@synthplaya Maybe he follows every one that follows him
2010-06-26‎@Nighty74 Dont worry about it though, everyone knows I only tweet when I make a new account. But I wont be making new accounts for eons.
2010-06-26‎@shanedawson That humping dog made me rofl and dont fuck with MJ, lol keep it up man!
2010-06-25‎"It isnt ""totaled"". It's badly scratched on the one back end. There's two little holes though :X  fuck me"
2010-06-25‎@synthplaya True but my parents are gonna kill me.
2010-06-25‎"The irony is I pulled in forwards and thought, ""I should back out and back in"". Backed in too close to the rock wall *Boosh* SCRATCH!!!"
2010-06-25‎@synthplaya It's always fun until this happens :X
2010-06-25‎car scratched http://twitpic.com/1zwrsd
2010-06-25‎The good news about the car is it was the bumper that got scratched; it's plastic. We're prob. not going to replace it. Could've been worse.
2010-06-25‎Getting lots of good suggestions. Keep submitting if you can! - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksXcL1jHzu8

2010-06-25‎Anyone know how I would bluescreen myself so it would look like I was in a different room?
2010-06-25‎@PointBaron I dont use Vegas. I use......Movie Maker =P
2010-06-25‎@synthplaya I have a chroma key for bluescreen for movie maker
2010-06-25‎@synthplaya Because I thought I could make it look like I (and horse head) were in Damian's house. Like he could send me a pic of the room.
2010-06-25‎@freakshow180 lmao thanks for submitting
2010-06-25‎@freakshow180 I've got to have something blue thats big lying around. I tried the wall itself in my room but it looked gray on camera.
2010-06-25‎"@synthplaya What do you mean by ""effects""?"
2010-06-25‎@PointBaron lol
2010-06-25‎@imatu777 Yes lol the one with skyeatsgoodairplanes was glitchy for some reason =P
2010-06-25‎@imatu777 That collab makes me look a lot younger
2010-06-25‎@synthplaya I just need to know how to bluescreen myself the way I asked lol but I will def. take a look into those effects
2010-06-25‎@imatu777 Okay so I did a test film of me in front of some blue towels stepped away to get a shot of just the towels. Am I doing it right?
2010-06-25‎@synthplaya Ah I see
2010-06-25‎@synthplaya Okay so I did a test film of me in front of some blue towels stepped away to get a shot of just the towels. Am I doing it right?

2010-06-25‎"@synthplaya ""then apply the blue screen"""
2010-06-25‎@imatu777 Okay I'll give it a go
2010-06-25‎Thanks for all of the help =) @synthplaya is probably getting updates off the hook =P
2010-06-25‎@Imatu777 lol well I want to do things correctly
2010-06-25‎@synthplaya It's been lagging for my DM's and @replys too and I will do my test now to see if it works
2010-06-25‎@imatu777 Didnt work :X
2010-06-25‎@synthplaya I'll send you the clip tomorrow to see if you can get it to work
2010-06-25‎@imatu777 I took the clip of me in front of the blue towels and then added a picture after it in the timeline and dropped the bluescreen
2010-06-25‎@imatu777 effect between them
2010-06-25‎Forget the bluescreen idea, I would need an actual blue or green screen.
2010-06-25‎@daveofnh lmao
2010-06-25‎OMFG I just totaled the back end of my car. I backed into my driveway and hit the rock wall. FUCK ME! There goes my months paycheck I'll bet
2010-06-25‎@imatu777 Yeah I recorded on my flip after it happened.
2010-06-25‎I cant take a picture because my phone camera doesnt work but I got it on my Flip cam.

2010-06-15‎Say goodbye to the sides of my hair, they will be changed tomorrow =)
2010-06-15‎@synthplaya Another thing would have to be a Mac computer. I've been thinking of switching, especially since PC's are obsolete for editing
2010-06-15‎@synthplaya Damian says that Mac's are the way to go for serious film making b/c PC's dont have great editing softwares. So thats the plan.
2010-06-15‎Well my hair is short again. Huge chunks fell off when she was cutting it! My sides are straighter now.
2010-06-15‎@makemebad35 you should have turned the lights on

2010-05-29‎@kajaproductions It's Knoebels in Elysberg, Pa
2010-05-29‎Well it's been about four hours since I bought the drinks and now they're just about gone. Man why couldnt they be cheaper?!
2010-05-29‎I'm up this early to go to an amusement park and I'm bringing my Flip Cam.
2010-05-29‎That will be a new main channel video because I will be going away for a week so I want to get another one in.I know it isnt my normal stuff
2010-05-29‎@livinginthenorm I'm leaving for South Carolina NEXT Saturday. I will try to go Live. Im not sure how long I will be at the amusement park.
2010-05-29‎@livinginthenorm Or IDK if I will be physically exhausted. IDK we'll see.
2010-05-29‎Finally arrived at Knoebels. Time to start filming!
2010-05-28‎I think I have a writer's block.....
2010-05-28‎@synthplaya Im not really that good at vlogs =P  I tend to stay away from them.
2010-05-28‎@synthplaya Although I will be doing a 2 year anniversary vlog next week
2010-05-28‎@freakshow180 lol think I'll pass on that one
2010-05-28‎@synthplaya I just wish it wouldnt run long but it will probably be an eight minute vlog because it's my YouTube story.

2010-04-23‎Shout Outs!  on my main channel - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53PYe_sAMMU
2010-04-23‎@livinginthenorm No idea how it still works, however the pictures come out bright green & purple. Oh well, it's only for a month.
2010-04-23‎@livinginthenorm Yes, I got to start looking into new ones
2010-04-23‎Remember that good phone of mine that drowned last Fathers Day? I can actually use it for the next month because miraculously it works now!

2010-04-23‎@imatu777 When I grabbed it out of the pool and took a pic, the picture colors came out just like your profile pic lmao
2010-04-23‎@freakshow180 No idea lol guess it needed a ten month rest to drain all of the water out haha
2010-04-23‎@freakshow180 Theres still a clip of when Chris used to sit at our table :O

2010-04-23‎@PointBaron It wasnt a random guy, it was an old friend lol
2010-04-22‎Man this is killing me because I dont have anymore free days to film. I would only have 30 mins on Friday and that isnt nearly enough.
2010-04-22‎I might pull the plug on this video now, make a different one, and then go back to this one. It will take lots of time with the effects.
2010-04-22‎@livinginthenorm lol not within the next few months. It's quite difficult to gather over ten members to film on a specific date. Ideas also.
2010-04-22‎@livinginthenorm It needs to be a substantial amount. Weather is also huge. Summer is always best.
2010-04-22‎@PointBaron I swear you come up with the most random shit lol
2010-04-22‎@SmoshIan lmao
2010-04-21‎@marccolombo going to the Titans game on October 10th  =)

2010-03-19‎@Nighty74 It doesnt matter about the views, just people liking to help out  is nice  =)
2010-03-18‎@makemebad35 too short?
2010-03-18‎Going to try to edit this evening. Im praying this video doesnt get flagged.
2010-03-18‎@ROLFFilms I had that too but it was only on my main channel. IDK if its b/c I applied for partnership.
2010-03-18‎@Nighty74 Just watched it lmao but the sad thing is, his hair is now pretty much as long as mine and Im planning on a cut in a few weeks
2010-03-18‎Im coming clean. I am not going to make anymore channels. I am def. biting off more than I can chew.
2010-03-18‎My main, second, and MeanBruno channel will remain. All other additional channels are going to be removed.
2010-03-18‎It's just too much. Channels removed (ChipTheAngryTeenager & VivaLaFatass). I will keep MeanBruno.
2010-03-18‎@makemebad35 ur video wasnt in my sub box. I noticed you arent getting lots of comments & ratings like usual. That happened to me (0%)
2010-03-18‎@Nighty74 I stopped filming for that channel ages ago but it is still up. I privated all of the videos.
2010-03-18‎@kajaproductions But it's on his channel
2010-03-18‎Just filmed a crazy video. You guys will enjoy this. It should be up Friday, maybe tomorrow!
2010-03-18‎I see YouTube is changing its format a tad for comments and such and also under the account page, etc.
2010-03-18‎I hate this new YouTube comments thing. Its so much more work to use it, especially when the comments dont load and you cant see your text.
2010-03-17‎If you guys have stunt ideas for VivaLaFatass feel free to suggest!
2010-03-17‎@ROLFFilms Thanks for the NiftGifty
2010-03-17‎Happy St. Patrick's Day!

2010-03-02‎"I never thought i would see the word ""masterbate"" in the German dictionary."

2010-03-02‎@kajaproductions I left early, about 2 hours early. I had my mom pick me up.
2010-03-02‎@livinginthenorm No I had school, I left early (not the entire school). My mom picked me up.
2010-03-02‎People are a little confused. I left school early (it was a full day; my mom picked me up to leave early to go skiing).
2010-03-02‎"Well finally after 10 months since I uploaded it, I finally decided to AudioSwap""Jack The Retarded Kid"",especially after I did my fundraiser"
2010-03-02‎The character was a mistake from the very beginning.All of the Jack vids are privated except for the original.Im sorry if I offended anyone.
2010-03-02‎@bloodycheater Thats a shock; you're one of a select few who like those videos =P
2010-03-02‎The video got over 4,000 views but still I dont feel right having that video up. I will leave it up but swap the audio.
2010-03-02‎@PointBaron Well I hate making fun of people like that and being that my cousin is autistic, it just makes me feel bad. Plus the vids sucked
2010-03-02‎I wrote a short apology in the description of the video - http://bit.ly/9EybRD it doesnt apply to all of you but still
2010-03-02‎@PointBaron It is no laughing matter you know? My whole senior project was on Autism research. So I said what had to be said.
2010-03-01‎Going to upload a new second channel video Tuesday
2010-03-01‎It includes your @replies about my fundraiser.
2010-03-01‎@TheCyberAce Thanks man =)
2010-03-01‎"@makemebad35 How did you request the ""damian"" channel? Did you contact youtube somehow? If so how? Or was the user active still?"
2010-03-01‎@synthplaya Damian didnt create it, he got it from someone else or YouTube gave it to him. I just want to know how if he requested it fromYT
2010-03-01‎@synthplaya lmao I remember you mentioning that months ago, it's still funny that they havent given it to you yet
2010-03-01‎@synthplaya lol

2010-03-01‎@synthplaya I can probably do it Friday, Wednesday is a no-go. It depends if my brother babysits with his gf one of these weekdays.
2010-03-01‎@synthplaya If he babysits I can do it any of the weekdays.
2010-03-01‎@synthplaya Alright gotcha. I am going to get a second channel video out Tuesday. I doubt I will have a MeanBruno video filmed this week
2010-03-01‎@synthplaya So I def. will get to it this week
2010-03-01‎@PointBaron They were number one until Fred just sparked outta nowhere and same with Nigahiga. 2008 made me sad lol

2010-02-26‎&gt;@synthplaya lol @kajaproductions lol and @muscleryan LOL!
2010-02-26‎Going to try editing again today. Remember yesterday I couldnt save it. I'll try my best to figure out the problem.
2010-02-26‎"@yosoyian The problem is I cant save at all. When I click the ""Save"" button it gives me the error report. I can save the ""movie"" (rendering)"
2010-02-26‎@yosoyian But I would be nervous if I edit the whole thing and try that it wont work. That would really suck but I will have to do it
2010-02-26‎@MrCrazyk33 I use Windows Movie Maker but was starting to use Vegas Pro 9. I uninstalled it because I downloaded it for free.
2010-02-26‎"New blog post on MySpace - http://www.myspace.com/pioneersproductions  ""Crazy Progression"""
2010-02-26‎The other thing I hate about my Windows Movie Maker is I can only open it like twice before I have to restart my computer to use WMM again
2010-02-26‎@MrCrazyk33 There's a complicated way to download it for free but dont do it, it might fuck up your computer
2010-02-26‎@Mtkd3 @yosoyian Thanks for the follow friday =)
2010-02-26‎Okay so after I uploaded the Help video my voice got pitched lower and lower as the video went on WTF?
2010-02-26‎I will go LIVE around 6pm ET so you guys can give me feedback because this is just weird!
2010-02-26‎@TheCyberAce But I did defragment and disk cleanup and stuff. I have virus programs. I will try scanning.
2010-02-26‎@smoshanthony @SmoshIan @smosh Hilarious, GOD DAMMIT EDITOR!
2010-02-26‎Doing virus scans; hope this works!
2010-02-26‎@Nighty74 It turned glitchy. Half way through my voice got pitched lower somehow. I have no idea why.
2010-02-26‎@synthplaya I cant save of import or export files in anything without it X'ing right out or getting error reports
2010-02-26‎@Nighty74 Give it time. Like an hour
2010-02-26‎@Nighty74 kk
2010-02-26‎@synthplaya I think you meant to @reply me haha no but I have two scanners. One's almost done.
2010-02-26‎Yes, it worked! Thank you virus scanners!
2010-02-26‎I will upload tomorrow, it would be up pretty late for HD.
2010-02-25‎@JohnnyEatsPants Thats what I'll probably have to do. Im just nervous that I will edit the whole video and do that and it wont work.
2010-02-25‎@PointBaron Oh thats the worst!
2010-02-25‎@kajaproductions It is on Friday

2010-02-25‎Editing the new video. You guys will like this one better than all of my others possibly =)
2010-02-25‎Oh no, I'm having problems editing. As soon as I open WMM or Vegas it X's right out. Doing a disk cleanup and stuff.  =P
2010-02-25‎Looks like Im not going to be able to get this video up tonight. Whenever I click the save button the whole page X's out, WTF?!
2010-02-25‎"@Nighty74 There is a ""run as.."" option. I tried it but still didnt work."
2010-02-24‎"New video on my second channel ""Classes & American Eagle"" http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UbJGpHQqWA"
2010-02-24‎@synthplaya Today went pretty fast for a change
2010-02-24‎@LucasCruikshank You dissect anything yet?
2010-02-24‎@makemebad35 My situation is a tad different but I had a video that was copyrighted for music over a year after I posted it.
2010-02-24‎@makemebad35 And it was the HALLOWEEN theme song. It's a well known song. IDK why it took YouTube over a year to copyright it.
2010-02-24‎@makemebad35 Still, thats different than your situation but yeah, kinda similar
2010-02-24‎@thewillofdc Holy shit, congrats on 100,000!
2010-02-24‎@makemebad35 Videos on private cant be copyrighted? You sure on that? I have audioswapped so many videos from a year ago b/c of music.
2010-02-24‎@kajaproductions Are you serious? Awesome man! I know TheCyberAce was in Davedays new Dave video
2010-02-24‎@makemebad35 Now Im hungry
2010-02-24‎@synthplaya I went that day for supper and got the Grand Slam but of course it wasnt free haha
2010-02-24‎@synthplaya It ended at 2pm
2010-02-24‎Word is we're supposed to get a foot of snow tonight. No school tomorrow and Friday they think =)
2010-02-24‎So SuperMac18 quit YouTube? Why?! He had over 247,000 subs! I never really watched his vids though...
2010-02-24‎@synthplaya No but I saw thewillofdc say that in an @reply. IDK if his twitter is supermac18 but if it is, it is blank (twitter).
2010-02-24‎@synthplaya His YouTube just has his videos. His description, last sign in, and stuff are hidden. No modules.
2010-02-24‎@TheCyberAce The willofdc @replied makemebad35 saying that but Im its still a mystery.
2010-02-24‎Just a few words from me - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Elp05LDpyw
2010-02-24‎@ROLFFilms I swear you had more?
2010-02-24‎@PointBaron I will be LIVE at 7pm ET.
2010-02-24‎Tonight is my final Wednesday LIVE show. There is a schedule change, watch it here - http://www.blogtv.com/people/PioneersProductionsBlog
2010-02-24‎Oh Im sorry guys, give it a little time to process. It isnt even on the BlogTv page yet lol
2010-02-24‎@ROLFFilms Oh I know about your subs but it just seems like you would have hundreds of followers not just 100
2010-02-24‎@makemebad35 LIVE tonight at 7pm, can you maybe stop in? comment here if you will http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Elp05LDpyw
2010-02-23‎@nalts lmao

2010-02-23‎New video on my second channel tomorrow =)
2010-02-23‎@makemebad35 So I've noticed lol even on Facebook. You have like 10 favorited parrot vids lmao they are funny though XD

2010-02-22‎@synthplaya It's a Twitter Ap for iPhone and just a computer that updates itself showing you tweets LIVE
2010-02-22‎OMG scheduling classes for senior year is so annoying! You need 8 credits. A semester (2 marking periods) class is 1.0 credit.
2010-02-22‎I have like 10 quarter classes and Im one credit short. Ugh IDK what to take. This sucks. So many quarter classes and semester classes.
2010-02-22‎I dont want math (Im done with every subject). I dont want Forensics or Chemistry. IDK if I should take Intro To Theater.

2010-02-15‎@synthplaya I've heard from some people that they are bot comments. LisaNova used to (or still does) issue bot comments.
2010-02-15‎@synthplaya When they arent actual comments from the user. A computer comments what the user wanted to put in automatically.
2010-02-15‎@synthplaya Usually on nonpopular channels like my ex-friend's. Look --&gt; http://www.youtube.com/user/gilbydude154

2010-02-09‎@makemebad35 when u import your FLIP HD onto ur computer, are the clips in reverse order?
2010-02-09‎What the heck, this is like a mixed reaction. Some say they are imported in order and others are the opposite reaction. Thanks for feedback.
2010-02-09‎Finally figured it out everyone =) I used the old converter that I used for my older camera and it worked fine.
2010-02-09‎"Looks like no school tomorrow, 4"" - 8"" inches expected  =)"
2010-02-09‎New video will be Wednesday, I am 100% sure that I will upload it  =)
2010-02-09‎@synthplaya Flip HD's are great. I almost want to use it over my Sanyo HD. It even looks better for darker shots, compared to my Yodels vid.
2010-02-09‎@synthplaya But to buy and use it over the Cannon? Not sure because I've never used that camera.
2010-02-09‎@muscleryan lmao that is crazy
2010-02-09‎@livinginthenorm I know there are schools out there like that. My cousins in Montana always have school no matter what. They'll get delays.
2010-02-09‎@makemebad35 i wish but i wouldve had to wake up at 530am lol
2010-02-09‎Wish i had a free GRAND SLAM today
2010-02-09‎http://twitpic.com/12agn7 - Chocolate shadow cake! Mmmm....

2010-02-08‎This video doesnt make much sense so far but at least it is different
2010-02-08‎There has never been an OT in the Super Bowl. We might have the first tonight  =)  Okay Peyton, time to prove you're the best! Go Saints!

2010-02-08‎@synthplaya It aint over till it's over
2010-02-08‎@makemebad35 Wasnt it smpfilms?
2010-02-08‎@livinginthenorm Go Saints!!!
2010-02-08‎Congrats to the Saints!!!!
2010-02-08‎Yet I feel empty inside because the NFL season is over #SuperBowlXLIV  @makemebad35
2010-02-08‎@makemebad35 Im so sorry man =(
2010-02-08‎Man I wish schools would issue day off's the day after the Super Bowl.
2010-02-08‎@kajaproductions Im a Cowboys fan but I was rooting for the Saints; sick of the Colts always winning.
2010-02-08‎@kajaproductions Plus some high schoolers get hungover and dont want to go to school. They should issue day offs.
2010-02-08‎http://twitpic.com/122dos - A project I did in Photoshop for class
2010-02-08‎Never thought Id come home and have to soak my foot in hot water. My leg, foot, and back are killing me X(
2010-02-08‎WTF I imported my footage from my Flip HD and the order was reversed. Ugh there are 65 clips and they were imported from end to beginning X(
2010-02-08‎@makemebad35 When you import your Flip HD footage, is it imported with the ending clips first and goes in reverse order?

2010-02-07‎@EmptyIsAwesome TMI lol why would you tweet that XD
2010-02-07‎@Onision You should make it so you can preview your music before downloading it on your website. I hate having to download it to preview it.
2010-02-07‎@livinginthenorm Not like serious like effects or anything just a serious skit
2010-02-07‎Made up my mind. I'm going to film a video tonight that I will upload this week. I will put the Horse Head video on hold.

2010-02-01‎@ROLFFilms Might lead to writer's blocks?
2010-02-01‎@PointBaron I've learned from the past. I used to upload once a week but that robs you of views and enables writers blocks.
2010-02-01‎@PointBaron But once every two - three weeks gets you more views and lets you think of new ideas off of other youtubers.
2010-02-01‎@PointBaron w00t!

2010-01-30‎"All I hear is CLUNK! ""Holy Shit, Holy Shit, Holy Shit, HOLY SHIT!"" I didnt realize what happened. She starts scrambling in the pot to get it"
2010-01-30‎I then realized it was her phone lmao The worst part was it was a pot of disgusting RAMEN remains in water. XD
2010-01-30‎So now me, my brother, and my mom have lost our cell phones due to some sort of water reaction XD My dad still hasnt had it happen to him.
2010-01-30‎@synthplaya I was laughing so hard when I realized what had happened. We both were.
2010-01-30‎Her phone was the NV3 or however you spell it.
2010-01-30‎@livinginthenorm It was extremely funny afterwards, Im still laughing. Luckily she has her Venus still.

2010-01-25‎@makemebad35 It would suck if the Vikings lose, I would miss possibly Favre's last game of his career.  X(
2010-01-25‎@makemebad35 Ugh you're making me anxious and I cant see the game! This sucks ass! lol they said my station suffered a power outage :X

2010-01-24‎@makemebad35 I'm praying New Orleans gets to the SB. If Favre gets there I hope Indy beats the living piss outta the Vikes.
2010-01-24‎@makemebad35 The Vikes are just one of those teams I cant stand
2010-01-24‎@makemebad35 Especially with Favre being there
2010-01-24‎@synthplaya Colts won 30-17
2010-01-24‎@synthplaya I cant stand Favre and the Vikes are just a team that strike a nerve with me
2010-01-23‎http://twitpic.com/zavte - Steepest slope on the mtn. Look at the moguls! Ive done it many times.

2010-01-23‎That slope might not look steep to you but it is an illusion. People have been killed on it. Takes lots of practice!
2010-01-23‎@smpfilms Thats nasty :X

2010-01-20‎I am going to ask a question related to the twitpic I just uploaded in just a few mins if you are good with Banjo-Kazooie trivia.
2010-01-20‎"Here is the question - ""What is the name of my profile playlist song on my MySpace?""  http://www.myspace.com/pioneersproductions"
2010-01-20‎That is a song from Banjo-Kazooie (first game). What world is it from?
2010-01-20‎&gt;@reply me with the correct answer for a shoutout on twitter
2010-01-20‎Nobody knows? Well the game is 10 years old.......
2010-01-20‎&gt;@flab149 guessed correctly! The song is from Mad Monster Mansion. Congrats =)   I didnt expect anyone to get it lol
2010-01-20‎@flab149 The game never gets old. I decided to download it on Xbox 360 since it was remastered and all compared to my N64.
2010-01-20‎@JooseEyzaguirre lol sorry 2 minutes too late ;(  but that is my fav. N64 game of all-time and the metal version is awesome.
2010-01-20‎@JooseEyzaguirre Nope
2010-01-20‎@ROLFFilms No it is NOT
2010-01-20‎@ROLFFilms I was looking for the metal version and ironically someone made one not too long ago

2010-01-19‎@livinginthenorm Well I doubt my parents would let me buy one being that I just bought the Sanyo HD last September.
2010-01-19‎@livinginthenorm I dont NEED one but it would be nice to have. They do have nice quality.
2010-01-19‎@livinginthenorm To be honest there's only one thing I hate about it. When there are shots of a darker scene the shot is fuzzy
2010-01-19‎@livinginthenorm Didnt you notice in my Yodels vid? Even in my makemebad35 collab, when its darker the picture goes fuzzy
2010-01-19‎@RANDUMBvids Thanks =)

2010-01-16‎For my next vid (not today's) I might do an ASK PIONEERS video where you guys can ask me weird-ass questions. I'll look into it.
2010-01-16‎@synthplaya And thats ok. If ur stuck, take a break. I made the mistake of uploading a vid once a week once.
2010-01-16‎@synthplaya The bad thing about once a week is that it gets less views than once every 2 1/2 - 3 weeks
2010-01-16‎@synthplaya Awesome!

2010-01-10‎That was scary, glad he's okay. Thank you snow for showing paw prints!!!!  =)
2010-01-10‎@Nighty74 He's fine
2010-01-09‎@makemebad35 Whoever unsubs because of one bad vid is a real asshole
2010-01-09‎@makemebad35 How many subs did you lose? 20-30?
2010-01-09‎@makemebad35 Maybe they just dont like the interviews in general?
2010-01-09‎@synthplaya Awesome!
2010-01-09‎@makemebad35 I know you only had one other one but maybe they just didnt like the idea from the very beginning. Oh well, best of luck =)
2010-01-09‎@kajaproductions lol true!
2010-01-09‎@makemebad35 I thought they were both crazy. None of your vids are bad.
2010-01-09‎@freakshow180 I'll pass
2010-01-09‎Man my finals week schedule is so confusing! Boy will I be glad when this week is over! Thursday is make-ups and Friday we have off =)
2010-01-09‎"Can you say ""5 day weekend""?  :D"
2010-01-09‎@Snuzzlescuf Welcome aboard =)
2010-01-09‎@MrCrazyk33 I am hoping I can skip Thursday since it is final exam make-ups but knowing my parents they would want me to go.
2010-01-09‎@twelthofadime Def. one of your best videos =)
2010-01-09‎@kajaproductions Oh I know. I've learned to ignore it because they all get suspended for impersonation anyways.IDK why they waste their time
2010-01-09‎http://twitpic.com/xb5ys - Bruno praying? Hard to see but hes sleeping with his paws together
2010-01-09‎@eyeofprod Yes you are lol
2010-01-09‎@smpfilms Ouch :X

2010-01-09‎@juliancheese No I dont
2010-01-09‎Ah the weekend, feels good =)
2010-01-09‎My dog just farted. Thats an 8.0 on the Richter Scale!

2010-01-09‎@smpfilms Great vid, hilarious!
2010-01-09‎@eyeofprod Damn you overslept lol
2010-01-09‎@eyeofprod They better win tonight or I will be the laughingstock at my school Monday. I live in Eagle country XP
2010-01-09‎@synthplaya Good luck!
2010-01-09‎No LIVE show tonight, gotta watch my Cowboys. I will be LIVE tomorrow night at 7pm ET instead.
2010-01-09‎http://twitpic.com/xei04 - Lmao
2010-01-09‎How did I lose 4 subs?
2010-01-09‎My first twitvid! http://twitvid.com/217BF
2010-01-09‎@MJWithers Is that a threat lol
2010-01-09‎Turn your volume up, it's hard to hear me talk: First twitvid! http://twitvid.com/217BF
2010-01-09‎@livinginthenorm w00t!
2010-01-09‎@makemebad35 Im not incredibly crazy about the interviews. Skit vids of your are better but at least its different
2010-01-08‎@makemebad35 I hit a lollipop stick right up into my throat on accident once in 6th grade and it killed! That sucks bro!
2010-01-08‎@ROLFFilms What happened?
2010-01-08‎@MrCrazyk33 No it isnt mine
2010-01-08‎@synthplaya Oh I know, it sucks but I shrug it off
2010-01-08‎@livinginthenorm Cross your fingers for snow!
2010-01-08‎@davedays w00t!
2010-01-08‎10 subscribers away from 1,000, this is crazy!
2010-01-08‎@ROLFFilms Thanks man!
2010-01-08‎I just hit 1,000 subscribers, thanks so much everyone and @ROLFFILMS for the tweet!
2010-01-08‎@eyeofprod I know it's fake, pju129d made it, like always X(
2010-01-08‎That means I only need 998,999 more subscribers until I reach 1,000,000 lol it would probably take a million days to get them XD
2010-01-08‎@davedays Somewhat
2010-01-08‎@synthplaya Thank you!
2010-01-08‎@synthplaya You'll get there!
2010-01-08‎@davedays You look different lol
2010-01-08‎Looked back at my channel comments, it took me approximately 3 weeks to get 100 subs.
2010-01-08‎http://twitpic.com/x5k9i - Thanks so much for 1,000 subs everyone!
2010-01-08‎@buckhollywood http://twitpic.com/x5khx - lmao!
2010-01-08‎"@yosoyian I was just going to say ""what?!"" lol thank you!"
2010-01-08‎@synthplaya What, for revenue sharing? Did you say whether or not there was music in it and stuff?
2010-01-08‎@synthplaya Hmm....did you leave anything blank? There was a section at the end that let you describe the vid.
2010-01-08‎@synthplaya My description was about 4-5 sentences long.
2010-01-08‎@synthplaya Hmm.....not sure
2010-01-08‎@synthplaya My vid took about a day to be approved
2010-01-08‎@synthplaya No I did NOT get an e-mail. I just got an e-mail saying it was approved and if I had questions, contact adsense or whatever
2010-01-08‎Thank God we got a delay!
2010-01-08‎@PointBaron w00t! And thanks!

2010-01-08‎@MrCrazyk33 Ohh sorry about that
2010-01-08‎@kenneth_weese Happy #FF lol
2010-01-08‎@smpfilms lmao!
2010-01-08‎I might start uploading some twitvids in the near future, be on the lookout!
2010-01-08‎http://twitvid.com/2193C - @smpfilms Down right hilarious XD
2010-01-08‎"@smosh ""Charlie the drunk guinea pig!"" Kind of catchy lol"
2010-01-07‎Ugh it just isnt happening. Screw that video idea. Ugh I will film a new one next Wednesday. It just wasnt as easy as I had hoped.
2010-01-07‎@makemebad35 Sorry to hear that =(
2010-01-07‎@livinginthenorm No, I wont be LIVE until Saturday or next wednesday
2010-01-07‎@tinychat Voted for you but IDK what a crunchie is lol
2010-01-07‎@livinginthenorm Was it saying a show is about to start or that I was LIVE? I recorded a promo saying I wasnt going to be LIVE
2010-01-07‎@livinginthenorm The other possibility is that I scheduled it but removed it, IDK
2010-01-07‎#RIPmoviemob
2010-01-07‎Anyone have no school today around the midwest? Snows coming here tonight
2010-01-06‎@yosoyian Ok thanks =)
2010-01-06‎@twelthofadime You're posting a video every week?
2010-01-06‎Crazy Fucking Christmas got approved for ad sharing on YouTube =) going to be able to make some money off of the ads :D
2010-01-06‎It autoplays on my channel. Click here to see the vid with ads: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xFBjSrGasbQ
2010-01-06‎@eyeofprod Aww =)
2010-01-06‎I decided to download Firefox in the meantime while I try to figure out how to unblock it in Internet Explorer.
2010-01-06‎@synthplaya Onision's music is not copyrighted, you just got to give credit to him in your video.
2010-01-06‎@synthplaya Freakshow uses his music all the time
2010-01-06‎@yosoyian It is a tear-jerker. I have a yellow lab and it really made my eyes water.
2010-01-06‎@kajaproductions w00t! Sweet dude!
2010-01-06‎@eyeofprod Well so far I made a penny XD
2010-01-06‎@synthplaya Go to onision.com  he has loads of different genres of music (suspense, drama, etc.) He changed the lists around sometimes
2010-01-06‎@synthplaya Right now he made it really unorganized compared to before but check it out if you want good free background music
2010-01-06‎@livinginthenorm I cant believe I didnt think of downloading firefox last night. Ugh I wasted my time using my parents computer.
2010-01-06‎"Just so everyone knows, I wasnt ""partnered"" on YouTube.I just got offered ad revenue sharring for my Xmas vid because it became popular fast"
2010-01-06‎That is why it is autoplaying. So I am not partnered. There was some confusion for some people so just thought I'd clear that up.
2010-01-06‎For those who dont understand, YouTube made this sharring for nonpartners to earn money off vids that grow popular quickly through AdSense.
2010-01-06‎"@synthplaya Just dont forget to mention ""Music By Onision"" in your video & sidebar or it is copyrighting. Other than that you're good to go"
2010-01-06‎@PointBaron I know its coming, hopefully the next time I apply, which I believe is February.
2010-01-06‎@eyeofprod I think I have to split the earnings with Google so if I got $200 I would only receive $100.
2010-01-06‎@smpfilms Aw dont let the haters get you down
2010-01-06‎@PointBaron Talent!
2010-01-06‎@kajaproductions w00t!
2010-01-06‎I might just stick to Firefox =)  It is faster and doesnt cut out like Internet Explorer. It also shows more YouTube depth
2010-01-06‎@ssavoy It was until I discovered firefox =)  before IE I used Netscape :X
2010-01-06‎@ssavoy lol I know, but that was back in 2000 2002ish when we finally got IE
2010-01-06‎Filming a new video tonight =)
2010-01-06‎I cant believe it hasnt even been two weeks since my Xmas vid (December 23rd)
2010-01-06‎It's cold!
2010-01-06‎Just so everyone knows, there will be NO Live show tonight. I need a break from the web cam. Still unsure if I will even be Live Saturday...
2010-01-06‎@kajaproductions I've always wanted to make one but I thought I would be copying people and they're hard to make.Should be interesting I bet
2010-01-06‎@MirroredTheory Am I allowed to post videos with your music as background music or do you copyright your music?
2010-01-06‎@makemebad35 I love Big Macs but that sounds nasty, no offense but I dont eve n know what it looks like
2010-01-06‎http://twitpic.com/wygpm - I love seeing this when i come home from school :D
2010-01-06‎The video I am going to film tonight is going to be hilarious. This character is going to say stuff that I dont normally say in vids
2010-01-06‎Going to be with two people and it will be a shocker. People might start calling me weird after this one, should be quite fun =)
2010-01-06‎@yosoyian I was asking on here for a new channel design / layout but if the background's good I may use it
2010-01-06‎@PointBaron lol
2010-01-05‎@MrCrazyk33 Yeah but it is because I RESTRICTED YouTube, thats why. I am trying to UNRESTRICT it
2010-01-05‎@kenneth_weese no
2010-01-05‎@kenneth_weese First time attempting to block an IP. I just was testing it but now I cant find the link in the restricted tab under Security
2010-01-05‎Im going to restart my computer. Wish me luck.
2010-01-05‎"Ugh it still doesnt show up in the restricted links. There are so many like it ""ynotube, yoogle, etc."" This sucks ass."
2010-01-05‎@eyeofprod I will give it a shot
2010-01-05‎OMG this is pissing me off, I will try other things tomorrow. Man how can I be so stupid X(
2010-01-05‎@ssavoy No I was testing blocking an IP address and I couldnt find youtube in the restricted sites
2010-01-05‎@yosoyian Will do
2010-01-05‎We had to watch Marley and Me first period, I literally almost cried
2010-01-05‎Down to my last resort for the restricted sites problem; Yahoo! Answers. XP
2010-01-05‎@kenneth_weese Right, I a mying Yahoo! Answers. Ive tried System Restore, Reinstalling my browser, and rebooting the computer.
2010-01-05‎If this doesnt work luckily I have two computers.
2010-01-05‎@annoyingorange lmao!
2010-01-05‎http://twitpic.com/wp864 - &gt;@smpfilms on scarred (right side)
2010-01-05‎I'm in big trouble guys, I went to block a YouTube IP address and it blocked youtube all together under the restricted sites
2010-01-05‎Under the restricted websites I cant find the youtube link, what do I do?!
2010-01-05‎@kenneth_weese I cant watch vids. It says you either have JavaScript turned off or you need to download Flash....etc that message
2010-01-05‎http://twitpic.com/wq16l - This is what I see, please I need your help on this.
2010-01-05‎@kenneth_weese Its b/c I blocked YouTubes IP Address but it was just a test and I can find it under the restricted sites. Theres hundreds
2010-01-05‎I cant even sign in to YouTube
2010-01-05‎@MrCrazyk33 I was trying to test blocking a channel's IP Address and I went to unblock it and the link wasnt there. Theres hundreds of links
2010-01-05‎@kenneth_weese I was testing blocking an IP address
2010-01-05‎@MrCrazyk33 It blocks YouTube itself, every channel and page.
2010-01-05‎@ROLFFilms Noooo I tried blocking an IP address on YouTube but I cant find the link in the restricted tab
2010-01-04‎Division champs! How bout them Cowboys!
2010-01-04‎@eyeofprod How 'bout them Cowboys!
2010-01-04‎@freakshow180 I know how you feel, we'll get through it
2010-01-04‎Which is better for the night before Monday? 1. Stay up as long as possible to live it up before you go to sleep OR (continued)
2010-01-04‎or go to sleep right away to get the school day overwith. I personally choose the first option. What about you guys?
2010-01-04‎@PointBaron lmao
2010-01-04‎Just filmed a very odd 10 minute vid for PioneersProductions2. I talked like Mole, the guy from the South Park Movie.
2010-01-04‎I explored my house at night and commentated on a lot of stuff in strange ways lol it will be up later this week.
2010-01-04‎That video is way different than what I normally do but thats why its going on my second channel. It is all one continuous shot. Its strange
2010-01-04‎@smpfilms lmfao!
2010-01-04‎@PointBaron Thats just nasty haha
2010-01-04‎@smpfilms i didnt know u were on SCARRED!
2010-01-04‎I never knew @smpfilms was on MTVs Scarred most f#cked up clip of the day. Thats awesome!
2010-01-04‎Skiing this Friday for the first time since last season, cant wait! I've been skiing since 3rd grade (8 years), never broke anything.....yet
2010-01-04‎@eyeofprod I killed Jack off but maybe a skiing video in the future?
2010-01-04‎@makemebad35 What day do you film movie mob?
2010-01-04‎@makemebad35 Oh they show the results now on the Movie Mob website. Last time I checked they never showed results.
2010-01-03‎Ah man I want to film this new video but I will have to wait until Wednesday, ugh!
2010-01-03‎@freakshow180 You've been at it recently =)
2010-01-03‎Thank you @PointBaron @ROLFFilms @Freakshow180 @Flab149 @LivingInTheNorm and whoever else had my back at my show, appreciate it =)
2010-01-03‎@synthplaya Big hate discussion about pju that might have ended it. Talking about our lives and the whole situation. Long story...
2010-01-03‎@PointBaron Thanks for the great speech on YouTube =)
2010-01-03‎@synthplaya Anyways, I know you would've had my back =) Had to watch ur vid again XD
2010-01-03‎@synthplaya Losing subs again?
2010-01-03‎@synthplaya That makes no sense. People say you RARELY lose subscribers. Are they spam bots? I have lost maybe 10 subs all-time.
2010-01-03‎Got offered ad revenue sharing on Crazy Fucking Christmas =)
2010-01-03‎I changed the title to Crazy Christmas just to be safe, because if it is approved I dont want YouTube flagging the title.
2010-01-03‎@ROLFFilms Love snow, hate shoveling it X(
2010-01-03‎http://twitpic.com/wjzju - Miss Pony returns!

2010-01-02‎Cant believe @EmptyIsAwesome quit YouTube. I loved his smashing chair humor.

2010-01-02‎@xXLiannaXx lol thats awesome, w00t!  haha
2010-01-02‎@MrCrazyk33 R.I.P
2010-01-02‎@MrCrazyk33 That Jack twitter is NOT mine

2009-12-27‎@jo129d That wasnt sarcasm, he DID feel a lot better
2009-12-27‎#QOTD coming up! If @eyeofprod gets it correct, he wins
2009-12-27‎#QOTD Besides KING OF THE HILL, what other animated cartoon did Mike Judge create? They had rock band names on their t-shirts.
2009-12-27‎&gt;@synthplaya guess correctly! It was BEAVIS AND BUTTHEAD! @synthplaya still has a chance to catch @eyeofprod for first place!
2009-12-27‎But synthplaya must win out, or if eyeofprod gets one more correct answer, eyeofprod will be the winnerr. It is a tight match!
2009-12-27‎@eyeofprod Ah if you would've guessed right you would have won the QOTD completely!

2009-12-26‎"#QOTD Who was the actor for Gilligan on the hit 60s TV series, ""GILLIGAN'S ISLAND""?"
2009-12-26‎&gt;@synthplaya guessed right again! The actor was Bob Denver. Thats 2pts for synthplaya!

2009-12-26‎(cont.) @RolfFilms 1pt   (so from Cheekyspook to RolfFilms, they have 1pt).
2009-12-26‎@synthplaya Same!
2009-12-26‎That means, if @eyeofprod gets one more answer correct, he will be the winner. If @synthplaya wins out, it will be a tie.
2009-12-26‎In the event of a tie, there will be one tiebreaker QOTD.
2009-12-26‎@synthplaya That would be hilarious if you won out
2009-12-26‎@livinginthenorm No even before you critiqued me I said it wasnt my favorite when I was replying to people, I think
2009-12-26‎@livinginthenorm I'm that that easy to upset about a vid lol it's the Internet, people are going to not like some vids :D
2009-12-26‎@synthplaya No, if eyeofprod gets one more right HE wins. You have to answer the next 6 QOTDs correctly to tie.
2009-12-26‎@synthplaya It aint over till it's over, it can be done

2009-12-22‎&gt;@livinginthenorm got it right, the answer is SKYPE. If @eyeofprod gets another question right he will be the winner.
2009-12-22‎@jo129d =P
2009-12-22‎"@jo129d You said ""sure"" as if I was lying"
2009-12-22‎Whoa my bad about the #QOTD, eyeofprod needs a few more correct answers to win for December X(
2009-12-22‎@TwatterOfTwiter Sorry, it was SKYPE X(  like your twitter name lol
2009-12-22‎@jo129d livingthenorm came up first on my twitter  =P  thats another reason why Im going to stop doing the QOTD after December
2009-12-21‎#QOTD coming up
2009-12-21‎#QOTD Which team does not belong in the AFC East: Patriots Dolphins Bills Steelers
2009-12-21‎&gt;@eyeofprod got it right! The answer is the Steelers. They are in the AFC NORTH.

2009-12-21‎If @eyeofprod (10pts) gets 5 more questions correct (in a row) he will be the winner. @synthplaya would NOT be able to catch him (3pts).
2009-12-21‎Ah man unbelievable with that Steelers touchdown X( but helps Dallas so Im happy
2009-12-21‎@makemebad35 Damn did you see that Steelers touchdown? Helps Dallas so Im happy but that was crazy
2009-12-21‎@makemebad35 PIT was down 36-30 with :03 left on their 16, Ben threw a strike to the WR on the side of the endzoneAlmost like the Super Bowl
2009-12-21‎@makemebad35 But it helps Dallas because now us and GB are (9-5). But I hate PIT, GB, and PHI

2009-12-16‎@synthplaya 30 seconds to appear on TweetDeck. IDK about the actual twitter page, but I use TweetDeck, updates itself
2009-12-16‎&gt;@eyeofprod is the winner, his username used to be @theeyebrandon but he had to change it. Just wanted to clarify that. lol
2009-12-16‎@PointBaron You know you dont have a profile image on your twitter?

2009-12-15‎@kajaproductions It is pju129d, he always makes fake accounts of me because I blocked him

2009-12-15‎@makemebad35 Well I am glad you got it back man =)
2009-12-15‎@MJWithers Ignore that JackRetard twitter, it is some guy I blocked from YouTube that impersonates me
2009-12-15‎@livinginthenorm I might stop doing it after this month
2009-12-15‎"New followers add me on MySpace: http://www.myspace.com/pioneersproductions  and Facebook:  ""Randy Stair"" &lt;--search for me"
2009-12-15‎@livinginthenorm It gets annoying sometimes. Plus I will upload a vid of the results so hopefully some people will get subs
2009-12-15‎@livinginthenorm But IDK if I could keep doing that every month. It just gets tiring, I guess...
2009-12-15‎@livinginthenorm Well it would get kinda weird uploading a vid about it at the end of each month. I want to give stuff away, not ask for fun
2009-12-15‎@livinginthenorm I just think one video like that can get some people subs
2009-12-15‎@livinginthenorm It just drags on and on. I still have 15 days to go for asking QOTDs. I just cant keep up with it.
2009-12-15‎@livinginthenorm Nah thats ok but thanks =)
2009-12-15‎@makemebad35 Better prices than Fred shirts lol I hate Fred
2009-12-15‎#QOTD coming up! I made a decision, after this month I will no longer be doing the QOTD.
2009-12-15‎Ah sorry guys gotta ask a different one. It wasnt fair because I deleted it and posted it multiple times b/c my Internet crashed.
2009-12-15‎#QOTD coming up....again!
2009-12-15‎#QOTD What is the name of the TV show where a man spends 7 days in the wilderness with NO camera crew, food, or water (most of the time).
2009-12-15‎You will also get a point for the name of the man who does the show
2009-12-15‎"&gt;@theeyebrandon got the show correct the fastest, ""SURVIVORMAN"". NOT man vs. wild or survivor. AND he guessed ""LES STROUD"". Thats 2pts!!!!"
2009-12-15‎Man that was a close one! Almost a dead tie between @theeyebrandon and @synthplaya
2009-12-14‎@livinginthenorm lol

2009-12-14‎Re-uploading it on my second channel. AudioSwapping the original
2009-12-14‎@livinginthenorm Well him and synthplaya usually answer the fastest. Maybe they have device updates on?
2009-12-14‎Thats so weird, whenever I re-upload a video the three thumbnails are different than the original vid, hmm.....

2009-12-12‎#QOTD coming up!
2009-12-12‎@yosoyian We left after the 2nd period. We were up 1-0. We're not big hockey fans. We like football. It just gets boring sometimes.
2009-12-12‎@yosoyian But the first 6 seconds of the game had 2 fights. 1 before they dropped the puck!
2009-12-12‎#QOTD What football team won SUPER BOWL XXXIX (39)?

2009-12-03‎@theeyebrandon Apparently Im a diaper wearing, spam pju's new vid
2009-12-03‎@theeyebrandon tammylkoo is pju on twitter
2009-12-02‎I want to be original, just uploading vids of myself, not cheating like that. So I decided to remove it. The last thing I need is copyrights
2009-12-02‎@theeyebrandon I had one for music on an old Chip vid from last winter and I think that might be it.
2009-12-02‎@theeyebrandon The Burglar 7 had a copyright for the HALLOWEEN theme but it wasnt removed or muted, IDK if that affects my record or not
2009-12-02‎I just want to be as careful as I can now uploading vids with music in them. I dont want to wake up to a suspended account ya know?
2009-12-02‎@theeyebrandon The Chip and Burglar vid but still, I removed a ton of vids with a little Simpsons theme in them too. Just being cautious
2009-12-02‎@theeyebrandon They were old vids that sucked anyways. I want to earn my views. They were old vids that I used to rig the view counter on
2009-12-02‎@synthplaya *smiles and shakes hand*
2009-12-02‎Plus I just removed some other older vids that werent even popular. My newer vids get more views anyways. The old ones had only 100-200

2009-11-28‎@theeyebrandon Well someone did during my Wednesday LIVE show remember? It wasnt Ebay, I think it might have been alec, not sure
2009-11-28‎@Jizzyfilms His older movies were better. I like Spanglish but it is a tie between Happy Gilmore and Bill Madison
2009-11-28‎I might do a Q & A video like makemebad35 did in the future. It would be fun to see what questions you guys would come up with!
2009-11-28‎And it might get you all some views =)   but still not sure if that will be my next vid or not
2009-11-28‎@jo129d I am stopping it until December 1st

2009-11-28‎Also, when I upload it, dont watch if you offend easily. This Chip video is a tad disturbing
2009-11-28‎Why does it take 45 minutes to render a 3 second video in Sony Vegas 9? Im just doing a test vid
2009-11-28‎@synthplaya Suggestion?
2009-11-28‎@synthplaya I think I figured it out, thanks =)

2009-11-26‎@awantoch  http://pic.gd/1c4a85 Put in lower left corner  hold on two more coming http://pic.gd/e98d18
2009-11-26‎@awantoch Put next to the websites but make them tiny http://pic.gd/50934c http://pic.gd/5778b7
2009-11-26‎@awantoch Lastly put this next to my profile image. But split this image in half and keep the makemebad35 side http://pic.gd/4210e9
2009-11-26‎@awantoch So for the makemebad pic keep his half but cut out my half
2009-11-26‎@joeiitzme I made added some pics to it but the size is too small so awantoch is trying to change the size. Its a pain lol
2009-11-26‎@RecklessMike Bananas!
2009-11-26‎If you guys never I saw it, I did a collab with makemebad35 http://bit.ly/qUO0A  &lt;--uploaded in September 2009

2009-11-26‎If any of you are on the computer and not eating your turkey, Question of the Day is coming up!
2009-11-26‎Oops typo in this question, gotta do another, there were actually two holidays X(
2009-11-26‎#QOTD  How many total subscribers do I have as of this minute?
2009-11-26‎Oh man, there is a three way tie between @awantoch @theeyebrandon and @synthplaya who guess the correct answer of 840  :O
2009-11-26‎And submitted simultaneously at 5:03pm ET. So it is a tie, congrats to @awantoch @theeyebrandon and @synthplaya!!!
2009-11-26‎@jo129d You said 847 or higher, you were wrong
2009-11-26‎I want to be able to give something away for the QOTD but I cant give subs away. I would need to create a new email and account every day X(
2009-11-26‎Suggestions?
2009-11-26‎@synthplaya lol
2009-11-26‎@theeyebrandon Ah well I would find out where people lived, I dont want that
2009-11-26‎@theeyebrandon That would be a good idea......I might do that in the future. Like still do the QOTD & then at the end of the month calculate
2009-11-26‎@jo129d I meant give away subs, but then again it would be fake so it wouldnt work out
2009-11-26‎&gt;@theeyebrandon brought up a good idea. At the start of every month I will do the QOTD each day and at the end of the month upload a vid
2009-11-26‎With the standings of the YouTubers (tweeters) with the most correct. Just like a standings list. And do the video at the end of each month
2009-11-26‎So I will do that. Starting December 1st I will begin calculating the users who guesses correct the fastest each day & upload vid@endofmonth
2009-11-26‎In that last tweet I meant AT the end of the month, not AT the user endofthemonth lol
2009-11-26‎@theeyebrandon lol you are very welcome =)
2009-11-26‎@jo129d You are texting to twitter apparently so ur messages take longer to get to me, so I didnt see yours until now
2009-11-26‎@jo129d But anyways nah I dont think I would do that because it is just like subs, if the same person gets it right, I would make new accnts
2009-11-26‎@jo129d So with theeyebrandons idea I CAN give away subs because hundreds of people will see the vid at the end of each month including u =)
2009-11-26‎@jo129d YOU could get subs
2009-11-26‎@jo129d Well hundreds of people will see the results and will most likely check out the channels
2009-11-25‎Check out the new vid for the C011ab channel http://bit.ly/92lhsy  by Jesterstone!
2009-11-25‎LIVE Thanksgiving Show tonight at 7pm ET http://www.blogtv.com/People/PioneersProductionsBlog  No dares just fun and talk

2009-11-24‎@MJWithers You're not alone XD
2009-11-24‎#QOTD What is the name of the Burglar from my videos? Send me an @reply with the correct answer for a shoutout on Twitter!
2009-11-24‎Ah man, I had to delete some videos because I got a copyright claim on my old video, The Burglar 4. I decided to delete all the burglar vids
2009-11-24‎I cant take the chance with copyrights anymore. So I removed all of my Burglar videos and some of my really old vids.
2009-11-24‎"Congrats to @theeyebrandon who guessed ""Hugh Jass""!"
2009-11-24‎@jo129d Wait, every single video that I ever uploaded?
2009-11-24‎As I was saying I have pretty much deleted every old video that contained some sort of music in it IDC how it will affect my partner chances
2009-11-24‎@PointBaron Well it was John Carpenter's HALLOWEEN theme song and I had it in most of my Burglar videos.
2009-11-24‎@PointBaron But for some odd reason, about 20 minutes ago I just got the copyright notice. I uploaded it in August 2008  WTF?
2009-11-24‎So I was sick of hating my old videos so I just decided to remove them. All except The Burglar, my first video. Read my channel comment post
2009-11-24‎http://www.youtube.com/user/PioneersProductions
2009-11-24‎@synthplaya I would just private them but I removed mine because of the possibility of future copyrights. I only have one old vid on private
2009-11-24‎@pointbaron lmao
2009-11-24‎Have a good day!
2009-11-24‎@warnazz I heard, glad to have you aboard =)

2009-11-19‎@synthplaya haha well.....it is kind of another makemebad knockoff but still funny.

2009-09-28‎So Wednesday, I will probably do a LIVE show on BlogTv
2009-09-28‎@thewaysofdruw Yoooooo

2009-09-28‎@synthplaya haha thanks and no problem, I'm sure you will, keep it up, man!
2009-09-28‎@synthplaya ok, it's been a WHILE since I went LIVE. I used to get 20+ people watching each show but then I got away from it b/c of summer
2009-09-28‎I wish I could put YouTube vids on a CD and watch them on my DVD player ;(
2009-09-28‎Decided to remove the LONG history of my channel description. It was way too long haha and distracting

2009-09-28‎@jo129d On a side note, I'm going to have to re-film the video, that is IF you still want to do the collab video. I need to know.
2009-09-28‎@jo129d Ok, I need to re-film it. I would need to send you about 3 different parts because of the size of the file
2009-09-28‎@jo129d I will try to do it Wednesday before I go LIVE. But the thing is, Im guessing I would have to edit the entire vid, idk if u can
2009-09-28‎Ugh, did anyone see those ugly Seattle Seahawks uniforms this afternoon :-P

2009-09-27‎@jo129d It needs to be 300mb or less. Its over 68 GB. Thats waaaaaaay too big. I would need to have u download it and convert it to WMV
2009-09-27‎@jo129d or whatever format that you use to edit. So its kind of a hairy situation right now.
2009-09-27‎To answer your makemebad35 FAQs http://bit.ly/12pGxp  I've been asked these questions 24/7
2009-09-27‎@jo129d I cant use that. It would display a watermark logo thinger in the middle of the video
