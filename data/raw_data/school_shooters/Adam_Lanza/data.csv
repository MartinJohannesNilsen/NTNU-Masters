2010-07-05‎My favorite two are Bloody Wednesday (It was significantly better than The Shining even with its many editing errors) and Stalking Laura. It’s impressively detailed for a “The following is based on a true story.” movie, like it’s the more fictionally-oriented Richard Farley version of Zero Hour. It’s my favorite movie of any genre.
2010-07-06‎I’m probably the only one here who would like Bloody Wednesday, but Stalking Laura is completely different. You should definitely see that one.
2010-07-06‎I had the same reaction. I was wondering “Where is this going?” when he was being chased in the hotel, and then the teddy bear suddenly blew me away. I originally found out about the movie by looking up George Sodini videos last year. One of them was the restaurant shooting scene with a title like “Pittsburgh shooting caught on security cameras”
2010-10-30‎I've been considering posting a topic sort of indirectly pertaining to the subject of gay bullying ever since Tyler Clementi killed himself, but I've been a bit hesitant because it will probably make me appear deranged.

2010-10-31‎I agree with NIN. Why would you be proud that you were born in a random place and sycophantically accepted being indoctrinated by the arbitrary beliefs your society imposed onto you? I have a lot of animosity for the notion of geographical culture.
2010-11-05‎You're attributing too much value to it. People change, and they say things which to begin with are either inaccurate or completely false.
2011-01-12‎While Jared Loughner apparently is one of the very few mass murderers who is legitimately delusional (Although I haven't completely determined that yet; crimes which receive a lot of media attention sort of irritate me and I usually defer reading about them for a while), he would have likely said exactly the same thing if Jared Loughner had been phenomenally eloquent. Like everyone, he advises to treat the symptoms rather than determining whatever causes there may be. Overall, he was fumbling around not saying anything meaningful. The way which this particular incident is being treated is frustrating to me. Jiverly Voong inflicted a similar number of casualties with more than double the deaths not too long ago, and he was virtually ignored compared to this. I hate how the lives of state-sanctioned thugs are treated as if they're more valuable than that of anyone else.
2010-01-22‎Edit: I'm sorry; I didn't see that. LS1's formatting is pretty unappealing so this was one of the extremely rare times where I didn't read the entire topic before posting.
2010-01-26‎I'm still waiting for a mass shooter who eschews 9mm pistols and instead buys an AK-47 pistol, 30 30-round magazines, and 1000 hollow points....
2011-01-27‎They would. Dead people in general receive more respect and blind compassion than they ever would have had while alive. I don't understand it.

2011-01-31‎I castrated myself when I was 15 to rebel against society.
2011-01-31‎It seems like an irrelevant question to be concerned about. No one can obtain knowledge about what happens after death, nor if anything is required to do for the deceased. If some ritual was necessary, no one could know about it nor have any knowledge about the requirements of it. Perhaps there's a magical platypus who requires that you burn a wooden effigy of a hamster so that the deceased can ride it to the gates of Valhalla. From observing other people who have died, the only conclusion which can be reached is that nothing happens. Treating death as if it's the end of everything would be the most prudent course of action because believing that something happens is contrary to the observable world of the life which you are certain about having, thus deluding you into behaving in a way which could negatively impact your life.
2011-01-31‎It's a loaded question which requires that you think of any of the relationships in your life, romantic or otherwise, in an immutable traditional context instead of an association of two particular individuals.
2011-01-31‎I'm sure that a reformed government could solve their problems.
2011-02-01‎(Incidentally, certain further evaluations which someone could have about the person who's kissing/asking were included for the answers (cute/chivalrous/throwing themselves/spontaneity/insecurity), but I'll pretend that the answers are only "Yes", "Maybe", and "No".) Perhaps I shouldn't have answered at all (especially considering how inaccurately I phrased it), but I'll try to describe what I meant: For anyone to give a meaningful answer to the fundamental question which I think you're asking ("Do you consider it generally desirable for someone to ask before kissing?") from which someone could potentially learn and modify their behavior accordingly, it would need to have an unimaginable number of variables and qualifiers. However, even if answers could be given for the impossibly detailed question, they would end up becoming meaningless because they would be so specific to the situation. That's why for the fundamental question to be reasonably asked, it understandably needs to include a particular scenario. In this case, it is a traditional end-of-date scenario between a potential romantic couple. That brings with it innumerable preconceived assumptions about the hypothetical relationship between the two people. We can only answer according to our interpretations of the context of the contrived relationship itself, eliminating the value of any of our answers. Basically, because of all of this, we can't accurately answer the question which you're really wanting to ask. I can't honestly answer with "Maybe". No matter how it is asked, I don't think that the fundamental question itself can ever be reasonably answered at all. Although it's possible that I'm genuinely not intelligent enough to figure out how I could provide an appropriate answer to the question.

2011-02-06‎I haven't looked into this much in the past couple of years, but I can think of a few reasons as to why he killed 1 and injured 19. I vaguely remember reading that most of the injuries were inflicted to limbs, which are rarely fatal. I also remember him complaining about this: "When My Rifle Misfires And I Gotta Stand There For 60 Seconds Waiting For It To Fire, Or Not". He was describing this: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hang_fire It's uncommon for high-quality ammunition to hang fire. If he was using the same cheap cartridges for his massacre, then the bullets were likely full metal jacketed. Beyond that, his 9mm Beretta Cx4 Storm innately wasn't a particularly effective firearm. The difference in velocity between a 9mm rifle and 9mm pistol is usually 15% at best. The benefits which a 9mm rifle has for a novice are basically its reduced recoil and greater distance between the front and rear sights. It allows faster and more accurate shots, although that was inconsequential for Kimveer Gill if he was aiming as poorly as I assume he was
2011-04-15‎You believe that a degenerate capitalistic system results in a commodification of sexuality. This enables the creation of a cultural notion that premarital sexuality is acceptable. This results in sexuality becoming widespread. This has three primary consequences: The first is that there are some males who believe that the existence of this attitude of sexuality is a justification of date rape, which causes instances of it to increase. The second is that the existence of this attitude destroys the significance of marriages. Fewer people get married, and of the people who do get married, more divorce. The third is that the prevalence of sexuality results in more abortions, and more unwanted children, than would otherwise result. You believe that it would be desirable to outlaw premarital sex to cause a gradual cultural shift away from all of this. And I would like you to briefly elaborate on something so that I can better understand your position. What is it about marriage that appeals to you, and why do you oppose the prevalence of divorces?

2011-08-10‎One of the major reasons why Columbine is still a (relatively) popular topic in recent years is because of the potential it allows for speculation.

Because of the snow, January and February always seem to be intolerably bright. I hate the sun so much. In any event, it's neat that Halloween is the only widely-observed holiday which sort of has the potential to be tied to despair.

2011-08-27‎YouTube has a zero-tolerance policy for Columbine videos because of Pekka Auvinen.
2011-08-28‎I don't mean it in a literal sense, and I can't elaborate because there has never been a relevant policy announcement or anything like that. Vaguely going by what I can remember, Pekka Auvinen's final video brought attention to the fan videos which were prevalent on YouTube at the time. This caused any video which might be arbitrarily construed as supporting the Columbine shooters to be removed. I don't remember there being any issues with Columbine videos prior to that, with videos like Rampart Range having many views and staying uploaded for more than a year.

2011-08-30‎I'm normally not interested in non-Kaczynski bombers, but the format and organization of everything involved was such an impressive instance of mass murder self-actualization that it seemed fictional. I wouldn't call it encouraging, but it seemed motivational enough in some sense that it was the kind of thing you would find in a particularly macabre self- improvement book. Probably owing to watching too many mass murder movies, reading excerpts like this almost had me at the edge of my seat in anticipation: ...

"Robert" was apparently an arbitrarily selected name from what I could find, though, which is especially obvious considering that it has nothing to do with him other than how he took his stepfather's AK-47. For trivia's sake, I know of four other young mass shooters whose names were Robert: Robert Smith, November 12, 1966 (Who actually did use a "six-shooter") Robert Poulin, October 27, 1975 Robert Sartin, April 30, 1989 Robert Steinhauser, April 26, 2002 In any event, that song is waaaaaaaaaayyyyyyyy too repetetive for me to listen to without throwing a hissy fit.

2011-10-24‎I had known about Targets (1968) for a while, but I expected it to only tack on a Charles Whitman-style sniper to augment a plot which would have been too lame to stand on its own. I saw it yesterday, and I was surprised to find that the sniper was the main character, with the aging actor being the tacked-on character! I don't know how I can describe it. It's like a blend of Bloody Wednesday and Stalking Laura. It isn't serious in the various ways that those two can be taken (Yes, I just called Bloody Wednesday serious in some sense), while still being sincere. It's like what Duck! should have been. I think it's the most pleasurable movie about a mass shooting that I've seen. And I can forgive the movie for including the incredibly-lame subplot because of how lightheardedly-awesome the climax of its intersection with the sniper is. If you watch it, I recommend skipping any scene which doesn't include the Charlie clone; at best, you'll only be missing some pretentious pseudo-philosophizing about aesthetics. Anyway, it made me wonder if it was the earliest portrayal of a mass/spree shooting. Before hearing about Targets, I thought that Thriller: A Cruel Picture was the earliest one (deliberately ignoring If....). As far as I know, Thriller is still the earliest movie which portrays a trench-coated shooter (with the "criminal aura", not the "detective aura"). Does anyone know of any earlier ones, for either of the two categories? Today I saw The Sniper (1952), which was released when Charles Whitman was still a wee Boy Scout, but the main character was more of a serial killer. Despite that disappointment, it was still excellent and presciently anticipated future psychological horrors. Now that I think of it, I'm sure that Charles Whitman must have snuck into a showing of The Sniper and eventually ended up imitating what he saw. After all, the sniper in the movie used a variant of an M1 carbine, which was one of the rifles that was brought up the Austin tower. What has the media done to our children?
2011-10-24‎The trailer seems to agree with my evaluation. The subplot character is thrown onto the last ten seconds as if to say, "Hey, look! We've got some famous actor for whom we'll contrive the faintest justification to include!" And upon further inspection, I think I've recovered a deleted scene from some alternative universe in Back To The Future. http://i1226.photobucket.com/albums/ee4 ... hmarty.gif And some trivia about that, the head gangster from Bloody Wednesday was the Libyan van driver! He was ultimately found not guilty for his involvement in the murder of the doctor. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S3rh6QLCHRY

2011-10-25‎The closest things I can think of are Bad Ronald and Horror High, both from 1974, although I've only seen the first. In 1976 there was a movie called God Told Me To, which I think starts with a Charlie clone sniping from a building, but I haven't seen that one either. I would be interested to hear the name of the one you're talking about if you ever find out, since I've never heard of a school shooting movie that was released in the wake of Anthony Barbaro, Michael Slobodian, and Robert Poulin.

There were several other mass murders, but even ignoring that entire aspect, the rest of the movie itself was a lot more enjoyable than I anticipated. And as a side-note, early on in the movie, it was rumored that all of the murderers had been seen with a man in his early 20s who had shoulder-length blond hair. More evidence that Martin Bryant was framed?

2011-10-28‎The average age of the people that Robert Hawkins shot was 49. That doesn't seem to be getting back at kids who have redundantly pumped-up kicks. If the song really is based off of him, they did a pretty terrible job in making it relevant when you compare it to something like I Don't Like Mondays, let alone the Omaha Shopping Mall Blues.

2011-10-29‎I can't stop thinking about how much this song annoys me. Even if it wasn't so lame, it would still bother me that they used the name "Robert".

They could have used Michael, or Evan, or Barry, which would literally fit in with the whole "cowboy kid" thing.

Instead of treating poornography as an external force which floats around trying to corrupt people from some allegedly-ideal set of behavior, why not ask where a desire for pornography comes from? Pornography exists as a coping mechanism for an artificial scarcity of sex. And where does sexual harassment come from? Sexual harassment is a retaliation against, once again, an artificial scarcity of sex. Stigmatizing sex and then being aghast that there are consequences is a classic case of having one's cake and wanting to eat it, too.

2011-11-08‎The guy who wrote Pumped Up Kicks said that the song is about an outcast teenager losing his mind while plotting revenge without any explicit violence occurring. People have interpreted that to mean that it's about a school shooting. Because of the name Robert, Robert Hawkins has now become a stereotypical poster child of school shootings. If any name other than "Robert" had been used for the song, no one would have associated Robert Hawkins with Pumped Up Kicks. If the name "Robert" had still been in the song, but Robert Hawkins had actually been 32 years old (the average age of American mass murderers in the last 20 years), again, no one would have associated him with Pumped Up Kicks. They would have instead said that "Pumped Up Kicks is surely about Robert Steinhauser", not at all because he fits in with it better than anyone else would have, but merely because his name was "Robert". At least with Robert Steinhauser, it almost sort of vaguely fits in with the interpretation many people have that the song is about school shootings. Robert Hawkins's mass murder unquestionably was not a school shooting: he shot up an upscale shopping store. Without applying my pet theory as to the origin of mass murder, which you're accusing me of doing, anyone can see that Robert Hawkins did explicitly share the socioeconomic characteristics of much older mass murderers. Instead of approaching it through simply stereotyping him as a school shooter who was bullied by his classmates, it would thus be more accurate to approach it through simply stereotyping him as maybe being a young version of Mark Barton, with whom he shared many similarities. http://www.independent.co.uk/news/i-don ... 09610.html If you interpret Pumped Up Kicks to be about school shootings and you think that Robert Hawkins is a better representation for a song about "an outcast teenager losing his mind while plotting revenge without any explicit violence" than Evan Ramsey or Michael Carneal would have been; and if you think that Pumped Up Kicks has more to do with Robert Hawkins in particular than the Omaha Shopping Mall Blues does, then I don't know what I can say. It's akin to saying that I Don't Like Mondays was about Charles Whitman. I mean, in a sense I guess it could be, but it would be absurd to say that it's a better representation of him than it is of Brenda Spencer; and if you want to think of I Don't Like Mondays being about Charles Whitman, it would be absurd to say that this song, http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlBuoBV-Sa0 has less to do with Charles Whitman than I Don't Like Mondays does.

2011-12-04‎Other than the whole "Robert" thing, the only indication that Pumped Up Kicks could be about Robert Hawkins in particular is that he used his stepfather's Kalashnikov; but that's not something unique to him because, according to the best information that I have available, around 75% of American <25-year-old mass shooters used firearms which they didn't legally own, compared to around 25% of American >24-year-old mass shooters. Instead of being an explicit reference to Robert Hawkins, it could just be a throwaway reference to a common aspect of young mass shooters. Anyway, diverging from my whining, I serendipitously rediscovered Robert C. Bonelli Jr. after having forgotten about him for a while. http://goathillstudio.com/albums/media% ... oto_13.jpg The only explicit information that I could find about him regarding his teenage years was that he had dropped out of high school at age 16. At age 24, he was an extremely shy outsider who was constantly worried about being picked on for being reportedly 260 pounds at 5'10". His duplex neighbor said that he was "the kind of kid who gets picked on in high school". His uncle said that he had an inferiority complex, always being self- conscious about the way he looked, his weight, and how no girl would ever want him. Along with being depressed for many previous years, he had been having trouble with alcohol and drug abuse. He spent almost all of his time alone in his room where he kept "a shrine of Columbine memorabilia", which included newspaper clippings, "TV documentaries about 'the darker side' of Columbine", and news accounts & pictures printed from the internet, along with a picture of Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold taped to his wall. He had a video which included him building and exploding pipe bombs with two other local dropouts, one of whom's girlfriend said that he had frequently spoken about killing himself. It's rumored that he also had multiple bootlegs of the album which contains this song: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6sZokeNzYw&t=16s If he didn't actually have it, I'm sure that he would have if he had known about it. He repeatedly took cocaine early in the morning of Sunday, February 13, 2005. Possibly precipitated by a girl rejecting his friendship several days earlier, he decided to kill himself. Dressed in black, he left a suicide note at his house, borrowed his father's car, and drove to the Hudson River with the Hesse Model 47 he had legally bought at a gun show four months earlier. He held the rifle to his head but couldn't kill himself. He drove around aimlessly, and saw a police car in the parking lot of the Hudson Valley Mall in Kingston, New York. He decided to get the police to publicly kill him. He wrote a second suicide note at some point and left it in his car. The only information I could find on either of them was from the second one, which included the Dylan quote, "The lonely man strikes with absolute rage". He had written somewhere (I don't know any details) that he had been wanting to do this before the Columbine anniversary. About an hour prior to the shooting, he went to a Walmart to buy ammunition and returned to the mall. He considered waiting until the coming Monday to do it at a school, but demonstrably decided against it. He parked in front of the Best Buy (presumably the most convenient entrance, going by Google satellite) and sat in his car for twenty minutes. Just before 3:15 PM, he picked up his rifle and walked toward the mall. He shot three times at the front door, which caused ricocheting bullet fragments and shrapnel to superficially hit his first victim. The victim's daughter's purse and pants were each penetrated once, but she remained uninjured. Once he entered the Best Buy, he spent the next seven minutes aimlessly shooting in the store. He never shot from the shoulder and most of the bullets struck the ceiling and floor. The most aiming he did involved shooting from his hip at televisions and blank walls. He had many opportunities to shoot people but bypassed all of them. He reloaded once and eventually left the Best Buy, entering the main corridor where he spent the next two minutes shooting out store displays while walking toward the center of the mall. It was here that he shot his second victim in the knee. When he had expended all of his ammunition, he dropped his rifle and calmly surrendered. He was subsequently sentenced to 32 years in prison. Robert Bonelli and Robert Hawkins (who both went by Robbie) both used AK-47 variants (although Bonelli's was a very cheap model), and both of them had two 30-round magazines (although Bonelli's weren't fancily jungle-taped together like Hawkins's). While Robert Hawkins used 2/3 of it and killed eight people and injured four, Robert Bonelli used all of it, but only directly shot one person and indirectly shot a second. The only time that I'm aware of Robert Hawkins deliberately shooting at anything other than a human was when he shot a teddy bear, but none of Robert Bonelli's shots were deliberate. Likewise, I cannot seeing anything which indicated that Robert Hawkins had been significantly affected by (the conventional interpretation of ) bullying nor peer rejection, but Robert Bonelli seems to be a different case. If any "Robert" fits in with the school shooting interpretation of the song about "an outcast teenager losing his mind while plotting revenge without any explicit violence", it's Robert Bonelli, not Robert Hawkins. The only issue is that he was 24 years old, not a teenager; but Robert Hawkins was practically the same age, being less than a half a year from 20. Anyway, "teenager" was my word, with the Pumped Up Kicks guy always saying "kid" and "youth". Robert Bonelli still doesn't fit in with it better than Evan Ramsey or Michael Carneal would. And Pumped Up Kicks is still a really lame song.

2011-12-16‎Today I dreamt a Columbine reference for the first time. I've probably never had one before because I've scarcely ever cared about Columbine. I began my dream by waking up at age 14 in my extremely dark bedroom during a power outage. I knew that there were ghoulies outside my locked door, roaming around the rest of the house. I tried to get my pocket flashlight to work, but it wasn't consistently staying on. Replacement batteries didn't help, so I instead tried using my backup flashlight: a partially-filled roll of dimes. I spent a while fumbling around with loose dimes, trying to fill up the roll, and eventually "my brother" came up to the other side of the locked door. He told me that he needed my help with the ghoulies. I was saying, "Oh, fuck off. I know you're not my brother. You yourself are one of the ghoulies", as I was continuing to fumble around trying to fill the roll of dimes. I ended up not having enough dimes to entirely fill it, but at least I had enough for it to give off a dim ray of light. I got out of bed and prepared for a fight with the ghoulies. I went downstairs as my flashlight dream- vanished, but at this point the rest of the house was dimly lit anyway. As I was about to go into the kitchen, a huge purple monster with long arms leapt forth from around a corner and pinned me against a wall. It sort of looked like this: http://www.raukusbaukus.com/images/grap ... ilcher.jpg I realized that it was some student I knew when I was 12. He tried talking to me, and basically said something to the extent of, "Everyone picked on me for being a huge purple monster, and so now I'm going to go Columbine. I already went to a bunch of other kids' houses to find a partner, but they refused my offer, so I ate them. You're next on the list. Do you want to join me?". The way it apparently worked was that I could get bitten by him and then choose which form I wanted to be in at will. I thought, why not get bitten by him so I could become a cool purple monster whenever I pleased, and then just use my new monster powers to kill him right after he bites me? So I was like, "Sure, bro". He kept trying to bite different parts of me, but it always ended in me whining, "Ooowwwwww", he would let go, look at the spot, and say, "I didn't bite long enough! It didn't work". We went through this for quite a while, and then I had the thought that, "You shouldn't just bite me -anywhere-. It should be high up on my arm so people don't see the mark, the same reason why doctors inject patients on their arm (dream logic). He rolled up my sleeve, pointed at my vein, and I said, "No! Doctors would find out because they inject there, of course! It has to be higher". He kept pointing to various places as we were walking around the house, but none of them seemed suitable to me. He gradually dream-changed into having an awfully-constructed syringe in his hand with all sorts of bent needles all over it, and I procrastinated by getting him to talk about the music he liked. I had decided at this point that I should just kill him rather than wait to get turned into a cool therianthrope because his needles were really starting to freak me out. Then I realized, "Hey, if you were feigning my brother's voice, then that means you must have killed him!" I ran down to the basement as he was assuring me he hadn't done anything, and I saw my brother soundly asleep. I went back up the stairs and saw an opportunity to kill the huge purple monster, seeing as he had transformed into a cardboard box. I shred apart the box as dawn approached while he was complaining about how confusing I was. "All the other students just screamed at me, but you accepted me, and now what are you doing? You're tearing me apart!", and I told him to shut up or something like that as I tore apart the last bit of cardboard. My brother walked up the stairs, but it wasn't really him! He had been brainwashed into believing that he was someone else from my childhood, whom I'll call Billy, and he had even been made up to look sort of like him. I asked him who he thought he was, and sure enough he said Billy, and that he was moving away to college. I followed him into the garage, trying to find a way to convince him that he wasn't Billy before it was too late. Once I entered the garage, my nonexistent kindergarten-age sister was blocking my path while crying for some reason. I affectionately embraced her in my arms and tenderly kissed her. She woefully said, "I don't want you to kiss me" as her crying got worse. I was annoyed that she had been brainwashed into thinking there was something evil about kissing, so I picked her up and tossed her over the railing into a pile of cardboard boxes several feet below. Heroically getting back to the task at hand, I looked out at the open garage door, where there were all sorts of non-existent relatives assembling outside in the full-blown morning. There was some fictional high-status male family member at the garage door reading from a scroll in his hands. He was giving the eulogy for my "dead" brother! There were some assorted people in the garage who were walking toward the outside, and I saw that among them were two pastors. My horror movie experience indicated that pastors help with all sorts of ghoulie problems, so I called them over and explained that my brother wasn't actually dead. They were shocked and agreed to help stop the ceremony. One of them followed me toward the eulogizer, but at this point, the garage was significantly larger and was extremely crowded, to the extent where I couldn't even pass anyone. Everyone stopped walking as they turned to look behind us at someone who was walking forward. It was apparently her birthday, so the only logical thing to do was hum the wedding march. The pastor and I sighed as we hummed with them, waiting for them to move forward again. The song ended, she stopped, and said, "I'm glad that you're all here today". Various views of multiple explosions went through my mind, and at the end of it, a third- person overhead stationary view showed some WASPs in a residential park doing all sorts of recreational activities. Text appeared saying, "At least now there was plenty of space for racquetball". I realized that I had been watching a YouTube video, part 11/11. I thought, "Wow, that was a pretty surreal movie. I'm bookmarking this and I'll go back to look at the other parts later". I woke up in real life and realized that YouTube would remove the videos from their website along with all internet references to them by the time that I managed to get online, so I typed this for posterity.

2011-12-23‎The difference is that Anders Breivik is a political reationary whose propaganda of the deed just happened to involve mass murder. I think he has more to do with political assassins who attacked single targets than he has to do with 99% of mass shooters; even ones like Baruch Goldstein.

2011-12-25‎"I hate going through these extremely rare instances of wild mood swings that I have. I think this was the only time this year for me. I was as depressed as I get during my last post, and I'm fine with the interminable depression that I normally have, but now I'm incoherently giddy with glee. Well, relative to my baseline... Except now that I'm giddy, I can't really say that I hate it because I think everything is delightful. If depressives cut themselves to feel better, I wonder what cutting a happy-go-lucker would do. Santa's supposed to be jolly. I hope he visits me tonight so I can find out."

2011-12-29‎What is "chemical imbalance" even supposed to mean? Why don't hunter-gatherers need antidepressants? I swear, a psychiatrist could take a perfectly fine chimpanzee away from its jungle, confine it in captivity, and when the chimp gets depressed, they would say, "This chimpanzee has a chemical imbalance. What? A correlation between enculturation and depression? But culture brings us meaning and beauty. Get out of my way, caveman- wannabe. I need to prescribe this chimp some Xanax".
2011-12-29‎I entirely recognize that value is a delusion. I'm not condemning them: I genuinely want to understand why they love technology. I can't at all relate to why they desire even more civilization than the amount that's already been imposed onto them.
2011-12-29‎Only if you factor in infant mortality, but that's even more of an indication why they should be needing antidepressants, not the opposite. And yet somehow, it's we domesticated humans that need antidepressants while hunter-gatherers are the happy ones.

2012-02-24‎"Oh, dear God. The school shooter in the episode of Homicide: Life on the Streets was the host of the children's show Blues Clues. I guess going away to school didn't turn out too well for him. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlwxXObnR-g&t=0m05s This tragedy could have been prevented. Steve showed all of the warning signs. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N1wUirNlR0U Anyway, since Megaupload is gone, here's Mad_Bomber's list: https://rapidshare.com/files/3734858298/tv_updated.rtf I've now seen all of the fiction mentioned in these topics except for the following. PM me if you know of a free non-torrent source for any of these in English audio or with English subtitles: Death Scenes 2 (1992) La classe de neige (1998) (I found something under this title that was also about a ski trip, but it was a gay porno. Maybe I just don't understand French cinema, but it seemed like a rather liberal interpretation of ""shooting"". ?:( ) Detention: The Siege at Johnson High (1997) Heart of America (2002) Prelude (2003) American Yearbook (2004) Purgatory House (2004) The Division - Zero Tolerance - S04E21 (2004) Empire Falls (2005) Why (2006) Ekskul (2006) The Janitor's Office (2007) Himo kiusata (2009) Little Angels (?) And here are some others which haven't been mentioned: Massacre at Central High (1976) http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0074875/ The more allegorical precursor to Heathers. Degrassi High - Show Time: Part 1 - S02E10 Proto-emo. Law & Order - Deadlock - S17E09 Eduardo Sencion meets Hank Carr meets Maksim Gelman meets Karel Charva (meets Jack Ruby?) in this orgasm of mass murder. Well, at least by generic-investigative-drama standards. Law & Order- Rubber Room - S20E23 Over-the-top Columbine references, although they forgot to include the one about police negligence. Gilmore Girls - Like Mother, Like Daughter - S02E07 Several references in the beginning to trench-coated loners with duffel bags. The Inbetweeners - The Fashion Show - S03E01 A throwaway joke, http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_bgKZZ1LQY&t=1m51s There's also a pudgy balding British pederast named Tom who has the surname of a prominent American politician and goes around undressing boys. A reference to Tom Hamilton? http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AkI6Tgultxk&t=10m48s http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AkI6Tgultxk&t=13m51s http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_bgKZZ1LQY&t=8m01s And three docudramas: Hostage: Do or Die - Negotiating with a Mad Man - S01E02 Hank Carr, although I don't really consider him a mass murderer. Hostage: Do or Die - Palm Bay Rampage - S01E03 William Cruse; fairly retro. Hostage: Do or Die - Lindhurst High School - S01E05 Eric Houston; a surrogate for the unattainable Detention: The Siege at Johnson High? And a movie based on David Gray, which I didn't think was particularly enjoyable, but still way better than what I remember of Polytechnique: Out of the Blue (2006) http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0839938/ And although Horror High (1974) doesn't involve a school shooting, it's the earliest depiction of a high-school-outcast-turned-murderer that I know of, released half a year before Bad Ronald (1974) (and was filmed in the same year as the book was published); and while Bad Ronald is more on the serial killer side, Horror High deals more with the school shooter archetype, indicated in lines as explicit as, ""All my life, I've been bothered and pushed around by the 'Rogers'... Well, not anymore! Now they're afraid of me!"".

2012-02-24‎I was recently thinking about how hostage situations so very often involve demands for a getaway. Is there a single modern instance when non-state hostage takers have successfully gotten a non-sabotaged automobile/helicopter/whatever from negotiators?
2012-02-26‎"I hate how life-apologists say (or rather, the very few of them who do anything other than mock you), ""Life isn't all suffering. What about the simple pleasures, like eating ice cream?"" They always use that example. Even if I didn't recognize the flaws in their assertion, when I think of ice cream, I can only see a repugnant lump of pus crushed out of cows' bloody nipples, who spend their entire lives confined in filth, where they're periodically raped so that they're incessantly pregnant, after which their calves are seized from them, destined to live the life of veal, with their only relief being an early death. From there, I always ride the pessimism train down different tracks until it inevitably leads me to contemplating over 500 million years of animals cannibalizing each other. Excuse me for not being thrilled by the extra jimmies on my ice cream cone."
2012-02-28‎"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=De-tIflr4E0&t=7m50s There have been many that aren't on that list, although I'm not very familiar with them. I think I remember this having a lot listed: http://signofthetimes.yuku.com/topic/1291 There were two teenagers who were arrested after one of them left their journal in a McDonald's, as memorialized by Sabratha's Bullet Time. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlgDhcbJRoY&t=5m55s One of them was caught a second time a couple years later with another student."
2012-02-28‎"I could go in a hundred different ways with this, but I'll try to make it as entirely relevant to AS55's post as I can, instead of rambling about chimpanzees and who-knows-what-else. Columbine wasn't an isolated incident: it was the apex of a string of school shootings which began increasing with Lu Gang and Wayne Lo in the early 1990s. Despite American students committing fewer school shootings in 2000-2009 than they did in 1990-1999, the rate of attempts actually increased beyond their pre-Columbine level. Columbine caused Americans to begin taking the potential for school shootings seriously, and thus many attempts which were expected to have been carried out have instead been prevented. And since 1999, there has been an increase in foreign school massacres committed in countries where, as Sabratha's Bullet Time phrases it, there isn't the ""operational history"" of Columbine. In any event, it's myopic to telescope on school shootings when they've comprised a small percentage of the larger trend of mass murders, which are carried out in all sorts of contexts; but they always occur in contexts which involve some permutation of alienation, which has been part and parcel with societal ""progress"". This relationship can be seen with the Chinese mass stabbings. There were some sparse incidents throughout the 20th century, but the rate began to rise in the 1990s and erupted in the early 2000s, corresponding to China's rapid ""economic development"", culminating in the infamous spate of elementary school stabbings of 2010. American mass murders were less prevalent before Richard Speck precipitated their rise in 1966. My best estimate for the -absolute- minimum amount of mass murders in the US since 1966 is 960. I would be surprised if there weren't a minimum of somewhere around 1500 in reality, but we'll just vaguely say that there have been over 1000. If you were trying to measure alienation in a society, what could be a more blatant indication? And it's glib to dismiss them as not being indicative of anything just because there have been over a thousand of them instead of over a hundred thousand, or however many you think are necessary, because mass murdering is so ridiculously over-the-top of a response that very few people are prone to do it under any circumstances. But just look at how many fans you can find for all different types of mass murderersâ€"not just the Reb & VoDkA bunch", and beyond these fans are countless more people who can sympathize with them; and beyond these are millions more who never think of relating the circumstances of their lives to anyone else but instead just go through the motions of life incessantly dissatisfied with their environment. Thinking of this society as the default state of existence is the reason why you think that humans would be ""not well"" for ""no reason whatsoever"". Civilization has not been present for 99% of the existence of hominids, and the only way that it's ever sustained is by indoctrinating each new child for years on end. The ""wellness"" that you speak of is solely defined by a child's submission to this process and their subsequent capacity to propagate civilization themselves. When civilization exists in a form where all forms of alienation (among many other things) are rampant, as can be seen in the most recent incarnation within the last fifty years which AS55 talked about, new children will end up ""not well"" in all sorts of ways. You don't even have to touch a topic as cryptic as mass murder to see an indication of this: you can look at a single symptom as egregious as the proliferation of antidepressants. And look in your own life. You've said that you're afflicted by unrelenting anxiety and that you're afraid to leave your house. Do you really think that the way you feel is not symptomatic of anything other than your own inexplicable defectiveness? http://www.spunk.org/texts/writers/zerzan/sp001182.txt http://www.spunk.org/texts/writers/zerzan/sp001183.txt"
