2005-12-03‎Winter - Winter approaches from all  sides. It's snowed twice this year, but it's only December. I love the  snow and ice. So cold. Ice especially, when it's freezing rain. That's  so cool. All the streets, roofs of houses, cars, and everything, is  covered in a thin sheet of ice. It's beautiful like a winter-wonderland.  Mood: Dark Music: Goth
2005-12-23‎Vengeance is coming - It will be a  quiet and peacefull morning. A light drizzle will be starting up. The  clouds will be grey, so grey. Just the way I like it. Disembowled  bodies litter the streets. Some have been decapitated, others hung off  bridges and over-passes. Yet, others still lie burning. Flames slowly  eatting away at their putrid flesh. Glorious. HA HA HA HA HA HA HA  They have paid this day, they truly have paid. HA HA HA HA HA HA  HA  Mood: Dark Music: Metal

The other day on T.V. they were talking about this 15 year old kid that  was killed by the cops, cuz' he took a fake gun to school. Then they  said he was emotionally disturbed and suicidal. Aaaaa, Duh!! If  people were making your life a living hell wouldn't you be hurt  emotionally.  How come no one ever talkes about those MOTHER FUCKING  JOCKS AND PREPS who's fault it is. Oh no. Heaven forbid. We  couldn't posibly say that. Why does society applaude jocks? I don't  understand. They are the worse kind of people on earth. And the  preps are no better, they think they're better than others............but  they're not.  And all of society applaudes the jocks and preps. As if we are all  supposed to be like them.

Saying that word makes me want to sleep, but I can't.  I wonder what happened to Barbara Borelli from High School? Not  that I ever really knew her much. But when you're in High School, you  don't really realize, that after graduation, you're never ever going to  see most of those people ever again. If I'd a known that, I would'a at  least told her I liked her. Maybe hung out with her a bit after school,  would'a been fun. Meh, she probably didn't like me anyway. She was  always full of energy, running here and there. LOL. I wonder if she's  still like that. Guess I'll never know.  Mood: Wide Awake Music: Marilyn Manson

HA HA HA HA HA HA HA  MUHAHAHAHA  Mood: Same as 5 minutes ago...........lol Music: Cradle of Filth -  Hallowed By Thy Name--------  One of Bonnie Parker's Poems - March 18, 2006, 03:12:am  THE TRAIL'S END  You've read the story of Jesse James of how he lived and died. If  you're still in need; of something to read, here's the story of Bonnie  and Clyde.  Now Bonnie and Clyde are the Barrow gang I'm sure you all have  read. how they rob and steal; and those who squeal, are usually  found dying or dead.  There's lots of untruths to these write-ups; they're not as ruthless as  that. their nature is raw; they hate all the law, the stool pidgeons,  spotters and rats.  They call them cold-blooded killers they say they are heartless and  mean. But I say this with pride that I once knew Clyde, when he was  honest and upright and clean.  But the law fooled around; kept taking him down, and locking him up  in a cell. Till he said to me; "I'll never be free, so I'll meet a few of  them in hell"  The road was so dimly lighted there were no highway signs to  guide. But they made up their minds; if all roads were blind, they  wouldn't give up till they died.  The road gets dimmer and dimmer sometimes you can hardly  see. But it's fight man to man and do all you can, for they know theycan never be free.  From heart-break some people have suffered from weariness some  people have died. But take it all in all; our troubles are small, till we  get like Bonnie and Clyde.  If a policeman is killed in Dallas and they have no clue or guide. If  they can't find a fiend, they just wipe their slate clean and hang it on  Bonnie and Clyde.  There's two crimes committed in America not accredited to the  Barrow mob. They had no hand; in the kidnap demand, nor the  Kansas City Depot job.  A newsboy once said to his buddy; "I wish old Clyde would get  jumped. In these awfull hard times; we'd make a few dimes, if five or  six cops would get bumped"  The police haven't got the report yet but Clyde called me up  today. He said,"Don't start any fights; we aren't working nights, we're  joining the NRA."  From Irving to West Dallas viaduct is known as the Great  Divide. Where the women are kin; and the men are men, and they  won't "stool" on Bonnie and Clyde.  If they try to act like citizens and rent them a nice little flat. About the  third night; they're invited to fight, by a sub-gun's rat-tat-tat.  They don't think they're too smart or desperate they know that the law  always wins. They've been shot at before; but they do not ignore, that  death is the wages of sin.Some day they'll go down together they'll bury them side by side. To  few it'll be grief, to the law a relief but it's death for Bonnie and Clyde.  Mood: Emptyness Music: Tiamat - Whatever That Hurts

I'm still working on it, after it's  all written up, it'll probably be like 200 pages long. Then I'll have to do  major editting, like, take entire scenes out and stuff.  But it's fun. I just don't know how to go about getting someone, like a  movie director or producer to look at it. Cuz' I've never been in this  field of work before. But I don't need to worry about that just yet, cuz' I  don't even know how it's gonna end. Like, I kinda know the final  conclusion. But there's tons of extra stuff I can add or delete from the  last 20 minutes of the movie.  Like in the movie "SAW 2". The last 10 minutes or so, makes the  movie great. And just like that, there's tons of movies where the last  bits are spectacular, and only then is the movie a success.  Mood: No mood......Working on script Music: No music......Working on  script

2006-07-13‎Raining blood - There was a  thundering boom and the sky ripped open All went silent No birds  chirping, no dogs barking, no children running around playing, Not a  sound. No cars, no honking horns, no machines. Not a sound  A little blonde haired girl is walking home from school  Then a soft drizzle (no wind) Tap tap tap it said, as the raindrops hit  the pavement Tap tap tap it said, as it hit the roof tops Tap tap tap it  said, as it hit the cars, trucks, and buses Tap tap tap it said. Again  and again and again.  The little girl looks up at the sky, giggles slightly to herself, and starts  to walk faster  The rain quickens it's pace (a strong breeze) Shhhhhhhhhh it said, as  it splashed against the windows Shhhhhhhhhh it said, as it flooded  the streets Shhhhhhhhhh it said, as it drowned the rodents and  insects  Shhhhhhhhhh it said. Just....ShhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhThe little cutie smiles to herself as she starts running. Her greenish- blue eyes glimmer with excitment.  The moderate rain turns to all out thundershowers, a likes of which  has never been seen on this wretched earth. From the skies comes a  laughter, a laugh like no other.  The little girl runs home and opens the front door. She holds the wall  for support as she takes of her shoes. She's so happy.  She runs up  the stairs into her mothers arms A blood curling scream is heard.  Mood: Vengeance Music: Ozzy Osborne - Psycho Man
2006-07-13‎Death Knight - It rained for three  days The sky is grey.....so grey A deep cut slowly makes it's way  through the palid clouds, and a figure emerges.  Drapped in black cloth. Head to toe, all black Boots as black as  tar Cloak lashing to and fro with the wind The hood covers his face  entirely  The skeletal horse he rides neighs with ferosity as the reigns  are pulled to the side to steer the mighty beast to the left.  His two- handed sword on his back, axe on his left side, sword on the right. A  modified shotgun on a leather sling hangs downwards  The mysterious figure rides down to the earth on what would appear  to be an invisible mountain. As his steads hoofs touch the wet grass,  it lets out an angry growl, almost as though it yearns to be elsewhere.  The disgusting human creatures scream in panic and run in all  directons, taking with them their lies and deceptions. The Death  Knight gazes at the humans with an empty stare, as they knock eachother down in a mad dash to safety. He wishes to slaughter them as  they flee, but sensing that his war horse is hungry and quite weary of  the long journey, he decides to rest.  It starts to rain slightly, as he heads into the nearby forest for  sanctuary. The human noise dimming in his ears as they move  deeper into wilderness.

2006-08-24‎Raining - It rained a couple days ago, iwent for a walk in the rain, it wasn't raining much when i went, i really  went to get a beer at the Dep, but it was so dark outside, and raining.  I just couldn't rush back home.  I just wish the rain didn't pick up, otherwise it would'a been perfect. I  see people running from the rain, it makes me laugh. You know, how  people quickly rush from their car, or home, or shopping mall, so they  don't get wet. I don't get it!  Or with their umbrellas (I don't use  Umbrellas)  My trenchcoat flew behind me a couple of times when the wind  picked up, other than that not very windy. Just the way I like it. And it  was deserted, every street, it looked like everyone had died. Cuz'  there wasn't a person anywhere. Another reason i liked it. lol. Well,  not no one on one. I did see some people, but like 95% less  population than regular.  Ever notice that when the clouds turn grey the humans become  sparse, like, even before the rain, even if there is no rain. I'll never  understand humans. The way they live their lives, their feelings, the  things they want to do in life, probably has something to do with these  invisible gods they pray to. Meh.

2006-08-28‎Hip Hop isn't music it's inferior - Hip  hop isn't music, it's just animals jumping up and down, like monkeys.  Why don't the men respect the women, why are the men always  calling the women "bitches" and "hos"?, but more importantly, why do  these women like to be talked to like this, and treated like this?  Someone actually told me Snoop Doggy Dog is a poet. Can you  believe that. A poet? You see...you see...people actually believe this.  Animals...just animals. Have you seen some of their videos that play  24/7 on all the music channels worldwide? It's all image. all the girls  are acting like whores, sorry, let me rephrase that...all the girls are  whores. I can't understand what has happened to this world.  They keep refering to each other as niggers or niggahs, they're all  black, yet they keep saying the "N" word to each other? Does this  mean that they understand that they are in fact inferior niggahs? They  should stop, and be more gentlemanly and civilized. In one video  some rapped is trying to have sex with a car, while eatting fried  chicken. WTF!!!  Things weren't like this before. People had respect for each other,  they had manners, and a sense of decency.  Stop degrading yourselves, i'm trying to help you  RESPECT WOMEN YOU FUCKING ANIMALS  Mood: ........................................ Music: Sentenced - My SlowingHeart
2006-08-28‎What's with.....? - What's with all the  slow lines everywhere? At the dep, at the mall, at the S.A.A.Q., even  though we need more people at the cash registers, they keep  replacing people with machines....machines that suck, and  malfunction.  What's with the construction workers? Why do they get paid so much,  to work so slow? The places i've worked, we have to work super fast  for so little money. Am i in some sort of Bizzaro world, like i'm the  only one in it.  What's with all the bitches? It's almost as though there was some sort  of bitch convention somewhere, and 85% of the women went and all  agreed to be bitches forever. The other 15% were spared. But having  all these bitches in one room gave them a great power. A power not  yet seen in this world. It's a special attack move of theirs. It  transforms them into super bitches. It's so powerful, that they can  only remain in that state for a short period of time, then they go back  to being ordinary bitches.  What's with all the assholes? It's like they invited all the men to a  huge arena, where all the sports were playing, Soccer, baseball,  basketball(for our negro friends), hockey, and others. 85% of the men  showed up. And they must have all made a pact to be assholes, and  fucktards for the rest of their lives. The other 15% who didn't show up  were spared. These creatures were also given a super power of thir  own. They are able to transform into motherfuckers, backstabbers,two-faced liars for short times, thus, just like the women, it's a  powerful ability, so won't last for too long, as it wears of, they turn  back into the ordinary assholes that they were.  What's with people? The governments of the world use scare tactics  to fear the populations of the world into submission, and people  submit. Pathetic little monkeys. Run little monkeys, go kill each other  for your gods that don't even exist, go little monkeys, die for money,  money that goes directly into the pockets of world leaders. Run  monkeys, quickly, no no, don't ever ask questions like "Why", "How",  "That doesn't make any sense", "That's completly illogical". Do as we  say little human creatures.

2006-09-04‎Where's Waldo? I think not! Where's Barbara is the true question!! - Where's Waldo? I think not! Where's Barbara is the true  question!! - September 04, 2006, 03:57:am   I was thinking of  Barbara Borelli yesterday.  I saw her in a dream. She was just standing their smiling at me. She  looked like a princess. All in white clothes, and she was just smiling,  the most beautiful smile, but didn't say anything, and i just looked at  her, i tryed to look at her ears to see how many piercings she had by  now, but couldn't see anything other than her face. There was a  bright white light shining from all over, around her body, from the  ground up, from the sky down, all over, a super bright white light. I  couldn't stop looking in her eyes, it almost felt like if i stopped gazing  into her eyes, that i would die. For a second i thought she was trying  to tell me something, I wanted to run up to her and hold her, and  touch her, to see if she was real, cuz' this dream felt different than  others i've had. But i couldn't move. I wanted to look down to see if  there was something holding my feet and keeping me from moving,  but i couldn't take my eyes off her.  It was weird. Cuz' usually I have dreams about people beingmurdered, hung, getting shot in the head, and stuff like that.  Sometimes it's me that that stuff is happening to, and it's always dark  and cold. But this was so different.  I wonder what happened to her? She was a girl that went to my high  school. We hardly ever spoke, we were in like two different groups of  friends, so our paths rarely crossed. She always looks so  preoccupied with stuff. I liked her, guess I should have told her or  something, just to let her know and stuff, not that anything would  have happened, but it would'a been nice.  I wonder what she's up to? Maybe she owns her own business or  something (seemed like something she'd like). It always made me  smile when she went running down the halls, screaming at the top of  her lungs, arms and legs flailing in every direction. Like some sort of  escaped mental patient or something (I mean that in a good way).  She was really sweet. (But loud) Bet if she ever stumbled upon my  web page, she'd hunt me down and smack me for that. lol.  Wonder if she'd have let me call her Bar-bar if we had been friends.  Bar-bar sounds nice to me. Hey! Hey Bar-bar!! Where are you?  You're not under my bed, or in my basement, or dancing on the roof!!  :(  Have fun Barb :)  Mood: I have no mood, i Music: Soundgarden - Fell on Black Days

Postal 2 Share the Pain  was o.k. but too childish, i want them to make a game so realistic,  that it looks and feels like it's actually happening. Perhaps when they  come out with Postal 4 (If they ever do)  Not just the graphics, but there should be more to do, other than just  shooting people for no reason, there needs to be a plot, and a good  story line. But i doubt Vince Desi cares what i have to say :(  And there should be music, a good soundtrack, with tunes from  Marilyn Manson, Rammstein, Disturbed, and many others, you know  what kinda' bands we like. Mmmmmm, what else, what else? Make it  longer, ummmmmm, you know the kind'a things i want, and also  make a small additional game, just like the first postal game, but with  graphics of today (that'll just be a little fun thingy on the side) All  concentration showld be on the main game, guess it'll have to be for  Postal 4 cuz' the 3rd ones already being made.  Hope no one kills the makers of the Postal game, cuz' those guys  rock. If someone does attack "Running With Scissors" or any of you  guys, it'll be those religious fanatics, like those guys that kill abortion  doctors and stuff, so watch out!!  I also heard that the Postal movie was gonna suck, not that i know  anything, but it's better to postpone production and make it really,  really, really, good. Instead of rushing it. It shoul'd be a blockbuster  movie, that everyone on earth wants to watch, or will want to watch  after they here about it from their friends.  You gotta bring Postal into the mainstream. I want more people tosee what I see. By changing the format of the game and movie, you  can do it. Just a little, the basis of Postal dude should stay the same,  just gotta be a better story line. Lets get to know Postal dude's  girlfriend, the places he worked at, the people that pissed him off, all  that stuff, in detail, like a real kick ass game/movie  (Postal dude was sad before he became angry and psychotic, that's  the part we're never seen in the game. He was normal, but the world  made him the way he became, gotta show that in the game and  movie too)  Meh, that's it i guess  :(  Mood: :( Music: Marilyn Manson - In the Shadow of the Valley of  Death
