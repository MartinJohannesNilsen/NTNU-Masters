1998-04-10‎I hate the fucking world, too much god damn fuckers in it. Too many thoughts and different societies all wrapped up together in this fucking place called AMERICA. Everyone has their own god damn opinions on every god damn thing and you may be saying “well what makes you so different?” because I have something only me and V have, SELF AWARENESS. Call it existentialism or whatever the fuck you want. We know what we are to this world and what everyone else is. We learn more than what caused the civil war and how to simplify quadratics in school. We have been watching you people. We know what you think and how you act. All talk and no actions. People who are said to be brave or courageous are usually just STUPID. Then they say later that they did it on purpose cause they are brave when they did on fucking accident. GOD everything is so corrupt and so filled with opinions and points of view and people’s own little agendas and schedules. This isn’t a world anymore. It’s HOE and no one knows it. Self awareness is a wonderful thing. I know I will die soon, so will you and everyone else. Maybe we will be lucky and a comet will smash us back to day 1. people say it is immoral to follow others, they say be a leader. Well here is a fuckin news flash for you stupid shits, everyone is a follower! Everyone who says they aren’t followers and then dresses different or acts different . . . they got that from something they saw on TV or in film or in life. No originality. How many Jo MAMMA jokes are there and how many do you think are original and not copied. KEINE. It’s a fucking filthy place we live in. All these standards and laws and great expectations are making people into robots even though they might “think” they aren’t and try to deny it. No matter how hard I try to NOT copy someone I still AM! Except for this fucking piece of paper right here, and BTW spelling is stupid unless I say, I say spell it how it sounds, it’s the fuckin easiest way! Hey try this sometime, when someone tells you something, ask “why?” eventually they will be stumped and can’t answer any more. That’s because they only know what they need to know in society and school. Not real life science. They will end up saying words = to this “because! Just shut up!” People that only know stupid facts that aren’t important should be shot, what fucking use are they. NATURAL SELECTION. Kill all retards, people with brain fuck ups, drug addicts, people who can’t figure out how to use a fucking lighter. Geeeawd! People spend millions of dollars on saving the lives of retards, and why. I don’t buy that shit like “oh, he’s my son, though!” so the fuck what, he ain’t normal, kill him. Put him out of his misery. He is only a waste of time and money, then people say “but he is worth the time, he is human too.” No he isn’t, if he was then he would swallow a bullet cause he would realize what a fucking he was.
1998-04-12‎As I said before, self-awareness is a wonderful thing. I know what all you fuckers are thinking and what to do to piss you off and make you feel bad. I always try to be different, but I always end up copying someone else. I try to be a mixture of different things and styles, but when I step out of myself I end up looking like others or others THINK I am copying. One big fucking problem is people telling me what to fuckin do, think, say, act, and everything else. I’ll do what you say IF I feel like it. But people (ie, parents, cops, God, teachers) telling me what to “do, think, say, act” makes me not want to fucking do it! That’s why my fucking name is REB!!! No one is worthy of shit unless I say they are. I feel like God and I wish I was, having everyone being OFFICIALLY lower than me. I already know that I am higher than most anyone in the fucking welt in terms of universal Intelligence. And where we stand in the universe compared to the rest of the UNIVERSE. and if you think I don’t know what I’m talking about then you can just “BUCK DICH” and saugen mein hund! Isn’t America supposed to be the land of the free? How come, If I’m free, I can’t deprive a stupid fucking dumbshit from his possessions if he leaves them sitting in the front seat of his fucking van out in plain sight and in the middle of fucking nowhere on a Frifuckingday night. NATURAL SELECTION. Fucker should be shot. Same thing with all those rich snotty toadies at my school. Fuckers think they are higher than me and everyone else with all their $ just because they were born into it? Ich denk NEIN. BTW, “sorry” is just a word. It doesn’t mean SHIT to me. Everyone should be put to a test, an ULTIMATE DOOM test, see who can survive in an environment using only ‘smarts’ and military skills. Put them in a Doom world, no authority, no refuge, no BS copout excuses. If you can’t figure out the area of a triangle or what “cation” means, you die! If you can’t take down a demon with a chainsaw or kill a hell prince with a shotgun, you die! Fucking snotty rich fuckheads who rely on others or on sympathy or $ to get them through life should be put to this challenge. Plus it would get rid of all the fat, retarded, crippled, stupid, dumb, ignorant, worthless people of this world. No one is worthy of this planet, only me and who ever I choose, there is just no respect for anything higher than your fucking boss or parent. Everyone should be shot out into space and only those people I say should be left behind.
1998-04-21‎Ever wonder why we go to school? Besides getting a so-called education. It’s not too obvious to most of you stupid fucks but for those who think a little more and deeper you should realize it. Its society’s way of turning all the young people into good little robots and factory workers. That’s why we sit in desks in rows and go by bell schedules, to get prepared for the real world cause “that’s what its like.” Well god damn it no it isn’t! one thing that separates us from other animals is the fact that we can carry actual thoughts. So why don’t we? People go on day by day routine shit. Why can’t we learn in school how we want to, why can’t we sit on desks and on shelves and put our feet up and relax while we learn? Cause that’s not what the “real world is like.” Well hey fuckheads, there is no such thing as an actual “real world.” Its just another word like justice, sorry, pity, religion, faith, luck and so on. We are humans, if we don’t like something we have the fucking ability to change! But we don’t, at least you don’t, I would. You just whine/bitch throughout life but never do a goddamn thing to change anything. “man can eat, drink, fuck, and hunt and anything else he does is madness” — Based on Lem’s quote. Boy oh fuckin boy is that true. When I go NBK and people say things like, “oh, it was so tragic,” or “oh he is crazy!” or “It was so bloody.” I think, so the fuck what you think that’s a bad thing? Just because your mumsy and dadsy told you blood and violence is bad, you think it’s a fucking law of nature? Wrong. Only science and math are true, everything, and I mean everyfuckingthing else is Man made. My doctor wants to put me on medication to stop thinking about so many things and to stop getting angry. Well, I think that anyone who doesn’t think like me is just bullshitting themselves. Try it sometime if you think you are worthy, which you probably will you little shits, drop all your beliefs and views and ideas that have been burned into your head and try to think about why your here. But I bet most of you fuckers can’t even think that deep, so that is why you must die. How dare you think that I and you are part of the same species when we are sooooooo different. You aren’t human. You are a robot. You don’t take advantage of your capabilities given to you at birth. You just drop them and hop onto the boat and head down the stream of life with all the other fuckers of your time. Well god damn it I won’t be part of it! I have thought too much, realized too much, found out too much, and I am too self aware to just stop what I am thinking and go back to society because what I do and think isn’t “right” or “morally accepted.” NO, NO, NO. God fucking damn it NO! I will sooner die than betray my own thoughts. But before I leave this worthless place, I will kill who ever I deem unfit for anything at all. Especially life. And if you pissed me off in the past, you will die if I see you. Because you might be able to piss off others and have it eventually blow over, but not me. I don’t forget people who wronged me, like . He will never get a chance to read this because he will be dead by me before this is discovered. 
1998-05-06‎The human race sucks. Human nature is smothered out by society, job, and work and school. Instincts are deleted by laws. I see people say things that contradict themselves, or people that don’t take any advantage to the gift of human life. They waste their minds on memorizing the stats of every college basketball player or how many words should be in a report when they should be using their brain on more important things. The human race isn’t worth fighting for anymore. WWII was the last war worth fighting and was the last time human life and human brains did any good and made us proud. Now, with the government having scandals and conspiracies all over the fucking place and lying to everyone all the time and with worthless, pointless, mindless, disgraceful TV shows on and with everyone ob-fucking-sessed with Hollywood and beauty and fame and glamour and politics and anything famous, people just aren’t worth saving. Society may not realize what is happening but I have; you go to school, to get used to studying and learning how your “supposed to” so that drains or filters out a little bit of human nature. But that’s after your parents taught you what’s right and wrong even though you may think differently, you still must follow the rules. After school you are expected to get a job or go to college. To have more of your human nature blown out your ass. Society tries to make everyone act the same by burying all human nature and instincts. That’s what schools, laws, jobs, and parents do. If they realize it or not. And them, the few who stick to their natural instincts are casted out as psychos or lunatics or strangers or just plain different. crazy, strange, weird, wild, these words are not bad or degrading. If humans were let to live how we would naturally, it would be chaos and anarchy and the human race wouldn’t probably last that long, but hey guess what, that’s how it’s supposed to be!!!!! Societies and government are only created to have order and calmness, which is exactly the opposite of pure human nature. Take away all your laws and morals and just see what you can do if the governments in our own little so called self-created “civilized world” and get rid of all those damn instincts everyone has!! Bullshit. I’m too tired to write anymore tonight, so until next time, fuck you all.
1998-05-09‎It has been confirmed, after getting my yearbook and watching people like and the human race isn’t worth fighting for, only worth killing. Give the Earth back to the animals, they deserve it infinitely more than we do. Nothing means anything anymore, most quotes are worthless, especially the rearranged ones like “don’t fight your enemies, make your enemies fight.” You know, quotes that use the same phrase just rearranged, Dumb fuck shit it’s funny, people say “you shouldn’t be so different” to me, and 1st I say fuck you don’t tell me what I should and shouldn’t be and 2nd mother fuckers different is good, I don’t want to be like you or anyone which is almost impossible this day with all the little shits trying to be “original copycats”, I expect shits like you to criticize anyone who isn’t one your social words, “normal” or “civilized” — see: Tempest and Caliban. All you degrading worthless shits all caught up and brainwashed into the 90’s society. “what? You AREN’T going to college, are you crazy!” holy SHIT that is one fucking BIG quote that just proves my point. Step back and look at yourself fuckers, I dare you, maybe I’ll get lucky and you’ll step back to far like Nick in E1M3 with the same consequence.
1998-05-20‎Wooh, different pen. HA! All right you pathetic fools listen up; I have figured it out. The hu- man race strives for excellence in life and community always wanting to bring more =good= into the community. And nullify “bad” things. Anyone who thinks differently than the majority or the leaders is deemed “unusual” or weird or crazy. People want to be a part of something, a family, a service, a club, a union, a community, whatever. That’s what humans want. Who cares what you as an individual thinks, you must do what you are told, whether it is jump off a bridge or drive on the right side of the road. Protesters in the past protested because the human race that was dominant (Ghandhi and the Brits or the king or the Americans) wasn’t working out = they had fault = they failed = their ideas didn’t work. Humans don’t change that much, they only get better technology to do their work quicker/easier. People always say we shouldn’t be racist. Why not? Blacks ARE different. Like it or not they are. They started out on the bottom so why not keep em there. It took them centuries to convince us that they are equal but they still use their color as an excuse or they just discriminate us because we are white. Fuck you, we should ship yer black asses back to Afrifuckingca were you came from. We brought you here and we will take you back. America = white. Gays. . . . well all gays, ALL gays, should be killed. Mit keine fragen. Lesbians are fun to watch if they are hot but still, its not human. It’s a fucking disease. You don’t see bulls or roosters trying to fuck, do you? No, I didn’t think so. Women, you will always be under men. It’s been seen throughout nature, males are almost always doing the dangerous shit while the women stay back. It’s your animal instincts, deal with it or commit suicide, just do it quick. That’s all for now.
1998-06-12‎If you recall your history the Nazis came up with a “final solution” to the Jewish problem. Kill them all. Well, in case you haven’t figured it out yet, I say “KILL MANKIND” no one should survive. We all live in lies. People are always saying they want to live in a perfect society, well utopia doesn’t exist. It is human to have flaws. You know what. Fuck it. Why should I have to explain myself to you survivors when half of this shit I say you shitheads won’t understand and if you can then woopie fucking do. That just means you have something to say as my reason for killing. And the majority of the audience won’t even understand my motives either! They’ll say “ah, he’s crazy, he’s insane, worthless! All you fuckers should die! DIE! What the fuck is the point if only some people see what I am saying, there will always be ones who don’t, ones that are to dumb or naïve or ignorant or just plain retarded. If I can’t pound it into every single persons head then it is pointless. Fuck money fuck justice fuck morals fuck civilized fuck rules fuck laws . . . DIE manmade words . . . people think they apply to everything when they don’t/can’t. There’s no such thing as True Good or True evil, it’s all relative to the observer. It’s just all nature, chemistry, and math. Deal with it. But since dealing with it seems impossible for mankind, since we have to slap warning labels on nature, then . . . you die, burn, melt, evaporate, decay. Just go the fuck away. YAAAAAA!!! “When in doubt, confuse the hell out of the enemy.” Fly 9/2/98 KEIN MITLEID wait, mercy doesn’t exist. . .
1998-06-12‎Here’s something to chew on . . . today I saw a program on the discovery channel about satellites and radar and aircraft and stuff, and at the end of the show the narrator said some things that made me think “damn, we are so advanced, we kick ass, America is awesome, we have so many things in our military, we would kick anyone’s ass.” For a minute I actually had some pride in our nation . . . then I realized, “hey, this is only the GOOD things that I am seeing here. Only the pros, not the cons. Maybe that’s what people see, only the pros, and that’s why they are under control, but me, I see all . . . you can only blind me for so long, but alas, I have realized that Yes, the human race is still indeed doomed. It just needs a few kick starts, like me, and hell, maybe even . If I can wipe a few cities off the map, and even the fuckhead holding the map, then great. Hmm, just thinking if I want all humans dead or maybe just the quote-unquote “civilized, developed, and known-of” places on Earth, maybe leave little tribes of natives in the rain forest or something. Hmm, I’ll think about that. Eh, done for tonight. REB
1998-07-29‎As part of the human race, and having the great pleasure of being blessed with a brain, I can think. Humans can do whatever they want. There is no laws of nature that prevent humans from making choices. Maybe from actually DOING some of those choices, but not from making the choice. If a man chooses to speed while driving home one day then it is his fault for whatever happens. If he crashes into a school bus full of kiddies and they all burn to death, it’s his fault. It’s only a tragedy if you think it is, and then it’s only a tragedy in your own mind so you shouldn’t expect others to think that way also. It could also be a miracle for another person maybe that bus stopped the car from plowing into a little old lady walking on the sidewalk, one could think it was a “miracle” that she wasn’t hit. You see, anything and everything that happens in our world is just that, a HAPPENING. Anything else is relative to the observer, but yet we try to have a “universal law” or “code” of what is good and bad and that just isn’t fuckin correct. We shouldn’t be allowed to do that. We aren’t GODS, just because we are at the top of the food chain with our technology doesn’t mean we can be “judges” of nature. Sure we can think what we want, but you can “think” and “behave” you can judge people and nature all you want, but you are still wrong! Why should your morals apply to everyone else. “Morals” is just another word, and that’s it. I think we are all a waste of natural resources and should be killed off, and since humans have the ability to choose . . . and I’m human . . . I think I will choose to kill and damage as much as nature allows me to so take that, fuck you, and eat napalm + lead! HA! Only nature can stop me. I know I could get shot by a cop after only killing a single person, but hey guess the fuck WHAT! I chose to kill that one person so get over it! It’s MY fault! Not my parents, not my brothers, not my friends, not my favorite bands, not computer games, not the media. IT is MINE! Go shut the fuck up! -REB- 
1998-10-23‎Someone’s bound to say “what were they thinking?” when we go NBK or when we were planning it, so this is what I am thinking. “I have a goal to destroy as much as possible so I must not be sidetracked by my feelings of sympathy, mercy, or any of that, so I will force myself to believe that everyone is just another monster from Doom like FH or FS or demons, so it’s either me or them. I have to turn off my feelings.” Keep this in mind, I want to burn the world, I want to kill everyone except about 5 people, who I will name later, so if you are reading this you are lucky you escaped my rampage because I wanted to kill you. It will be very tricky getting all of our supplies, explosives, weaponry, ammo, and then hiding it all and then actually planting it all so we can achieve our goal. But if we get busted any time, we start killing then and there, just like Wilks from the ALIENS books, I ain’t going out without a fight. Once I finally start my killing, keep this in mind, there are probably about 100 people max in the school alone who I don’t want to die, the rest, MUST FUCKING DIE! If I didn’t like you or if you pissed me off and lived through my attacks, consider yourself one lucky god damn NIGGER. Pity that a lot of the dead will be a waste in some ways, like dead hot chicks who were still bitches, they could have been good fucks. Oh well, too fucking bad. Life isn’t fair. . . . not by a long fuckin shot when I’m at the wheel, too. God I want to torch and level everything in this whole fucking area but bombs of that size are hard to make, and plus I would need a fuckin fully loaded A-10 to get every store on Wadsworth and all the buildings downtown. Heh, imagine THAT you fuckers, picture half of Denver on fire just from me and Vodka. Napalm on sides of skyscrapers and car garages blowing up from exploded gas tanks. . . . oh man that would be beautiful.
1998-11-01‎You know what, I feel like telling about lies. I lie a lot. Almost constant, and to everybody, just to keep my own ass out of the water. And by the way (side note) I don’t think I am doing this for attention, as some people may think. Let’s see, what are some big lies I have told; “yeah I stopped smoking;” “for doing it not for getting caught,” “no I haven’t been making more bombs,” “no I wouldn’t do that,” and of course, countless of other ones, and yeah I know that I hate liars and I am one myself, oh fucking well. It’s ok if I am a hypocrite, but no one else, because I am higher than you people, no matter what you say if you disagree I would shoot you. And I am one racist mother fucker too, fuck the niggers and spics and chinks, unless they are cool, but sometimes they are so fucking retarded they deserve to be ripped on. Some people go through life begging to be shot, and white fucks are just the same. If I could nuke the world I would, because so far I hate you all. There are probably around 10 people I wouldn’t want to die, but hey, who ever said life is fair should be shot like the others, too. KKK SS
1998-11-08‎Heh heh heh. I sure had fun this weekend. Let’s see, what really happened. Before going to Rock-n-Bowl we stopped by King Soopers and me and picked up some big ass stogies. We then went to Rock-n-Bowl and I had a few cigarettes and one of my brand new cigars. We then went back to ’s house where her mom had previously bought us all a fuck load of liquor. Personally I had asked for Tequila and Irish cream, Vodka got his Vodka, and there was beer, whiskey, schnapps, puckers, scotch, and of course, orange juice! So we had some fun there playing cards and making drinks. We eventually made it to bed at about 5 AM. Got up at 10, went to Safeway got some doughnuts and then I took Vodka home. The bottle of Tequila is almost full and is in my car right by my spare tire and right by the bottle of Irish Cream. Heh heh. I’ll have to find a spot for those. And by the way, this Nazi report is boosting my love of killing even more. Like the early Nazi government, my brain is like a sponge, sucking up everything that sounds cool and leaving out all that is worthless. That’s how Nazism was formed, and that’s how I will be too!
1998-11-12‎Fuck you Brady!14 All I want is a couple of guns, and thanks to your fucking bill I will probably not get any! Come on, I’ll have a clean record and I only want them for personal protection. It’s not like I’m some psycho who would go on a shooting spree. . . . fuckers. I’ll probably end up nuking everything and fucking robbing some gun collector’s house. Fuck, that’ll be hard. Oh well, just as long as I kill a lot of fucking people. Everyone is always making fun of me because of how I look, how fucking weak I am and shit, well I will get you all back, ultimate fucking revenge here. You people could have shown more respect, treated me better, asked for my knowledge or guidance more, treated me more like a senior, and maybe I wouldn’t have been so ready to tear your fucking heads off. Then again, I have always hated how I looked, I make fun of people who look like me, sometimes without even thinking sometimes just because I want to rip on myself. That’s where a lot of my hate grows from. The fact that I have practically no self-esteem, especially concerning girls and looks and such. Therefore people make fun of me . . . constantly . . . therefore I get no respect and therefore I get fucking PISSED. As of this date I have enough explosions to kill about 100 people, and then if I get a couple bayonets, swords, axes, whatever I’ll be able to kill at least 10 more. And that just isn’t enough! Guns! I need guns! Give me some fucking firearms!
1998-11-17‎HATE! I’m full of hate and I love it. I HATE PEOPLE and they better fucking fear me if they know what’s good for ’em. Yes I hate and I guess I want others to know it, yes I’m a racist and I don’t mind. Niggs and spics bring it on to themselves, and another thing, I am very racist towards white trash P.O.S.’s like and they deserve the hatred, otherwise I probably wouldn’t hate them. It’s a tragedy, the human nature of people will lead to their downfall. People’s human nature will get them killed. Whether by me or Vodka, it’s happened before, and not just school shootings like those pussy dumbasses over in Minnesota who squealed. Throughout history, its our fucking nature! I know how people are and why and I can’t stand it! I love the Nazis too . . . by the way, I fucking can’t get enough of the swastika, the SS, and the iron cross. Hitler and his head boys fucked up a few times and it cost them the war, but I love their beliefs and who they were, what they did, and what they wanted. I know that form of government couldn’t have lasted long once the human equation was brought in, but damn it, it sure looked good. Every form of government leads to downfalls, everything will always fuck up or yeah something. It’s all doomed, god damn it. This is beginning to make me get in a corner. I’m showing too much of myself, my views and thoughts, people might start to wonder, smart ones will get nosy and something might happen to fuck me over, I might need to put on one helluva mask here to fool you all some more. Fuck fuck fuck. It’ll be very fucking hard to hold out until April. If people would give me more compliments all of this might still be avoidable . . . but probably not. Whatever I do people make fun of me, and sometimes directly to my face. I’ll get revenge soon enough. Fuckers shouldn’t have ripped on me so much huh! Ha! Then again it’s human nature to do what you did . . . so I guess I am also attacking the human race. I can’t take it, it’s not right . . . true . . . correct . . . perfect. I fucking hate the human equation. Nazism would be fucking great if it weren’t for individualism and our natural instinct to ask questions. You know what maybe I just need to get laid. Maybe that’ll just change some shit around. That’s another thing, I am a fucking dog. I have fantasies of just taking someone and fucking them hard and strong. Someone like where I just pick her up, take her to my room, tear off her shirt and pants and just eat her out and fuck her hard. I love flesh . . . weisses fleisch! Dein weisses fleisch erregt mich so, Ich bin doch nur ein Gigolo! I want to grab a few different girls in my gym class, take them into a room, pull their pants off and fuck them hard. I love flesh . . . the smooth legs, the large breasts, the innocent flawless body, the eyes, the hair, jet black, blond, white, brown, ahhh I just want to fuck! Call it teenager hormones or call it a crazy fuckin racist rapist. Es ist mir egal. I just want to be surrounded by the flesh of a woman, someone like who I wanted to just fuck like hell, she made me practically drool, when she wore those shorts to work . . . instant hard on . . . I couldn’t stop staring. And others like in my gym class, or whatever in my gym class, and others who I just want to overpower and engulf myself in them. Mmm. I can taste the sweet flesh now . . . the salty sweet, the animalistic movement . . . iccchhh . . . lieeebe . . . . . . . fleisccchhhh. “Weisses fleisch” — perfect song for me. Who can I trick into my room first? I can sweep someone off their feet, tell them what they want to hear, be all nice and sweet, and then “fuck ’em like an animal, feel them from the inside” as Reznor said. Oh — that’s something else . . . that one NIN (Nine Inch Nails) video I saw, “Broken” or “Closer” or something. The one where the guy is kidnapped and tortured like hell . . . actual hell. I want to do that too. I want to tear a throat out with my own teeth like a pop can. I want to gut someone with my hand, to tear a head off and rip out the heart and lungs from the neck, to stab someone in the gut, shove it up to their heart, and yank the fucking blade out of their rib cage! I want to grab some weak little freshman and just tear them apart like a wolf, show them who is god. Strangle them, squish their head, bite their temples in the skull, rip off their jaw, rip off their collar bones, break their arms in half and twist them around, the lovely sounds of bones cracking and flesh ripping, ahhh . . . so much to do and so little chances.
1998-11-22‎Well folks, today was a very important day in the history of Reb today, along with Vodka and someone else who I won’t name, we went downtown and purchased the following: a double barrel 12 ga. Shotgun, a pump action 12 ga. Shotgun, a 9mm carbine, 250 9mm rounds, 15 12 ga slugs, 40 shotgun shells, 2 switch blade knives, and a total of 4 10-round clips for the carbine. We . . . . . . . . have . . . . . . GUNS! we fucking got them you sons of bitches! HA! HA HA HA! Neener! Booga Booga. Heh. It’s all over now. This capped it off, the point of no return. I have my carbine, shotgun, ammo and knife all in my trunk tonight and they’ll stay there till tomorrow . . . after school you know, its really a shame. I had a lot of fun at that gun show, I would have loved it if you were there Dad. We would have done some major bonding. Would have been great. Oh well. But alas, I fucked up and told about my flask. that really disappointed me . I know you thought it was good for me in the long run and all that shit, smart of you to give me such a big raise and then rat me out. You figure it was supposed to cancel each other? God damn flask, that just fucked me over bigtime. Now you all will be on my ass even more than before about being on track. I’ll get around it though. If I have to cheat and lie to everyone than that’s fine. THIS is what I am motivated for, THIS is my goal. THIS is what I want “to do with my life.” You know what’s weird, I don’t feel like punching through a door because of the flask deal, probably cause I am fucking armed. I feel more confident, stronger, more God-like. I have confidence in my ability to deceive people, hopefully I’ll make it to April, but that might not happen. Ug, its been a busy weekend, I need to sleep, I’ll continue tomorrow.
1998-12-03‎Yesterday we fired our first firearms ever. 3 rounds from the carbine. Taught that ground a thing or 2. I even had the 2 clips in my pocket while talking to Vodka’s dad about senior ditch day. God it felt great firing off that bad boy, and hopefully I’ll be able to get more than just 4 clips for it. I dubbed my shotgun “Arlene” after Arlene Sanders from the DOOM books. She always did love the shotgun. Vodka’s OB is looking fucking awesome, all cut down to the proper lengths. This is a bitch trying to keep up with homework while working on my guns, bombs, and lying. By the way, I bought that flask in the mall and I had a friend fill it up with scotch whiskey, only had about 3 swigs in the 3 weeks I had it. Plus Monday I gave my T and IC to Vodka, just in case. I never really did like alcohol, just wasn’t my thing, but it felt good to just have around. That argument on the 22nd was a real bitch, but I think I should have won a fucking Oscar. I even quoted a few movies, remember “what the hell am I gonna do now man?! What am I gonna do!?” that’s good ole Hudson from “Aliens.” Sounded good too. And hey god damn it I would have been a fucking great marine. It would have give me a reason to do good. And I would never drink and drive, either. It will be weird when we actually go on the rampage. Hopefully we will have plenty of clips and bombs. I’m gonna still try and get my calico 9mm. Just think, 100 rounds without reloading. . . . hell yeah! We actually may have a chance to get some machine pistols thanks to the Brady bill. If we can save up about $200 real quick and find someone who is 21+ we can go to the next gun show and find a private dealer and buy ourselves some bad-ass AB-10 machine pistols. Clips for those things can get really fucking bit too.
1998-12-17‎woohoo, I’ll never have to take a final again! Feels good to be free. I just love Hobbes and Nietzsche. Well tomorrow I’ll be ordering 9 more 10-round clips for my carbine. I’m gonna be so fucking loaded in about a month. The big things we need to figure out now is the time bombs for the commons and how we will get them in and leave them there to go off, without any fuckin Jews finding them. I wonder if anyone will write a book on me. Sure is a ton of symbolism, double meanings, themes, appearance vs. reality shit going on here. Oh well, it better be fuckin good if it is written.
1998-12-20‎Heh, get this. KMFDM’s new album’s entitled “Adios” and its release date is in April. How fuckin appropriate, a subliminal final “Adios” tribute to Reb and Vodka, thanks KMFDM . . . I ripped the hell outa the system.
1998-12-29‎Jesus christ that was fucking close. Fucking shitheads at the gunshop almost dropped the whole project. Oh well, thank god I can BS so fucking well. I went and picked up those babies today, so now I got 13 of those niggers woohah. The stereo is very nice, but having no insurance payments to worry about so I could concentrate of BOMBS would have been better. Oh well, I think I’ll have enough. Now I just need to get Vodka another gun.
1999-04-03‎Months have passed. It’s the first Friday night in the final month. Much shit has happened. Vodka has a Tec 9, we test fired all of our babies, we have 6 time clocks ready, 39 crickets 24 pipe bombs, and the napalm is under construction. Right now I’m trying to get fucked and trying to finish off these time bombs. NBK came quick, why the fuck can’t I get any? I mean, I’m nice and considerate and all that shit, but nooooo. I think I try too hard. But I kinda need to, considering NBK is closing in. The amount of dramatic irony and foreshadowing is fucking amazing. Everything I see and hear I incorporate into NBK somehow. Either bombs, clocks, guns, napalm, killing people, any and everything finds some tie to it. Feels like a goddamn movie sometimes. I wanna try to put some mines and trip bombs around this town too maybe. Get a few extra frags on the scoreboard. I hate you people for leaving me out of so many fun things. And no don’t fucking say “well that’s your fault” because it isn’t, you people had my phone #, and I asked and all, but no. no no no don’t let the weird looking Eric KID come along, ooh fucking nooo.
‎I HATE trends!
‎people say it is immoral to follow others, they say be a leader. Well here is a fuckin news flash for you stupid shits, everyone is a follower! Everyone who says they aren’t followers and then dresses diff or acts diff. . ..they got that from something they saw on TV or in film or in life. No originality. How many Jo MAMMA jokes are there and how many do you think are original and not copied. KEINE. It’s a fucking filthy place we live in. All these standards and laws and great expectations are making people into robots even though they might “think” they aren’t and try to deny it. No matter how hard I try to NOT copy someone I still AM!
‎I always try to be different, but I always end up copying someone else.
‎ever wonder why we go to school? Besides getting a so-called education. It’s not too obvious to most of you stupid fucks but for those who think a little more and deeper you should realize it. Its society’s way of turning all the young people into good little robots.
‎I bet most of you fuckers can’t even think that deep . . . You aren’t human. You are a robot.
‎I don’t want to be like you or anyone which is almost impossible.
‎today I saw a program on the discovery channel about satellites and radar and aircraft and stuff, and at the end of the show the narrator said some things that made me think “damn, we are so advanced, we kick ass, America is awesome, we have so many things in our military, we would kick anyone’s ass.” For a minute I actually had some pride in our nation. . .then I realized, “hey, this is only the GOOD things that I am seeing here. Only the pros, not the cons. Maybe that’s what people see, only the Pros, and that’s why they are under control, but me, I see all.
‎Everything others do always will affect us, no matter what we think.
‎In this day and age, it is almost impossible to be original.
‎People do act on and believe in what they see, but they are still influenced by others.
‎My thoughts are the most original and distinctive part of my character.
‎It can be hard to be original in our generation.
‎My mind is so full of creative, original ideas that sometimes I have trouble keeping them at bay.
‎It is hard to describe my creative talents and to be sure that they are original.
‎Different people influence my life in different ways. Therefore it is important to learn how exactly they influence me.
‎Zeus and I both like to be powerful and have some control over what is happening. I am always asking questions or double-checking myself to be sure I completely understand something so I am in control.
‎Why are they sooo original!! If it’s made in a factory it’s not very freaking original!!
‎God damn trends!! Why are they sooo original!! If its made in a factory its not very freakin original!!
‎Do not think we’re trying to copy anyone. We had the idea before the first one ever happened.
‎Natural selection needs a boost, like me with a shotgun.
‎YOU KNOW WHAT I LOVE!!!? Natural SELECTION!!!!!!!!! God damn it’s the best thing that ever happened to the Earth. Getting rid of all the stupid and weak organisms. . .. . .but its all natural!!! YES! I wish the government would just take off every warning label. So then all the dumbasses would either severely hurt themselves or DIE! And boom, no more dumbasses.
‎You all better fucking hide in your houses because I’m comin for EVERYONE soon, and I WILL be armed to the fuckin teeth and I WILL shoot to kill and I WILL fuckin KILL EVERYTHING!
‎NATURAL SELECTION. Kill all retards, people with brain fuck ups, drug addicts, people who can’t figure out how to use a fucking lighter. Geeeawd! People spend millions of dollars on saving the lives of retards, and why. I don’t buy that shit like “oh, he’s my son, though!” so the fuck what, he ain’t normal, kill him. Put him out of his misery. He is only a waste of time and money, then people say ‘but he is worth the time, he is human too.’ No he isn’t, if he was then he would swallow a bullet cause he would realize what a fucking he was.
‎NATURAL SELECTION. Fucker should be shot. Same thing with all those rich snotty toadies at my school. Fuckers think they are higher than me and everyone else with all their $ just because they were born into it? Ich denk NEIN . . . Everyone should be put to a test, an ULTIMATE DOOM test, see who can survive in an environment using only ‘smarts’ and military skills. Put them in a Doom world, no authority, no refuge, no BS copout excuses. If you can’t figure out the area of a triangle or what “cation” means, you die! If you can’t take down a demon with a chainsaw or kill a hell prince with a shotgun, you die! Fucking snotty rich fuckheads who rely on others or on sympathy or $ to get them through life should be put to this challenge. Plus it would get rid of all the fat, retarded, crippled, stupid, dumb, ignorant, worthless people of this world. No one is worthy of this planet, only me and who ever I choose . . . Everyone should be shot out into space and only those people I say should be left behind.
‎But before I leave this worthless place, I will kill who ever I deem unfit for anything at all. Especially life.
‎The human race isn’t worth fighting for, only worth killing.
‎since we have to slap warning labels on nature, then . . . you die, burn, melt, evaporate, decay. Just go the fuck away. YAAAAAA!!!
‎If you recall your history the Nazis came up with a “final solution” to the Jewish problem. Kill them all. Well, in case you haven’t figured it out yet, I say “KILL MANKIND” no one should survive.
‎If I can wipe a few cities off the map, and even the fuckhead holding the map, then great. Hmm, just thinking if I want all humans dead or maybe just the quote-unquote ‘civilized, developed, and known-of’ places on Earth, maybe leave little tribes of natives in the rain forest or something. Hmm, I’ll think about that.
‎I think we are all a waste of natural resources and should be killed off.
‎I want to kill everyone except about 5 people.
‎If I could nuke the world I would, because so far I hate you all. There are probably around 10 people I wouldn’t want to die.
‎What’s 35% of 100? 1. 35 2. Germany France Spain Italy 3. Kansas Wyoming Nebraska Arizona I think that this is absolutely ridiculous, people who can’t answer questions like that should be shot.
‎I think students today are astonishingly stupid. It never ceases to amaze me how stupid and ignorant people can be. Seems like some try to be dumb. It’s a pity natural selection doesn’t apply to humans, otherwise I strongly believe the race as a whole would be better off.
‎It would be great if god removed all vaccines and warning labels from everything in the world and let natural selection take its course. All the fat ugly retarded crippled dumbass stupid fuckheads in the world would die. . .Maybe then the human race can actually be proud of itself . . . NBK. I love it! sometime in april me and V will get revenge and will kick natural selection up a few notches
‎You know what I HATE!!? MANKIND!!!! YeaaAAAAAAAH! Kill everything . . . kill everything.
‎i would love to be the ultimate judge and say if a person lives or dies . . . and say ‘you don’t deserve to live, you are worthless, die.
‎I think I would want us to go extinct.
‎Retards!!! They are a waste of time and money and effort and energy and space and lots of other stuff too! They need to DIE!!
‎Ich bin Gott
‎Ich bin Gott
‎Harris goes on to film his planning book and describes it as the ‘Writings of God.’
‎My belief is that if I say something, it goes. I am the law. If you don’t like it, you die.
‎Ich bin Gott
‎I feel like God and I wish I was, having everyone being OFFICIALLY lower than me. I already know that I am higher than most anyone in the fucking welt in terms of universal Intelligence. And where we stand in the universe compared to the rest of the UNIVERSE.
‎How dare you think that I and you are part of the same species when we are sooooooo different. You aren’t human. You are a robot.
‎they are under control, but me, I see all.
‎It’s ok if I am a hypocrite, but no one else, because I am higher than you people.
‎I want to grab some weak little freshman and just tear them apart like a wolf, show them who is god.
‎I am fucking armed. I feel more confident, stronger, more God-like.
‎Ich bin Gott
‎One looked like a World War II marine propaganda poster, except it read KMFDM on the top of it. Another had a pure American bald eagle, another said God-like.
‎I think students today are astonishingly stupid. It never ceases to amaze me how stupid and ignorant people can be . . . I am ashamed to be a part of the same species as some of these people.
‎You and me are the ones who should be running the world.
‎I would love to be the ultimate judge and say if a person lives or dies — be godlike.
‎I don’t want to brag about my own sh*t, but these levels come from the Herrgott of DOOM himself . . . Each level has 4 symbols in it, locate all of them and you are Godlike.
‎Ich bin Gott
‎most people “will not see the new world.
‎Eric wrote about his activities as taking place in “the pre-war era.
‎When I go NBK and people say things like, “oh, it was so tragic,” or “oh he is crazy!” or “It was so bloody.” I think, so the fuck what you think that’s a bad thing?
‎the human race is still indeed doomed. It just needs a few kick starts, like me.
‎Someone’s bound to say ‘what were they thinking?’ when we go NBK or when we were planning it, so this is what I am thinking. ‘I have a goal to destroy as much as possible.’
‎Once I finally start my killing, keep this in mind, there are probably about 100 people max in the school alone who I don’t want to die, the rest, MUST FUCKING DIE!
‎THIS is what I am motivated for, THIS is my goal. THIS is what I want ‘to do with my life.’
‎NBK came quick, why the fuck can’t I get any? I mean, I’m nice and considerate and all that shit, but nooooo. I think I try to hard. But I kinda need to, considering NBK is closing in.
‎NBK. I love it! Sometime in april me and V will get revenge and kick natural selection up a few notches. . .maybe we will even start a little rebellion or revolution to fuck things up as much as we can.
‎God I can’t wait till they die. I can taste the blood now. NBK und KMFDM.
‎You all need to die! We need to die, too! We need to fucking kick-start the revolution here! . . . We need a fucking kick-start. If we have a fucking religious war — or oil — or anything. We need to get a chain reaction going here.
‎Our actions are a two man war against everyone else.
‎I really am sorry about all of this . . . but war’s war
‎there’s a cop — let’s get that cop
‎let’s go kill some cops now
‎All these standards and laws and great expectations are making people into robots.
‎People (ie, parents, cops, God, teachers) telling me what to makes me not want to fucking do it!
‎Society tries to make everyone act the same by burying all human nature and instincts. That’s what schools, laws, jobs, and parents do.
‎Fuck money fuck justice fuck morals fuck civilized fuck rules fuck laws.
‎we try to have a ‘universal law’ or ‘code’ of what is good and bad and that just isn’t fuckin correct.
‎I know I could get shot by a cop after only killing a single person, but hey guess the fuck WHAT! I chose to kill that person.
‎By that time cops will be all over us and we start to kill them too!
‎cops! Stupid law enforcing people!!!
‎The ONE person you hate the most: “are cops one person?”
‎Don’t follow your dreams or goals or any of that shit, follow your fucking animal instincts. If it moves, kill it, if it doesn’t, burn it.
‎Human nature is smothered out by society, job, and work and school. Instincts are deleted by laws.
‎Society tries to make everyone act the same by burying all human nature and instincts. That’s what schools, laws, jobs, and parents do . . . the few who stick to their natural instincts are casted out as psychos or lunatics or strangers or just plain different. Crazy, strange, weird, wild, these words are not bad or degrading. If humans were let to live how we would naturally, it would be chaos and anarchy and the human race wouldn’t probably last that long, but hey guess what, that’s how its supposed to be!!!!! Societies and government are only created to have order and calmness, which is exactly the opposite of pure human nature.
‎Women, you will always be under men. It’s been seen throughout nature, males are almost always doing the dangerous shit while the women stay back. It’s your animal instincts.
‎I really don’t give a good god damn about what you think is ‘right’ and what is ‘wrong’ and what is acceptable and what isn’t nice, I just don’t fucking CARE! SHUTUP AND DIE!!!!!!!
‎No I am not crazy, crazy is just a word, to me it has no meaning.
‎Sorry is just a word.
‎There is no such thing as an actual ‘real world.’ Its just another word like justice, sorry, pity, religion, faith, luck and so on.
‎Just because your mumsy and dadsy told you blood and violence is bad, you think it’s a fucking law of nature? Wrong.
‎your social words, ‘normal’ or ‘civilized’
‎Fuck money, fuck justice, fuck morals, fuck civilized, fuck rules, fuck laws. . .DIE manmade words . . . There’s no such thing as True Good or True evil.
‎‘Morals’ is just another word, and that’s it.
‎Bloody snotty people think they are god almighty.
‎I will rig up explosives all over a town and detonate each one of them at will after I mow down a whole fucking area of you snotty ass rich mother fucking high strung godlike attitude having worthless pieces of shit whores.
‎All those rich snotty toadies at my school. Fuckers think they are higher than me and everyone else with all their $ just because they were born into it.
‎Fucking snotty rich fuckheads who rely on others or on sympathy or $ to get them through life.
‎Young smokers! They think they are so god damn cool with their big bad cigarettes and their ‘sooo cool’ attitude.
‎You know what I hate!!!? People who think they can forecast the weather!!! Then they think that everyone else will think that they are cool.
‎People who think they are martial arts experts! They are all cocky and thinking they are all big and bad.
‎You know what I hate!!!? Rappers and their oh so smooth cool suave rapper attitude.
‎People who like SKA give the rest of the human race a bad name!! They think they are soooo cool.
‎hanson!!! Stupid little posers who think they are cool!
‎YOU KNOW WHAT I LOVE!!!? When some stupid retarded kid blows his hand off because he couldn’t figure out that a lit fuse means that the firecracker is going to go off soon! HAHAHA!!
‎YOU KNOW WHAT I HATE!! RACISM!! Anyone who believes that blacks, Asians, Mexicans, or people from any other country or race besides white-American . . . people who think that should be drug out into the street, have their arms ripped off, be be burnt at the stumps, then have every person of the race that YOU hate come out and beat the shit out of you, and if you are female, then you should be raped by a male from the race you hate and be forced to raise the child!
‎Maybe I just need to get laid. Maybe that’ll just change some shit around. That’s another thing, I am a fucking dog. I have fantasies of just taking someone and fucking them hard and strong. Someone like where I just pick her up, take her to my room, tear off her shirt and pants and just eat her out and fuck her hard . . . I want to grab a few different girls in my gym class, take them into a room, pull their pants off and fuck them hard. I love flesh . . . the smooth legs, the large breasts, the innocent flawless body, the eyes, the hair, jet black, blond, white, brown, ahhh I just want to fuck! Call it teenager hormones or call it a crazy fuckin racist rapist.
‎I just want to overpower and engulf myself in them . . . Who can I trick into my room first? I can sweep someone off their feet, tell them what they want to hear, be all nice and sweet, and then ‘fuck ’em like an animal, feel them from the inside’ as Reznor said. Oh — that’s something else . . . that one NIN video I saw, ‘Broken’ or ‘Closer’ or something. The one where the guy is kidnapped and tortured like hell . . . actual hell. I want to do that too. I want to tear a throat out with my own teeth like a pop can. I want to gut someone with my hand, to tear a head off and rip out the heart and lungs from the neck, to stab someone in the gut, shove it up to their heart, and yank the fucking blade out of their rib cage! I want to grab some weak little freshman and just tear them apart like a wolf, show them who is god. Strangle them, squish their head, bite their temples in the skull, rip off their jaw, rip off their collar bones, break their arms in half and twist them around, the lovely sounds of bones cracking and flesh ripping, ahhh . . . so much to do and so little chances.
‎First we will go to the house of and in the morning before school starts and before anyone is even awake. We go in, we silently kill each inhabitant and then pin down and . Then take our sweet time pissing on them, spitting on them, and just torturing the hell out of them.
‎YOU KNOW WHAT I HATE!!!? HOMOSEXUALS!! It is just plain WRONG.
‎People always say we shouldn’t be racist. Why not? Blacks ARE different. Like it or not they are. They started out on the bottom so why not keep em there. It took them centuries to convince us that they are equal but they still use their color as an excuse or they just discriminate us because we are white. Fuck you, we should ship yer black asses back to Afrifuckingca were you came from. We brought you here and we will take you back. America = white. Gays . . . well all gays, ALL gays, should be killed. Mit keine fragen. Lesbians are fun to watch if they are hot but still, its not human. It’s a fucking disease. You don’t see bulls or roosters trying to fuck, do you? No, I didn’t think so. Women, you will always be under men. It’s been seen throughout nature, males are almost always doing the dangerous shit while the women stay back. It’s your animal instincts, deal with it or commit suicide, just do it quick.
‎If you recall your history the Nazis came up with a ‘final solution’ to the Jewish problem. Kill them all. Well, in case you haven’t figured it out yet, I say ‘KILL MANKIND’ no one should survive.
‎If I didn’t like you or if you pissed me off and lived through my attacks, consider yourself one lucky god damn NIGGER.
‎I am one racist mother fucker too, fuck the niggers and spics and chinks, unless they are cool, but sometimes they are so fucking retarded they deserve to be ripped on.
‎KKK SS
‎by the way, this Nazi report is boosting my love of killing even more. Like the early Nazi government, my brain is like a sponge, sucking up everything that sounds cool and leaving out all that is worthless. That’s how Nazism was formed, and that’s how I will be too!
‎I’m a racist and I don’t mind. Niggs and spics bring it on to themselves.
‎I love the Nazis too . . . by the way, I fucking can’t get enough of the swastika, the SS, and the iron cross. Hitler and his head boys fucked up a few times and it cost them the war, but I love their beliefs and who they were, what they did, and what they wanted. I know that form of government couldn’t have lasted long once the human equation was brought in, but damn it, it sure looked good.
‎Nazism would be fucking great if it weren’t for individualism and our natural instinct to ask questions.
‎The big things we need to figure out now is the time bombs for the commons and how we will get them in and leave them there to go off, without any fuckin Jews finding them.
‎I hate this kind of fuckin music. Goddamn white bushy apes and spear chuckers snappin their gay little fingers and tapping their faggot little shoes. . . their gay little nightclub. . . no jungle bunnies running around banging on things.
‎Supa Nigga!
‎Philosophy: My belief is that if I say something, it goes. I am the law, if you don't like it, you die. If I don't like you or I don't like what you want me to do, you die. If I do something incorrect, oh fucking well, you die. Dead people cant do many things, like argue, whine, bitch, complain, narc, rat out, criticize, or even fucking talk. So thats the only way to solve arguments with all you fuckheads out there, I just kill! God I cant wait till I can kill you people. Ill just go to some downtown area in some big ass city and blow up and shoot everything I can. Feel no remorse, no sense of shame. Ich sa ge FICKT DU! I will rig up explosives all over a town and detonate each one of them at will after I mow down a whole fucking area full of you snotty ass rich mother fucking high strung godlike attitude having worthless pieces of shit whores. i don't care if I live or die in the shootout, all I want to do is kill and injure as many of you pricks as I can, especially a few people. Like brooks brown. America: Love it or leave it mother fuckers. All you racist (and if you think im a hypocrite, come here so I can kill you) mother fucking assholes in America who burn our flags and disgrace my land, GET OUT! And to you assholes in iraq and iran and all those other little piece of shit desert lands who hate us, shut up and die! We will kick your ass if you try to fuck with us or atleast I will! I may not like or government or the people running it or things like that, but the physical land and location I DO fucking love! So love it or leave it! Society: I live in denver, and god damnit I would love to kill almost all of its residents. Fucking people with their rich snobby attitude thinkin they are all high and mighty and can just come up and tell me what to do and then people I see in the streets lying their fucking asses off about themselves. And then there is all you fitness fuck heads saying shit like "yeah do 50 situps and 25 pushups each morning and run a mile every day and go to the gym and work out and just push yourself to be better and you can achieve anything and set high goals and have great expectations and be happy and be kind and treat everyone equal and give to charity and help the poor and stop violence and drive sately and don't pollute and don't litter and cake shorter showers and don't waste water and eat right food and don't smoke or drink and don't sell guns and don't be a bad person"...phew. I say "fuck you...shutup...and die..." And then pull the trigger of a DB#3 that is in your fucking mouth. All you fucking people with your set standards and shit, like you have to go to college and be smart and shit, and you have to have a job and pay taxes, blah blah fucking blah, shutup and DIE! I really don't give a good god damn about what you think is "right" and what is "wrong" and what is acceptable and what isnt nice, I just don't fucking CARE! SHUTUP AND DIE!!!!!!!
‎Wie gehts. Well all you people out there can just kiss my ass and die. From now on I don't give a fuck what almost any of you mutha fuckas have to say, unless i respect you which is highly unlikely, but for those of you who happen to know me and know that i respect you, may piece be with you and dont be in my line of fire. for the rest of you, you all better fucking hide in your houses because im comin for everyone soon, and i WILL be armed to the fuckin teeth and i WILL shoot to kill and i WILL fucking KILL EVERYTHING! No i am not crazy. crazy is just a word. to me it has no meaning. everyone is different. but most of you fuckheads out there in society, going to your everyday fucking jobs and doing your everyday routine shitty things, i say fuck you and die. if you got a problem with my thoughts, come tell me and ill kill you, because.........god damnit, DEAD PEOPLE DONT ARGUE! God DAMNIT I AM PISSED!!

Getting rid of all the stupid and weak orginisms...but its all natural!! YES! I wish the government would just take off every warning label. So then all the dumbasses would either severely hurt themselves or DIE! And boom. no more dumbasses. heh YOU KNOW WHAT I HATE!? -ASSHOLES THAT CUT!!!!! Why the fuck cant you wait like every other human on earth does. If you cut, you are the following: Stuck up, self centered. sefish. lazy. impatient. rude, and... damn I ran out. anyway. Every fucking line I get into I end up having to wait a fucking hour when there WAS only me and other person in the line! Then the queer sucking asshole lets all his/her so called friends cut in behind em! If that happens 1 more time I will have to start referring to the Anarchists cookbook (bomb section). YOU KNOW WHAT I REALLY HATE!!? --LIARS!!! OH GAWWWWWD I HATE LIARS. And living in this fucking neighborhood there is thousands of them!!! Why the fuck must people lie so damn much! Especially about stupid things! Like "Yeah, i just bought 5 cases of M-80's in Oklahoma for about $5. And they are legal there and everything. Yeah my parents buy most of my guns. every once in a while ill use my 4.000 dollar paycheck and buy a shotgun or 2. And my brand new hummer just broke down on the highway when was going 250mph. Stupid cars like that. now. what fucking part if any would a normal human being believe? And thats just one person!! Another BIG example is Brooks Brown(303-972-0602) Now. according to him, he has a 215 IQ. 5 other homes (2 in alaska, and 3 in Florida). 95mph fast ball (he is only 16). runs a mile in about 5 minutes, has an uncle thats the former head of all the armed forces and has access to... Theee Button... his other uncle is a multi-millionare that lives in downtown detroit, and his neighbors are the chick that sung "r.e.s.p.e.c.t." and the lead singer of Aerosmith. And that same uncle owns 30% of the stock of that tylenol company. And his grandparents give... GIVE... him about 1000 dollars for each month. and his other Grandpa can blow up every house in America because all the houses have C-4 in the foundations Again. according to Brook Brown.

‎Hey wasuuup. REBEL NEWS: Atlanta, Pholus, Peltro, and Pazzie are complete. for those of you that dont know who they are, they are, they are the first 4 true pipe bombs created entirely from scratch by the rebels (REB and VODKA). Atlanta and Pholus are each 1 1/4" by 6" pipes, Petro is 1" by 6", and Pazzie is 3/4" by 5". Each if packed with powder that we got from fountains, morter shels, and crackering balls.

God DAMNIT I AM PISSED!!
‎NEXT MISSION=aaaan whenever. Ok people, im gonna let you in on the big secret of our clan. We aint no god damn stupid ass quake clan! We are more of a gang. We plan out and execute missions. Anyone pisses us off, we do a little deed to their house. Eggs, teepee, superglue, busyboxes, large amounts of fireworks, you name it and we will probly or already have done it. We have many enimies in our school, therefor we make many missions. Its sort of a night time tradition for us. Download CORRIDOR.MAP. Its a very close replica of the mission sites. But we have never seen the inside of the house...so we just guessed. Its also cut off where the area isnt important (ya know, i didnt want to put in all of the neighborhood:). The mission has been done. And the rebels...once again...emerged victorious. Vee talking blew de sheeeit outta lossa stocf!! As for the next mission, we havent decided what to do or where to do it. I had some thoughts about hiding in some large bushes or trees and shooting stuff. or maybe some more arial attacks. But we need to go up to Wyoming and load up on that stuff. We are running low. Plus we just got our paychecks....they arent big...but they can cover quite a bit of shit. We still need to get the fuses too. So far, the next mission will probly be in July sometime. But we AINT SURE. :MISSION LOGS:
‎6: Awwww yeya. This mission was so fuckin fun man. ok, first of all, my dad was the only parent home, so it was much easier getting out...but still hard since all these rocks in my backyard make so much noise. Plus the neighbors faulting dog barking its faulting head off. First we went through the corridor...going through some very tall grass fields...not as tall as the ones in the Lost World, but close. Felt kinda cool. Then we set up the strip of 1132 fire crackers. Using 2 ciggarettes as starting fuses, we had plenty of time to spare. We also had a nice little crackering fountain hooked up to the fuses too. After a few minutes of setting it up, we lit it and went over and hid in ontop of this big cement pipe going under a street. We were on the side of a hill so we hid in the grass. There was also a full moon that night, and not a foaming cloud in the sky. So it was like noon on the equator when we were out in the open. But, black clothing and tall grass sure helps. After about 5 minutes (forever) it began. Beforehand we watched as some lights in the Targets house went on.....then off. Maybe the bastard heard something. But when the strip started, he turned his bedroom lights off. The strip lasted for about 30 seconds.....we think...it was very fucking long. almost all of it went off. loud and bright. everything worked exactly how we wanted it to. After about 15 minutes we started down the bike trail to the next target. The first targets lights were on again in the bedroom, but we think we got away undetected. While we were walking to the next target, we shot some stuff. Heh, VoDkA brought his sawed off BBgun and a few BB's too. So we loaded it, pumped it, and fired off a few shots at some houses and trees and stuff. We probably didnt do any damage to any houses, but we arent sure. The gun was not loud at all, which was very good. At the next target, we set up the saturn missle battery and the rockets. These both has fuses about 2-3 feet long. I lit them as VoDkA and KiBBz were over hiding in the shadows. Luckily there were some trees and stuff at the 2nd target so we could hide pretty good. Anyway, i lit and went over to the others. We watched as the fuses burned and burned...then the rockets went off. It was pretty nice, not so much ment as a prank, but more as a nice little fireworks show. They made some noise, but nothing to shit yer pants about. But the battery didnt werk. So i went back, checked it out, and the fuse had burned down to about 2 inches, so I just said up yours baby and lit it. right as i made it to the others it went off. It was pretty quick, and loud too. Since the missiles are whistlers, they probly woke up a few residents. YEY. Then we started heading up to this construction site. Its right on the side of a kinda busy road, but before the houses. We dodged a few cars, messed around at the site. And we also swiped some signs from this fence that was put up around the soon-to-be-foundation of whatever is being built. The signs read "RENT-A-FENCE" and had some 1 800 number on them. So we got some very nice souvoneers (spelled close enuf) from that place. Then, as KIBBz and VoDkA were down in the foundation hole and I was up ontop, a cop drove by. We had enough time to see it, take cover, and watch it go by, so it didnt get us by suprise. But once we saw it was a cop we decided it was time to farming LEAVE. He didnt stop, he drove right by, but shit he mighta been looking for us. So we got out of the fence, grabbed our signs and went to the neighborhood again. We didnt have that much trouble getting back home, just some dogs and shit. Once we got in, we were tired as a priest after a 5 hour orgy. The total mission took about 3 hours. We left around 12:30 and got back around 3-3:30. We arent very sure but it lasted a while. And damit, it was well worth it. We needed that mission too, we were all pretty tired of waiting and our nerves were just about shot. So it was perdy relaxing to be free like that. 
‎5 This mission was one of the best we ever did. This was from Kibbz's house to several locations in his neighborhood. That night was probly the longest walk we ever did. First we went to this soccer field/playground. It was right on the corner of a very busy intersection. So every minute we had cars goin by. There was a lot of moonlight that night, We got to the playground and dodged the lights of cars for about 20 minutes. Then we decided what our first strike would be like. We got a big McD's cup, and went to center field of the soccer field. We got out aobut 20 bottlerockets that were stripped together, and a 100somethin strip of blackcats. Each had very good and long fuses so we had lots of time. We lit them, and ran over and got in front of these big pine trees. We were totally out of vision. The rockets went off first. They launched out over the field and then the strip went off, after that we started goin back the way we came. Which went through this trail about 35yards wide with houses on either side. We found this large metal tub...perfect for firecrackers!!! We decided that Kibbz and Vodka would walk off toward the street on the other side of the trail and hide behind some trees while i lit it. Except...the street was over 100 yards away. And they were aobut 15yards past it. Once they signaled me, I lit the small assortment of thunderbombs and about 50 stickless bottle rockets. They would only make sound, no visual effects. But anyway, I lit and sprinted the whole f*ckin way. About 3/4ths the way the fireworks went off, I was right in the middle of this bigass trail. I never ran so fast in all the missions. But I made it to the others and watched all these lights go on from the houses. Then we walked over to this big open hill between some houses and a busy street. We got a long wooden board and placed it on the hill. We had a long strip of about 200 and a little brick of about 3 packs of thunderbombs. This time we used a cigarette fuse. we only neeeded about an inch of it. We lit the cigarette and went over to hide behind some trees. When it went off it was VERY loud where we were so we bolted outa there. After a few minutes we went back to see if all the stuff had gone off and it all did. So we got some souvaneers (i know misspelled) and went home. Drank some Aftershock that night too. We were supposed to have a few chicks come with us, but they couldnt make it...so may be next time.
‎4 This mission was frehkin unique. The mission was from my house (REB), through the corridor, past the graves, and to the place where we do all of our fireworks. It was supposed to be like the other missions to this place. The weather was nice, we had 4 items made up and ready for use. The first fuse didnt work. The second fuse malfunctioned also. Both of those items were just about 100-120 thunderbombs stripped together. We had one more like the first 2 and we also had a little contraption of bottlerockets. These bottle rockets were stripped together, and put into a bottle. We placed this bottle on top of a large hill. So quite a few people could see. After about the 3rd try, I decided to just light the fuses that were directly from the rockets. Usually we use loooong fuses so we have time to get away. But this time, with Vodka and Kibbz standing over infront of some bigass shrubbery. I just did the direct fuse. After lighting it i ran like a sonuvabitch to Vodka and Kibbz. By the time i made it to them the rockets were starting to go off. We had aobut 50 in the assortment, so it lasted a while. It was rather perrrty. Then we busted the bottle and went BACK to the 2 strips that didnt work.They both had rather crappy quality fuses so they went out before they reached there target. I took the last one, tied the remainder of the first 2 fuses to it, and lit it for the final f*ckin time. Since I am the fastest in the group, I usually light the fuses and Kibbz would be at the point where we stop running. Vodka would keep guard while i light. This time both of them went over and laid down on the side of this hill about 100yards away. This would be the first time we have ever seen our own work in action. All the other times we just heard them. I lit it, ran to the hill, and watched the lovely ass fireworks go off. They lasted about 45 seconds, a total of around 400 went off. Dogs were barkin and everything. It was really cool to see em all to. After that we went to this point in the trails that looked like the Q from quake. We smoked some cigars, and headed home. Except...when we were a few blocks away from home, we had an incident. We were walking along the sidewalk when a f*cking garage door opened at the house that we were right by! We bolted into that persons yard...and ducked downand tried to be as quite as possible. This adult came out, got his newspaper(it was about 4:30 in the AM) and went back in. I tried to signal Vodka and Kibbz but they didnt see me. We waited...a few minutes later the man got in his car aand started down his driveway. The flood of lights from his car just covered us. He stopped, got out, and yelled "WHO ARE YOU!" we got up, said we were just passin throuigh and stuff, and he kept sayin "GET OUT OF HERE", "ILL CALL THE COPS!" and "WHO ARE YOU." We f*ckin hauled assholes and elbows home. This mission was also liquor free as a result of this person named Brooks Brown (phone #) who tried to narc on us. Telling my parents that i had booze and @#%$ in my room. I had to ditch every bottle I had and lie like a f*ckin salesman to my parents. All because Brooks Brown thought i put a little nik in his windshield from a snowball.......BS? yes, Anyway, that was mission 4.
‎3 This mission was an attack on the people who shot Vodka's bike, and on some random houses. First, after sneaking out of my house at around 1:55, we lit off 1 strand of 200 thunderbombs and 6 bottle rockets. We had also set a time delayed assortment too. This was made of 10 bottle rockets and a few crackering balls. We aren't really sure if those went off though because by the time they would have, we where a mile away. After the fireworks we went over to this assholes house. His name is brooks brown, phone number is 303-972-0602, address is 8003 S. Vance St. If any of you feel like pranking him. Anyway, we didn't really do much to him. Just put some model puddy on his Merc. Then, we went to another kids house, and started to teepee his big, tall, thick, thorny-ass-tree. We set off the motion detectors about 4 times, and we dodged 1 car. But we didn't get caught! His tree was completely covered and wrapped in ass whiping paper. Even though we only had 4 rolls, we did one helluva good job. After that we moved some rather large rocks onto peoples driveways and tagged RC into a fence. Then, we came home and got drunk while watching Bordello of Blood.
‎2 Our second mission was against this complete and utter fag's house. Everyone in our school hates this immature little weakling. So we decided to "hit" his house. On Friday night (2/7/97) at about 12:15AM we arrived at this queer's house. Fully equiped with 3 eggs, 2 roles of toilet paper, the cheap brand, no pretty flowers. (we were disappointed to) superglue, and the proper tools to make his phone box a busy box (for those of you that are stupid, a buy box is where you set their box so that when they try to make a call, they get a busy signal and when someone else calls, they get a busy signal too). We placed 2 eggs in his very large, thick bushes. We just barely cracked them open so they will be producing a rather repulsive and extremely BAD odor for sometime. We placed the last egg on his "welcome" mat. It was very neat, I cracked the egg, put the yoke in the center, and the 2 halves on either side of the yoke. Then we teepeed his large pine tree and this...oak? tree. I dont know, Its big though. It wasnt a complete teepee but it was enough to agitate the home owner greatly. We also put the superglue on the front door and on the little red mail box flag. 
‎1 The first was when we put an entire assortment of very loud fireworks in a tunel, and lit them of f at about 1:00AM. This mission was part of a rebellion against these assholes that shot one of our bikes one day. They were rather angry that night, and we were very happy. We will be doing another hit on their house sometime in the near future. And that one will be much closer. And louder. After each mission we get drunk. Not with wimpy beer, we only use hard liquor. Aftershock, Irish Cream, Tequila, Vodka, Whiskey, Rum, and sometimes a few shots of EVERCLEAR. We also sometimes make up our own shooters. And sample others (never try a prarie fire, its killer!). In our next few missions, we are planning to hit the dorks house a few more times, along with a few other houses. And also set off some more fireworks at that tunel. We each have a large suply of fireworks...loud ones...and soon I will have my liscense and we can drive around any place we want to. heh heh. Soon I will be putting our directions for mixing drinks that we make up. We will put up any good shooter or other drink that we try. So check this place out often.

Stupid cars." like that. now. what flaming part if any would a normal human being believe? And thats just one person!! Another BIG example is Brooks Brown(303- 972-0602). Now, according to him, he has a 215 IQ, 5 other homes (2 in alaska, and 3 in Florida), 95mph fast ball(he is only 16), runs a mile in about 5 minutes, has an uncle thats the former head of all the armed forces and has access to Theee Button..., his other uncle is a multi-millionare that lives in downtown detroit, and his neighbors are the chick that sang "r.e.s.p.e.c.t." and the lead singer of Aerosmith. And that same uncle owns 30% of the stock of that tylenol company. And his grandparents gives.. GIVES... him about 1000 dollars for each month, and his other Grandpa can blow up every house in America because all the houses have C-4 in the foundations.

YOU KNOW WHAT 1 HATE!!!? — R rated movies on CABLE! My DOG can do a better damn editing job than those tards!!!

‎Just A Day I seem to remember our fishing trips well. They were always preempted, never extemporaneously brought out by my father the night before his intended day of relaxation. How could one look forward to a trip if they did not know about it? Go to bed early, we have to get up at 5! Under normal circumstances, this would bring out a barrage of arguments & pouting, but going fishing was not an everyday thing. This was a good thing, as opposed to getting up for school or some other bullshit. I would wake up to black skies & coffee bean aromas making their way around the house. I never liked coffee, but I loved the smell. I would dine on fancy breakfast cuisine, otherwise known as Cocoa Puffs. My brother would already be up, trying to impress our father by forcing down the coffee he hadn't grown to like yet. I always remember my brother trying to impress everyone, and myself thinking what a waste of time that would be. I would go to the garage & get my fishing tackle together, & throw it in the back of our 74 Ram. By then my brother & father would have all the food & coolers ready, & they would be packing, ready to go. The drives up to the mountains were always peaceful, a certain halcyon hibernating within the tall peaks & the armies of pine trees. It seemed back then that when the world changed, these mountains would never move. They would remain at peace with themselves, and with anyone who would respect them. We arrived at the lake, but I don’t remember what the name of it is. The lake is almost vacant, except for a few repulsive, suburbanite assholes. I never liked those kind of people, they always seemed to ruin the serenity of the lake. I loved the water. I never went swimming, but the water was an escape in itself. Every so often, the waves would form a small pattern, & change current in an odd shape. I would always cast into those spots, thinking that the fish were more attracted to these parts of the water. Time to bait. I never liked salmon eggs, too much gooey crap that gets on your fingers. Instead, I went with a lour, even though this was a lake. I knew I would have to use eggs if I wanted any fish, but that didn't matter at the time. Cast, Reel, etc. countless times, and my mind would wander to wherever it would want to go. Time i seemed to stop when I was fishing. The lake, the mountains, the trees, all the wildlife shit that people seemed to take for granted, was here. Now. It was if their presence was necessary for me to be content. Time to go!. Done. Back to society. No regrets, though. Nature shared the secret serenity with someone who was actually observant enough to notice. Sucks for everyone else.
‎It would be great if god removed all vaccines and warning lables from everything in the world and let natural selection take its course. All the fat ugly retarded crippled dumbass stupid fuckheads in the world would die, and oh fucking well if a few of the good guys die to. Maybe then the human race can actually be proud of itself. World war II is the last time I bet America was proud of its self. We beat the fuck out of the damn zipperheads and the nazis. We came back, from being bombed and loosing major battles to nuke that little piece of shit island and to take over that cool place called Deustchland. I say its cool because I love the German language and "BRUTE" stuff. Kein mitleid fir die merheit. Put everyone in doom I and see who can get past atleast level 1. Actually, then put them into MY worlds. Like Thrasher, Whiskey, UAC Labs, und TIER. I would love to see all you fuckheads die. NBK. I love it! sometime in april me and V will get revenge and will kick natural selection up a few notches. Armed with the following, a terroist bag full of noisey crickets, noisey crickets strapped to WD40 cans, pipe bombs with a shit load of shrapnel, fire bombs, chlorine gas bombs, and smoke bombs. Fire arms we arent sure of yet, hopefully V will have his #3 and plenty of ammo for it. thats another thing, ill fuck around with some shotgun shells for more bombs iso. For me, I don't know what weapon ill have. I just want a firearm that can hold lots of bullets and that wont jam on me. So ill need lots of clips to. Ill have those strapped onto my chest. Maybe a bullet proof vest too. We will be in all black. Dusters, black army pants, and we will get custom shirts that say R or V in the background in one big letter and NBK in the front in a smaller font. We will have knifes and blades and backup weaponry all over our bodies, I will have a tattoo right arm. Once we start we will wear balaclavas. First we will go to the house of and in morning before school starts and before anyone is even awake. We go in, we silently kill each inhabitant and then pin down and Then take our sweet time pissing on them, spitting on them, and just torturing hell out of them. Once we are done there we set time bombs to burn the houses down and take any weaponry that we find, who knows we may get lucky. Then get totally prepared and during Alunch we go in and park in our spots. With sunglasses on we start carrying in all of our bags of terrorism and anarchism shit into our table. Being very casual and silent about it. its all for a science/band/english project or something. Then, we sit down, play some pumpup music, light a 50$ stoge, and get ready to start throwing out the first wave of crickets. Then, we light them, and throw them as far as we can, once the first wave starts to go off and the chaos begins, V opens fire and I start lobin the firebombs. Then I open fire and V starts lobin more crickets. Then if we can we go upstairs and go to each classroom we can and pick off fuckers at our will. If we still can we will hijack some awesome car, and drive off to the neighborhood of our choice and start torching houses with molotov cocktails, by that time cops will be all over us and we start to kill them to! we use bombs, fire bombs, and anything we fucking can to kill and damage as much as we fucking can. if it comes to the time when we are trapped with absolutely no way out, we eat crickets along with a ton of chlorine or some other deadly gas. so when we die, so will anyone close to us. if we have figured out the art of time bombs before hand, we will set hundreds of them around houses, roads, bridges, buildings and gas stations, anything that will cause damage and chaos, if you have ever seen the first few clips of violence in INVASION USA youll know what im talkin about, itll be like the LA riots, the Oklahoma bombing, WWII, Vietnam, duke and doom all mixed together, maybe we will even start a little rebelion or revolution to flick things up as much as we can. i want to leave a lasting impression on the world, and god damnit do not blame anyone else besides me and V for this, dont blame my family, they had no due and there is nothing they could have done, they brought me up just fucking fine, dont blame toy stores or any other stores for selling us ammo, bomb materials or anything like that because its not their fault, i dont want no fucking laws on buying fucking PVC pipes, we are kind of a select case here so dont think this will happen again, dont blame the school, dont fucking put cops all over the place just because we went on a killing spree doesnt mean everyone else will and hardly ever do people bring bombs or guns to school anyway, the admin. is doing a fine job as it is, i dont know who wll be left after we kill but damnit dont change any policies just because of us. it would be stupid and if there is any way in this fucked up universe we can come back as ghosts or what the fuck ever we will haunt the life out of anyone who blames anyone besides me and V. if by some wierd as shit luck my and V survive and escape we will move to some island somewhere or maybe mexico, new zelend or some exotic place where americans cant get us. if there isnt such place, then we will hijack a hell of a lot of bombs and crash a plane into NYC with us inside iring away as we go down, just something to cause more devistation.
‎wow im so glad i found u online, here i was just about to mail this to you: Well, i wrote my mom a 2 page note last night and put it on the counter, i told her about our conversations and why i stay up so late and how its my life and i am in control of it and a lot of other stuff that they have been bitching at me about, so we will have to see what they say about that when they get home from work tonight, im happy, i finally got the courage to tell my parents what i really think, i put it on paper so they wouldnt think i was "talking back" or haveing a "bad attitude" or
‎awesome, ok picture this: (typing) your in a large rectangular room, about 10 feet by 4 feet, it reminds you of the inside of a hull of a boat, there are old computer screens around you on the walls, except something is different about them, they are futuristic looking, but yet hundreds of years old. they are covered with dust and mold and vines, the only light in the room is from a full moonthat seems to dance around in the sky, so the shadows are all creeping around you. now, in the front of the room, and on the ground, are windows, you can see out the windows and you are looking onto a vast sea. large hill of water going uuup and doowwwn constantly, the only sound is the wind and the movement of the water, the room that you are in is moving, like a blimp would, and you are just standing there, staring out into the sea. that is one place i have imagined i would like to be. 
‎yeah, but its still nice, no people at all. kind of like, everyone is dead and has been for centuries, 
‎.....can only wish.
‎eventually i would only want 1 or 2 people.
‎it would be tough to decide who though.
‎what kind of people would you want with you?
‎if everyone was dead except say 4 or 5 of us. would you want to build up a new human race or eventually let us go extinct?
‎maybe if we were all sterile, (couldnt reproduce)
‎yeah, in our dreams, it would be great if we were that lucky i dont think i would want to bring a child into this world.
‎maybe its natures way. yeah. jst the world itself, i dont know. but i think i would want us to go extinct also.
‎like ancient civilizations have done, (pyramids, stone hedge, etc) rrrrrrr. i just wish i could actually DO this instead of just DREAM about it all
1998-08-31‎Webb Picture an Earth that has been obliterated by nuclear war and alien attacks leaving cities and military forces in ruins with only a lone marine as humanity’s last fighting force. Picture holographic walls, crushing ceilings, oceans of blood and lava, strange ancient artifacts, and horrible sour lemon and rotten meat stenches in the air. Imagine being trapped on an abandoned cold steel base floating in space for eternity, a leathery skinned monster roaming under a strobe light waiting for a fight, and astonishing weaponry designed to your special needs. All these places and ideas have been created and recreated many times by yours truly. It can be hard to be original in our generation, with so many movies, books, published ideas, and songs that can copied. People can combine ideas from several different fields and mix them into a new trend or fashion but, in reality, it is just more of the same. In order to tell of my creative talents, I must first tell my view on “creativity.” My mind is so full of creative, original ideas that sometimes I have trouble keeping them at bay. For the past three years, I have been involved in a computer game called Doom. Even though one might think it is just a game, I believe it is one of the best ways to show my creativity and intelligence. I believe creativity is a term that is relative to the observer. What one person may think is completely incredible and uncanny, another might think is just more of the same. In reality they both can be correct. I think that about a third of what an average high school student says in one day can be found in a movie or a book. While that student may not be plagiarizing on purpose, someone else might think they are. My point is that, for me, it is hard to describe my creative talents and to be sure that they are original and unique at the same time.
1998-08-31‎Webb Doom is a first-person “shoot-em-up” style game. So basically, one runs around levels and shoots at monsters with military weaponry. To most people it may be just another silly computer game, but to me it is an outlet for my thoughts and dreams. I have mastered changing anything that is possible to change in that game, such as the speed of weapons, the strength and mass of monsters, the textures and colors used on the floors and walls, and greatest of all, the actual levels that are used. Several times I have dreamed of a place or area one night, and then thought about it for days and days. Then, I would recreate it in Doom using everything from places in outer space with burned-out floor lights and dusty computers to the darkest depths of the infernal regions with minotaurs and demons running at me from every dark and threatening comer. I have also created settings such as eras of ancient abandoned military installations deep in monsterinfested forests with blood stained trees and unidentifiable mangled bodies covered with dead vines and others that portray to futuristic military bases on Mars overrun with zombies that lurk in every comer. These places may seem a bit on the violent side and, I assure you, some of them are. However, many times I have made levels with absolutely no monsters or guns in them. I have created worlds with beautiful, breath taking scenery that looks like something out of a science fiction movie, a fantasy movie, or even some “eldritch” from H. P. Lovecraft. Now, I know that other people are just as creative or more creative than I am, but I believe that I will always be the best at Doom creativity. In this day and age it can be hard to find a skill that can be completely dominated and mastered or a skill that almost no one else has. This is why I choose a simple computer game to express my talents.
‎ok, i am walking through this very deep forest at night time.J am wearing all this military gear like im a marine or something...there are these big flares going off way up high in the air and they are flying through the sky so there are shadows dancing all around, then i come out onto this beach that reminds me of one of those marine life posters with all the dolphins, whales, stars, oceans and everything, i look up into the stars and they are everywhere, like 10 times as many stars as you have ever seen, then i hear this voice saying "watch out for the f^^pe a swell time!" and i get launched into space right into the stars.
‎same here, i cant belive i remembered all that, sounds kind of fun thought guess F ** is a dream...! just get flashbacks during the day if I dream and that is ail I think about them
