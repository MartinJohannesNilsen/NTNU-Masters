2004-02-09‎I’m just too afraid of the future. I could do all I’ve planned, but then what if some bum gets a gun and shoots me? What if there’s a huge war? What if terrorists strike and I lose family? What if some fuck up kidnaps me, rapes me, tortures me, then kills me? Too much I’m afraid of. I’ve had issues the majority of my life. I still do, obviously. But I hoped I would get better and become a state trooper. I don’t ask for help, because what if I get better, then can’t be a cop? That’s all I want to do. But now I’m just too afraid. I believe whatever I believe will happen in the after-life, will happen. When I die I’m going to heaven. I’m NOT A MONSTER. I’ve been happy for a while, but it wasn’t true happiness, I just made it seem that way. Who should you blame? SOCIETY. My mom wanted to believe I was better, and I made it seem that way. Dr. Mooney couldn’t even see this coming. Christina just thought maybe suicide. Oh YEA, blame Four Winds. Those bastards were horrible. I faked my happiness to get out. My dad treated my family like shit, back in the day. Now he’s better, but the past hurts. He also told me I had no way of being a fireman when I was about ten or eleven. FAMILY Mom – I love you. You treated me like a King. Thank you for everything. It’s not your fault. Dad – You use to hit me, and you beat Matt a lot. Wouldn’t be surprised about you hitting Jay. Have a good few years. Jay – You were my father figure. Why do you think I played the bass? To be like you! I love you. Sometimes I acted like you were a bad bro, that was just in my head. You were a great brother. Thank you. Matt – We never really talked till I started Asheron’s Call. Ever since then, it’s been great. You too were a role-model to me. I love you. Thanks. Rachel – You lived with me the longest of the siblings. You were a GREAT sister! Tell Kayla and Tasha I said Good-Bye! They’re great people. I LOVE YOU! Lee – My cousin, we probably would’ve had a future together. We could’ve been like Kwinn and Kerri. Have fun with life, stay out of trouble. Aunt Donna + Uncle Hooch – You two were great to me. Aunt Donna giving me rides, and Uncle Hooch being my good friend. Remember when you invited everyone to Vermont? That was great. Playing Risk, I partnered with Hooch because he’s the God Father! Good times. Thanks. LOVE Jesse – We never really talked, but you offered help for me at HVCC. It was great talking with you at the wedding. Kwinn + Elizabeth – Wow, you two are great people! Kwinn gave me my first swiss army knife. That had no bad effect though, don’t worry! Sorry for the incident at Hatch Lake. If you two ever need financial help, go to my mom. It’s one of my last wishes that she helps you two. Love you! Uncle Scott + Aunt Lyn – Thanks for always having X-mas parties and Thanksgiving parties. Fun times. Kristi – Lil cous, I don’t know how much you’ll remember of me, but I just want you to know I’m not an evil person. I don’t want you to look back and think that I was. In a few years, I hope you’ll start to understand. To all other family – I’m sorry. FRIENDS Christina – Wow, you were a huge part of my life. You’re my babygirl, and I love you with all my heart. So sorry. Too many memories to say Kelli – IDK what to say. Thanks for the good times “GPF” – some of you were good friends. some weren’t Good-Bye, and good luck in life. Brad – You had issues, so do I. That’s why we fought. But now, we’re friends again. Thanks for the good times. I love you like a brother. Mike – You’re lucky, don’t fuck things up. Barry – You have issues. get some help Amy – You were one of the people that made me think, thanks. Love you Jessica – We haven’t talked lately, but thanks for the friendship Jenny – You were the first girl I cared about. Too bad we never hooked up. But I remember you kissed me on the cheek after a dance once. Hehe. People I Hate Mrs. Greer – Brad can explain. Bitch Mr. Cranell – Liar FUCK YOU Jeff McCabe – Talk shit behind my back. Fuck you, I hope you rot in Hell. There’s other friends and people I hate, but it’s time to watch “Bowling for Columbine” I’M SORRY I WISH IT Was DIFFERENT wait look on next page I’ve been watching Bowling for Columbine. How am I different than what the media says school shooters are? TV I watch: Jay Leno, Conan O’Brien, Family Guy, SNL, Mad TV, Simpsons, Law and Order, Monk, and others. oh, South Park! Man Show (Jimmy + Ad Music: Country music! Toby Keith! Movies: ok, movie I watch have some violence. Groose Pointe Blank, South Park, The Frighteners, Cruel Intentions, Animal House, Blown Away, 10 Things I Hate About You (yes a chick flick) and others, just ask my friends. I like to laugh! Comedies are good! I’m not what the media says I should be. But why Columbia (other than I hate it for obvious reasons)? About eleven months ago, I was in Four Winds. I told a couple people (Barry, Brad) because they wouldn’t care. But I guess everyone knew. And one day, Four Winds received a fax about people from Columbia saying that I said “I am going to kill myself and no one can stop me.” I figure that’s why I was there longer than I should have. So Columbia, IT’S YOUR FAULT.
2004-01-24‎Rachel, It’s January 24, 2004 and you’re leaving home. This time, I have a feeling you’ll be gone for a long time. Next thing you’ll know, I’ll be out of here! Life goes by quick. This letter is just to say good-bye, and I can’t wait to end up with something like Mom and her siblings have, with you, Jay and Matt. Me and you have been hanging out lately, but I can’t wait for the future. Just think about ten years from now. What will you do? Where will you live? Will you have kids? Be married? These questions apply for me, Jay and Matt too. Will you be Aunt Dex? LOL. What about thirty years from now? Will we all have kids? Will they get along? Who knows we’ll find out soon enough. Love, Jon
