Dear mom and dad I'm sorry about all
this is because some of my family and
friends hate me but I understand.
What I did this shooting is not because
of the shooting games, bullying or
other stuff, is because of the past
causes there were some bad things
in the past cause of me. And now I’m
just a monster. But I want to say
my last words. When I die I will go
back to the past and fix everything
so it can be the a great past. And the
shooting off sparks middle school
never should have happen. I wish
I can be a smart and a better kid
so I can be the better son in our
family. But if you hate me and my
family dosen’t love me it’s okay
I’m know that I’m just an idiot.

But I love you and I wish the past
would be good and better someday.

Dear teachers and students today is the day
when I kill you bastards for the embarressment
that you did. You say mean things in school.
That I'm gay, that I'm lazy, stupid, idiot.
and also say that I pee my pants and also
stealing my money. Well that all ends:
Today I will get revenage on the students and
teachers for ruinning my life. Today I will
bring a god damn pistol and rifle to shoot you
and see how you like it when someone making
fun of you. Once I kill you your life will
be noting but nightmare and bad dreams.
I don't care if I have alots of bullets to
shoot all of you, cause I'm gonna die tring on
my last stand. And right now this school will
now come to an end and your death will
be rising when I shoot you. Have a great
death at school.
