‎To whom it may concern My life is now gone to pot. I am going to eliminate certain people from this world. Those people are: Mrs. Wright Mr. Bronson and any other sucker who gets in my way. I am then going to kill myself so as not to be imprisoned. I am not insane but just strictly fed up with life. I am not getting myself anywhere and it's my fault I love my parents and my family and I know that they love me. Michael Peter Slobodian.
