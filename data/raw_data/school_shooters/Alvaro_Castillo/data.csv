2006-03-29‎Dear Journal, I am going to do it! I have been thinking about this moment sice the 10th grade. I am going to buy shotgun and I am going to commit suicide. I bought some audio casette tapes so I can explain to the police and my parents about why I did it. I plan to commit suicide on either April 20th or April 21st. April 20th is an obvious choice, for it is the seventh anniversary of the Columbine High School Massacre. However, I want to see the documentaries that they will show on the History Channel. If  is here, I will wait until he leaves. Then, I will commit the act. I will send Anna and e-mail telling her how much I love and care for her. I will tell her that I would pass by her house, and that I named my shotgun or rifle after her and the m-16 rifle in basic training I will also call  and confess to him what I will do. I have to do this. Every since that

2006-06-12‎Dear Journal, Well, today I gave Arlene a complete makeover. I turned her into Eric's shotgun I sawed off the barrel and stock of the shotgun with a hacksaw. It took a lot less time than I thought it would. I taped the butt of the shotgun with duct tape. Now I just have to test her. I also took  's bomb apart, and I no know how to make more. I must reserve the motel for Denver today. Arlene looks so beautiful now. I also ordered a pistol belt and three ammunition pouches from the Internet. Everything is falling into place at last! Today, I also saw a program on the History Channel about Charles Whitman the Texas Sniper. He was an ex-marine who killed his wife, mother and a number of other people on August 1, 1966. This year will mark the 40th anniversary. I can compare
2006-08-08‎Dear Journal, I will buy black cargo pants and black boots online to complete the uniform that Eric was wearing on April 20, 1999. I am feeling very depressed these days. I drown my sadness and depression with work, cleaning, and movies. Still, it just keeps coming back. I am a TV junkie. I have been addicted to movies and the television ever since I was born. I just became interested in Rated R movies when I was 7 years old, around the same time I was shown pornography. I am having sexual fantasies these days and fantasies of being held hostage by an evil twin brother. I assume that he represents my dark side. I can't even cry! The anti-deppressant I am taking documentariest seem to be working. On August 29 my depression will end permanently. I just want to die. I don't want to live like this anymore. I have endured 10 years
2006-08-23‎Dear Journal, In one week, I will finally be dead. I am just putting the finishing touches on my autobiography. It is in my computer, in Microsoft Word, under the name Columbine. I have almost everything ready. I just need more ammo and I need to go to church before I begin. I cannot wait. I wish I could tell my family, but I can't. I miss Anna. Today, she starts her sophomore year at  . I will always think about her. She is so beautiful. I don't deserve her though. I do not deserve anyone. If I was mentally well, maybe I couldve told her my feelings. I do feel sorry for scaring her. I know I am sick. What do you do with sick people like me. They can't change. You have to sacrifice them. Bad things could happen. We have to learn to sacrifice ourselves. I need to sleep now journal. Goodnight
2006-08-30‎Dear Journal, Today is the big day for Operation Columbine. It is time that the world be reminded of Columbine. I will die today! I just killed my father. It felt good! He is finally dead. I do feel a little remorse. Still, he is finally with God and Tony. I loved my father. I hesitated but I finally did it. God be with him.
