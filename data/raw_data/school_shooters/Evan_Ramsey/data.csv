‎I have thought to myself, what kind of damage can a 12 gauge slug do to a human's internal organs or their head? Well today I found out, and so did everyone else that is in school . . . No, I am not on drugs . . . ciggerettes, that's all. I am not really depressed just that the fact that I want people, the world, or maybe just Bethel, to know how and cruel the world is or can be. This school has got to get its together 'cause there are too many deaths this past 2–3 years. Well I can tell you that the Superintenant Sue Hare has been the nicest person I've ever met cause she took both William and I in and didn't get any money for it, and she like was a mother for William and me. But anyway I'm dead you guys are living, you should be happy.
‎Hey Every body!! I feel rejected, rejected, not so much alone, but rejected. I feel this way because the day-to-day treatment I get usually it's positive but the negative is like a cut, it doesn't go away really fast. I figure by the time you guys are reading this I'll probably have done what I told EVERYONE I was going to do. Just hope 12 gauges don't kick too hard but I do hope the shells hit more than 1 person because I am angry at more than 1 person. One of the Big is Mr. Ron Edwards, he should be there, I was told this will be his Last year, but I know it WILL BE HIS LAST YEAR. The main reason that I did this is because I'm sick and tired of being treated this way everyday . . . By the way every one allways told me “Don't Judge A Book By It's Cover.'' This saying is true because I was told that my teach- ers say that “He's Such A Good Kid.'' But they Say that About everyone. I don't think I'm a good-Hearted person. LIFE SUCKS in its own way, so I killed a little and killed myself. Jail isn't and wasn't for me, ever.
