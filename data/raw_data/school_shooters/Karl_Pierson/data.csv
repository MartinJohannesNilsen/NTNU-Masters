2013-09-17‎enter project saguntum, a 10 year subconscious project for me to exact revenge, not on the individuals who perpetrated wrong, but instead by those I believe have done me wrong. I will shoot up my school, Arapahoe high school before the year is over. I hope to choose a date with the following criterion. Finals week — everyone is at school, and it will be winter during finals week, I hope I can find a day it is actually snowing, or just incredibly cold. I am a psychopath with a superiority complex. I intend on going as follows: I walk through the asshole in the north side of the trophy hall, waltz in shooting everyone in my way to the (shouldn't be too many, it's not far, I go to the , to kill . From there, there are classrooms in the where I will do something I have wanted to do for a while-mass murder and be in a place of power where I and I alone are judge, jury and executioner.
2013-09-22‎I am filled with hate, I love it. The serotonin supplements I am taking don't do jack shit, I am still ready to start a riot, I feel like a bomb, ready to let the world feel and experience my hatred for all things of pleasure. Nothing makes me happy. When I do commit my atrocities, I want the conversation to be about elementary school teasing. Words hurt, can mold a sociopath, and will lead someone a decade later to kill.
2013-09-30‎I feel like a bomb. My head has happy, anger and confusion hormones. I feel like an aneurism could happen at any second. Besides constantly being pissed off, I doubt the medication is working. I need a real doctor, one who doesn't give medication that has the disclaimer not approved by the FDA. The serotonin is a joke, it makes my bowels upset, doesn't effusively make me happy, and I hate taking them. It is important to note I rarely take my meds for this reason.
2013-10-01‎Saguntum is the project to shoot up (and maybe bomb) Arapahoe High School. No date has been set, but I would like it before new years. Finals week would do nicely, but a date with snow should be sooner. I also imagine the idea of what I hope will happen. I take to school, drop her off, ditch the whole day until (I've thought about it and I like the most). I would also love to burn , so much destruction.
2013-10-03‎Since day 1, my job has been to conspire to shoot up the school. Every semester, I had a class I despised, and it was on the list. Now, I have means to achieve this diabolical end, and I am excited. The date is set for mid-November, I need time to build my arsenal.
2013-10-11‎I had a shrink appointment at 4, which was a massive waste of time. She doesn't know about saguntum, nobody does.
2013-10-15‎I had an interesting idea today. In first hour, I thought about shooting up the asylum or whatever the fuck it was that my mother took me for that psych evaluation. Let the records show I lied through my teeth through the test.
2013-10-26‎the 13th of December is a great date, as the 347th (47 is a great number) date of the year, there are 18 (my age) days left. It is a day of gore, filled with murder, suicide.
2013-11-06‎I am estatic right now. That December 13 date I chose is perfect, it is 38 days after the fifth of November. I love that date, that number, everything about it.
2013-11-24‎It's weird going through life knowing that in 19 days, I'm going to be dead. That makes school more boring, work torture and everything I love to do, a little less fun. The hardest part is not being able to tell anyone. I can't just say fuck it, I'm going to shoot up my school soon. I need to make sure that kind of stuff doesn't show up.
2013-11-26‎I can't believe in a fortnight I'll be dead. I went to the library to see if they had NBK. They didn't, but had highly recommended Perks of being a wallflower. I HATED it. Personally, I saw me, freshman year. No, I had never been sexually abused, but I had no friends at Arapahoe, and I was trying to fit in.
2013-12-08‎it was productive weekend. I bought my Stevens 320. It was not the initial gun I was expecting, but I think it will work better. I like the pistol grip. It was quite the process to buy, it was waiting, and waiting, but I loved it. Mom does not know about it.
2013-12-12‎I went to Cabela's and I bought a sling, ammo belts, and of course, ammo. It included 5 sabot slugs! I think I'll need more. Luckily, I'll take off tomorrow.
2013-12-13‎today is going to be fun. I dropped off at school today, and went to Walmart, bought some ammo. I then dressed my weapons, loaded my belts, got my backpack ready. I then went to Brunswick, bowled, got some mountain dew (I bought it for the glass bottles). I'm going to make some Molotov cocktails-shaken, not stirred. Update 45 minutes I built my Molotov cocktails, and I think they look great. I only had oil for three, but I think 3 will be more than enough. I am dressed to kill, long underwear, then cargo pants, under armor shirt, CCCP shirt. I have my machete on my belt, but I may re-attach that in the car.
2013-12-13‎The plan: 5th hours starts at 1214. I would want to strike 15 minutes into the hours, everyone is settled in. 1230: Initial strike on . Enter the trophy hallway, waltz into . Shoot up , toss a Molotov cocktail, reload. 1235: Assault 1240: Assault 1245: Assault 1250: Assault on
